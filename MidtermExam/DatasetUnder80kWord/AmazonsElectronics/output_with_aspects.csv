I am using this with a Nook HD+. It works as described. The HD picture on my Samsung 52&#34; TV is excellent.,positive,HD picture
The cable is very wobbly and sometimes disconnects itself.The price is completely unfair and only works with the Nook HD and HD+,negative,cable
"This item is just as was described in the original description, works without any issues to be seen. Good product",positive,product
bought for a spare for my 9&#34; Nook HD and it fit perfectly.  Very satisfied with the price much less than on the BN site,positive,price
"My son crewed my HD charger cord so I needed another one, this is exactly like the one my son destroyed.",positive,another one
"This is a good beefy 2 amp charger, but it covers two outlets on a power strip. It's ok in a regular wall outlet. The best thing is it uses a standard USB connector so it can charge more than just a Nook (I have a Kindle Fire HD+).",neutral,charger
"I lost my B&N original cable.  I looked around for an new one.  I tried  a different, cheaper model but it didn't fit my device properly so back to the drawing board.  I ordered this one.  I am satisfied.  It works exactly as expected and fits perfectly.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a spare or in lieu of the original usb cable adapter.",positive,cable
"Go to Target or Barnes and Noble instead, and pay $25 (which is still a huge markup, considering they make the thing for 50 cents.) This is the worst option if you need one of these. It's price gouging, pure and simple.",neutral,thing
"Works well, a little pricey I think for a charging cable, but then again, not losing the original would be a lot cheaper than any replacement",positive,charging cable
"This is a great buy, compared to a $60 or more a retail store.",positive,buy
This mount is just what I needed.  It is strong and sturdy.  It folds almost flat to enable the television to sit square and flat against the wall if desired and extends and rotates for angle turns.  A perfect fit as long as you match the correct visa pattern for your television.,positive,mount
"Great deal, easy to mount and it appears to be fairly sturdy. I mounted a 32 in tv on it and it works great.",positive,it
This mount works really well once you get it up and going.  Only problem is just the arms are a little goofy getting them all in the right spot.  But that's really not too big an issue considering all the different TV's and their mounting hole locations.,positive,mount
for the price you just cant beat this item. I bought it for a house I was selling so I could hang some tv and it worked great. Good quality for the price.,positive,quality
"Took a bit of work, but used this to fit an older vizio 32&#34; monitor to the wall to use as a compute monitor. Stable and like the ability to move the tv to different angles. The vizio was older and did not have the standard holes, this product fit and holds the tv very stable.",positive,ability to move the tv to different angles
I used this for my 47&#34; Samsung. Its fit/feel is great. Easy installation. Appears strong; although I personally spent way too much on the tv to risk leaving it fully outstretched with too little lag bolts for a long time! It is very convenient to be able to move it away from the wall however and I would feel very comfortable tilt or swiveling if needed. The movement is fluid and easily adjustable.I am very pleased with my purchase.,positive,movement
"This item serves its purpose as well as any other mount.  Its most appealing attribute is its large range of motion.  I am using this to corner-mount a 32"" TV and it works perfectly to hide the mount, receptacles, and cables behind the TV.  Very easy installation as well.",positive,range of motion
I love this mount.  This is the 4th one I've bought and it works great every time.  excellent seller and excellent product,positive,mount
I am very glad for buying it.  It is heavy duty and good quality for the price.  It was very easy to install.,positive,quality
this holds up my 55inch sony with ease. make sure u mount this with ur own lag screws into the heart of the 2x4 ur mounting to and u won't have any problem--u may have to make a modificatoin or two but use ur brain and figure it out-- it'll be there till the house falls!!!3inch lag screws is the way to go don't be cheap go buy em.---how much did u pay for the tv????,positive,ease
Nice quality still works great... very happy with this purchase... need to add 10 more words.. so what can I say its a wall mount that I haven't had any problems with,positive,quality
"Great bracket for small TVs.  I used it on a 19"" LCD and it worked well.  The large mounting plate may block some connections on some TVs.  Installed easily and could be adjusted to make level.  The links were very tight and need to be loosened for initial installation.  When the TV is in the desired position, you can tighten them up.",positive,bracket
"I bought this for a 22"" TV for my son. I mounted this onto the corner stud and it works great! I love the angles it can achieve. Fees Very sturdy and well built. It works perfect for my application. Very happy with this purchase!",positive,angles
"Didn't think it would work as well as it has,because the metal was a lighter guage thanwe expected, but it hardly deflected from theweight of the TV, even extended straight out.",positive,metal
"very heavy duty construction, extends, tilts perfectlya steal at this pricewill be happy to buy another 1 or 2 if needed",positive,heavy duty construction
Well constructed wall mount for TV sets up to 37 inches. The mounting  plate has numerous holes for varius sets. Plenty of extra hardware provided. Price was about 1/8th of what it would cost on the open market. I recommend it highly.,positive,wall mount
"This mount is excellent. It is very well built and sturdy. I used it to mount a 32"" TV and it fit the need perfectly. The price was also very good and much, much cheaper than what an inferior mount would cost in a retail store. I would definitely recommend.",positive,mount
Works great and is so much cheaper than the more expensive versions at the Big box stores. It is super easy to install yourself too. You just need a drill and a ratchet set to get it into the stud (oh yea a stud finder too).,positive,versions
"We bought this for the tv in our gym as it gets moved around a bit.  It's definitely sturdy and works well.  Our tv in there is 24&#34;,",positive,None

"Works like a charm! Lies flat on the wall when I want it too and pulls out and swivels like a charm when I need it too!The instructions call for it to be mounted into a stud in the wall, however mine is mounted directly into the drywall using heavy duty anchors and it works perfect as well! This is a great product for an amazing price!",positive,product
"Easey to put together and install. Used to mount a 37"" LED flat screen. Instuction say to mount the complete unit but if you mount the TV to the back plate on the ground first its a one person job. Well built product for being made in China.wish you could buy American made, better luck next time.",positive,product
I hung this in my house with great ease and it held up my 8 year old son because I wasn't going to put the 55&#34; flat screen on it to find out that it failed. Fully extends out 2 feet. This was worth the money.,positive,money
"Wanted the monitor off of the desk, so we mounted on the wall.  I would have rather had a vertical adjustment as well, but for the price, this unit does the job.",neutral,this unit
"very secure, we did have to use concrete bolts thought since we were putting it on an outside wall made of lath and plaster with concrete brick on the outside.  One of the best features is there is one piece that attaches to the tv and another that attaches to the wall.  the piece on the tv actually hooks onto the piece on the wall.  I am really happy with this purchase.",positive,features
Holds the TV fine and the articulation is great.  We use it in a downstairs bedroom where we can move it to be seen from the bed or the treadmill.  Has cable mgmt as well.,positive,articulation
Another great buy from Amazon. The local stores wanted twice the money and the other mounts were cheaply made. this mount is made well and you get a free hdmi cable and level with it,positive,mount
Just to know that the TV will sit off center of where the base is placed. Other than that it has held up and worked.,positive,TV
"Quality was excellent. Instructions were clear. It was not clear about a tilt feature, but there was enough to level it when I finished. Be careful to get the wall bracket real vertical. (I was using it for a 23 inch computer screen so I really need it to be level for reading.) Everything I needed plus lots of extra hardware for different situations.",positive,Quality
"For the price, this wall mount is great.  Not too hard to install.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is wire management.  I could not get the little loop to work.  Not a big deal at all however.  Overall, I highly recommend this product.  Well worth the money.",positive,wall mount
"Needed a corner mounted Flatscreen. This did the job well, easy to install. I had to mount in a metal stud, so I used two support boards in the back to distribute the weight more evenly. Expectations of item met at a fraction of the cost from competitors.",positive,cost
"Nothing fancy, just decent quality and simple installation.  As may have been mentioned, one must discard the provided Phillips screws that the manufacturer provides to affix the bracket to the wall stud.  Use your own.  The TV I mounted with it is an older flat-panel, so it's a little heavier than the news ones.  This thing isn't fazed, and stays where I put it.",positive,installation
Amazing how easy it is to move my 46&#34; around on this mount and able to hang off one stud. Nice quality feel to metal it is made of.,positive,mount
"Very sturdy. The arm is very stiff at first so you have to work it lose.  However, the mount works great, just make sure you get that stud just right. I was impressed with the quality and happy with the price.",positive,quality
"Don't have anything to really complain about.  EXCEPT there doesn't seem to be a way, or i'm missing it to tilt the TV up or down (ie. mounted high on the wall and pointed down towards the chair).  and i am quite savvy with tools/assembly/etc. And it is difficult to get to the bolt heads on the back of the TV to adjust the angle.  No reason to not buy it though.",positive,None
"Bought the mount for my 30&#34; Dell U3011 monitor.  It fits the Dell quite well, and I bought it for it's reach from the wall, it's ability to manipulate, and it's weight capacity.  And in all those respects, I'm quite happy.However, there is a noticeable tilt/sag to the monitor when I have the arm extended.  I'm not so concerned with sag perpendicular to the wall, as that was expected, but the rotational sag that I sometimes get.",positive,reach from the wall
"VERY HAPPY, it looks great, I'm so happy we got it. Holds good, it is a lil hard to get it to the wall. Other then that its fine I love how we have more room in our room. My husband is so happy I ordered this, it only cost us $28 free shipping and FAST(: VERY THANKFUL TO THE SELLER.",positive,seller
"I wasn't willing to pay $100 for simply mounting a TV, so I bought this item to give it a shot. I have no real complaints.  It holds the TV up, which is all I wanted.  It does not have smooth pivot points, so if you're planning on moving it around a lot, don't use this one, but if it's going to stay in a static area, this is your mount.",positive,mount
"Bought NEW but I could tell right away that mine had been repackaged and refurbished.  Plus the was missing the 4 arms but had some other random hardware included.  I made mine work for my 32&#34; set and it serves it's purpose. Just wish the seller was upfront on the condition, I could have bought a used one for $5 less.",negative,condition

Definetely a great buy at a agreat price!",positive,TV mount

"The fact that the pivot point on this TV mount was not built straight caused the TV to tilt slightly when it was swung out.  there is no adjustment for it, so i had to make a choice for the tv to either be straight and level when it was pushed against the wall, or when it was out.  i do not recommend this wall mount.to it's benefit though, it was reasonably sturdy and easy to install.",negative,wall mount
This is mounted in a doorway between two rooms in my basement with a 40 inch TV attached to it.  I can move it to either room and still keep the doorway open plenty wide enough to pass through.  Perfect for my needs.,positive,doorway

If you want a wall mount that is universal and can be moved in all directions this is the one to get.  My 42&#34; Samsung 3D tv mounted easily and the extensions were not required.  I mounted it to a stud and it seems to be very secure.  I am able to swing the tv to watch from my bed or from the lazyboy chair without a problem.,positive,wall mount
"Great wall mount at a great price.  Already fully assembled out of the box and seems built to last.  I really like the swivel and tilt as we need it when laying down in the bedroom.  Easy instructions (I'm not a carpenter).  I used this on a 32"" Samsung LED TV.",positive,wall mount
"got this to hang a 32"" sony lcd in my bedroom.  used my stud finder to locate the studs, drilled 6 pilot holes and hung it up.  and extra set of hands is helpful when hanging the mount and mounting the tv.  holes on mount lined up perfectly with my tv.  screws fit just right.no complaints.",positive,holes on mount
used it for vizio 42&#34; tv. easy to install. fit perfectly. what is there else to say? strongly recommend for everyone.,positive,fit
"I thought this was a great value for a wall mount.  I have installed a 32 inch tv in my bathroom with this unit.  It worked well with the Visio TV that I bought.  It looked it it could accomodate many other tvs because there were a variety of holes on the mounting bracket.  Is it the best quality ever, no.  It is decent quality, and it worked well for me.",positive,wall mount

"This TV mount is easy to install.  Just follow the directions included.  I installed this near the ceiling and I'm using every bit of the 15 degree downward tilt.  Properly installed, the product is rock solid.  I installed a 32"" tv on it.  I know it can hold much more.  The articulating arms are easily adjustable and if you want to tighten it down and lock it in position you can do that, too.",positive,TV mount
"This is the second VideoSecu product I have ordered. They are rock-solid, and with the range of fasteners and extra hardware they include in the package, it's hard to imagine any speaker or TV that these systems won't fit.",positive,systems
"For the price it can't be beat.  The mount is strong and sturdy.  Two sets of hands are mandatory for mounting, three would be ideal.  Once up though, it's better than most of our friends mounts.  It has full articulation, and I can swing the arm out and angle it towards my kitchen.  This is highly important while cooking buffalo wings and trying to keep tabs on football games.",positive,mount
I am using this with a 40 inch Samsung smart tv.  The extended bars were not needed.  This is very easy to mount to a wall stud with just two bolts.  Many bolts are provided to fit with your television.  It is very sturdy and able to be positioned in many different ways.  Highly recommended.,positive,Mounting
"Do not listen to other reviewers, screws that this came with are concrete only, there are no wood or dry wall screws. You will!!!! need a stud finder!!! There are 8 holes in total on a mounting plate, so it is plenty enough if you hit the center of a stud. Sturdy,good looking. There is a whole set of machine screws for(my guess)all TV types plus couple of tools that you will need.",positive,set of machine screws
I purchased this mount based on others comments beforehand and i appreciate the guidance. The problem with wall mounting flat screen TV's is to make sure the hole pattern of the mount lines up with the hole pattern on the TV you buy.

"The B&N Nook is a great device. The hardware in it makes sure there is no lag or waits while watching videos, reading books, or surfing the web. The builtin apps are great, as well as the overall layout and options. The major drawback is the inability to load 3rd party apps...but roll back to firmware 1.4.0 and load all you want before upgrading. Or root it (although Amazon Instant Video will not work after rooting).",positive,hardware
It accepts up to 32gb micro sd cards but does not work properly with a 32gb card. Mine would not boot because the card used too much energy. That was the only issue I had.

But, I did wait for a means for rooting the Nook HD to become available. Now the tablet lives up to all its potential. Rooting is quite easy and it is a great tablet",positive,screen
"The Nook preformed perfectly and was easy to set up. I checked lots of ratings before I ordered it, and they were all good.This was my first tablet so I did not realize that it did not have some of the specific features I was looking for.

This nook has a very nice format and is very easy to operate and view.  The only draw back is the Battery life is terrible.  I am charging this unit twice a day.

in my honest opinion nook is unfinished product.none of my technical books in pdf format i was able to read due to pdf reader rendering formulas all over the screen with middle-size font.i am able to see formulas in small font but then the rest of text is unreadable.formula rendering in medium font is a mess however text is readable. i would have expected developer of the device spent more time on fine-tuning the text rendering on ebook reader.,negative,text rendering

Really?eReaders are devices dedicated to reading, and thus the main inconvenience they should avoid is eye-strain.By introducing a backlit eBook, B&N; removed the key point of eReaders.If you need a device that has a backlit screen (and can afford a $283 device), why wouldn't you pay the extra $200 to get an iPad, which does the job much more efficiently?Please, correct me if I'm wrong, because I really don't get the point of this device.Thanks.",neutral,eReaders
"I bought the color Nook for a family member for Christmas. If I didn't already have the iPad and prefer Apple products, I would have purchased one of these for myself.

Bought this to transfer video from some old equipment. (Sony CCD-TRV308 Hi8 videocam and Panasonic Omnivision VHS cassette player.) It's not fancy but does the job. I prefer to use PotPlayer to capture/convert the video over the included software which works ok. I'm satisfied with this purchase.,neutral,None

This goes great with my ACER netbook.  I use it a lot to import things from other computers.  It makes things so much more convenient.,positive,None
"Works as advertised. I needed a replacement for the internal drive on my Lenovo Y510 which had failed. Since the failure on the internal drive had happened before, I didn't want to deal with that again. Having an external drive is a little unhandy but once the OS had been loaded on it, an internal drive would be rarely needed.",positive,None

It works fine to play DVDs.  Haven't used it in other applications yet.  As others have said you have to download a media player if you have Windows 8.  I used VLC media free download.,positive,None
Sometimes cheap is good. You go a long way with your buck. With this machine I ended up spending more money since it malfunctioned ever since the beginning. My computer wouldn't even recognize the damn thing. I had to install a load of drivers and still it malfunctioned. I would recommend getting a pricier apparatus that is guaranteed working from the moment you plug it in.,negative,None
I like it but it does take a minute to come on and is quite a pain going from one science to another.  Other than that it is okay!,neutral,None
Pros: Full system in a small case.Cons: having t use 2 usb portsto transfer and power system is a drawback.Overall a good external system,positive,None
No problems so far except unable to upload a program CD. Not sure if it was the CD/dvd my computer or the software but just that one disc.  That disc works in my desk top but not in this unit.  Not sure why.  All other dvd's and CD's have been working without a problem.,positive,None

These batteries work flawlessly. The charger is why I dropped a star. Sometimes it doesn't recognize the batteries.,positive,None

Of course, we'll have an array of electronic devices with us (camera, kindle, phones, etc.) and I wanted to make sure we could keep things charged as needed during our trip no matter where we ended up.

It is good and as expected. I love to have it with me for my international travel.I love it.,positive,None
"The usb charger socket was totally broken and never worked. I'm not sure what the two red lights were supposed to be for but I never saw either of them turn on either. It was difficult to fit grounded US plugs in without some serious shoving, and the fakey plastic ground doesn't retract so I couldn't use it on outlets that didn't have a ground socket (common in Hong Kong). It's also quite big and heavy to travel with.",negative,None
"Great product but is not true as they say that it charges ipads, it does not charge them at all, i would rate this a perfect 5 stars if it did, its a pitty.",positive,None
"There's not much to say, other than that the price was exceptional. The adapter set is compact and appears durable. I really wanted the USB charger plug, and figured I might as well get a complete adapter set into the bargain.",positive,None
This is a cable.  It allows power to be transfered from and outside source to my Nexus 7.  It functions exactly as advertised.,positive,None
Described as a better cable than the one that came with the Tablet. Not so! Mini USB doesn't fit and cord is very short. Sending it back ASAP.,negative,None
not worth your stress...fit loosely from the get go...I have two nexus 7 tablets and it was the same with both. went to wal-mart and bought a cheap generic one and it works great.,negative,None
"It looks just like the real thing, however it does not hook into the port as well as the original one. Not a big issue considering the price.Google is selling those for way too much, they will not get my money for such overpriced item.",positive,None
"This cable is fine, except for the fact that there is no rigid construction to keep the male end from bending. I dropped my nexus 7 from a height of 1 foot onto my bed and it bent about 45. Your best bet is the official nexus 7 charger, but beware, the USB and the cable have almost entirely seperated on the cable that came with my Nexus 7.",negative,None
"A big improvement from the stock cord provided with the device, liked it so much I am going to buy several more,because I take my nexus everywhere",positive,None

"My last memory card for my Galaxy S4 got some water damage on a camping trip a few months ago, which became apparent when all my photos became inaccessible/got deleted. I needed a fairly large and reliable memory card to replace it. I've had this microSD card for a few months now, and it has been great! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable way to store data, especially photos on the Galaxy S4.",positive,None
"I bought this for my son's GoPro and it's worked out great. I just wish I would have bought the 64gb instead of going cheap on the 32gb, but so far so good. He's a couple of months into using his camera with this card and no issues.",positive,None
Purchased this after the purchase of a camcorder that required it and would not work with a 16gig. Got the smaller card at local store because of price and wanted to compare Amazon first. Haft the price of buying it local so was worth the wait. Was in my hands a few days after ordering and would recommend that one at least look here before paying the box store price.,positive,None
This card is very good. I use it in my Gopro because that need a fast writing and reading. I recommend it.,positive,None
"I needed a class 10 card for my GOPRO and this one looked like the best deal for the size ,and I have always liked the Sandisk brand .",positive,None

Bought this for my new Gopro and away we go. Great SD card at a great price...love it love it love it.,positive,None
I liked it. I is already formatted and no need for formatting it. My galaxy s4 recognized it easily and easy to use. The only reason I gave 4 star because it is not 32G as stated and it is only 29g. I don't know if that is supposed to be or not. I am happy anyway and would recommend this sd card to every body . You won't never regret .,positive,None
Very High Quality and what a deal! Fast shipping. I trippled the memory on my Galaxy S4 for only $22.90  ship.

The cable works as advertised and the price is unbeatable. I am not using it for a camcorder but for a canon elph camera with HDMI out. The photos and videos look great,positive,None
Bought this hoping it would be as good as the $20 one at Staples. For the price...why not try it? Works great. No graininess. No interruption of transmission. Perfect length for my purposes. They must have just had an abundance and wanted to get rid of them because they are top quality.,positive,None

"Can view my pictures right from my Cannon 4Ti on my big screen TV with this.  It works great, but be sure to follow Cannon's directions.  You must have the cable connected and have the TV on before turning on the camera.  It is great to look at the pictures on the big screen before downloading them so you can pick the good pictures.",positive,None
"And I like the length....makes it much easier to make the connection between the cfamera and the TV.  My TV is mounted high on the wall, so length is essential if the camera is not to be dangling.  I haven't yet used the cable, but it appears to be strong and flexible.",positive,None
This HDMI cable is perfect for sending image and video from my digital camera to my HDTV. Being told that it isn't necessary to spend outrageous money on HDMI cable has proven true. I now have several inexpensive HDMI cables that work perfectly. I would purchase additional cables from this seller in the future.,positive,None
Works flawlessly to connect my new Canon camera to all the HD TVs that I have hooked it to.  Great pics and vids and sound.,positive,None
Works just like my shorter cables only with more optional length.  A good price for adding distance flexibility for camera to TV hookup when viewing pictures.,positive,None

this cable does work with my 5D Mark iii and my canon point and shoot...Audio seems a little off ... not sure if it is the cable or not... I mean it does not sound as crisp as listen direct from card and from computer...  No more thought is given to that...,positive,None
"I found a tiny HDMI jack on my the Canon SX20-IS powershot and found no one had one in-stock locally and special order- I needed to take out a loan. This cable worked perfectly, no issues. Now my still camera can output full HD video/audio. Signal delivered without errors to monitor. 10 feet is a good length for getting around to the back of monitors or wall mounts.",positive,None
the cable itself is very flimsy compared to the OEM Canon.  Seems to work ok so represents exceptional value for money.,positive,None

"Canon wanted $70 for a similar cable, but I bought this cable for my Canon Rebel T1 digital SLR at this remarkable price.  The cable is spectacular and my images and videos are very clear.

I'm very pleased with my purchase.",positive,None

"This HDMI cable got shipped the same day I ordered it. I was thinking it would work from my Canon SLR to my laptop to view photos after I shoot them, but it doesn't. I have a small lcd screen I use, and it works perfect...",positive,None
I bought this for the convenience of hooking up the HDMI port on my Canon camera to my HDMI tv. The length is just enough to sit back and scroll through your pictures (back and forth) at your own speed. Plugging the memory stick into the tv works as well; but you're stuck using the TV's slide show or other program to view.,positive,None
THIS MINI HDMI CABLE  WORKS GREAT WHEN CONNECTING IT TO MY DIGITAL CAMERA. I COULD VIEW MY PHOTOS IN HD WITH MY LARGE SCREEN HDTV.,positive,None
I got this to connect my Canon 7D to the TV. I like the low price and the quality of picture i get on TV but the cable is a bit hard to windup for storing in the bag. I wish the rubber compound used to make the cable is a bit softer to handle.,positive,None

"This cable works well for connecting our camcorder directly to the TV.  It's long enough to allow me to sit a comfortable distance from the TV while using the controls on my camcorder.  The connectors on the ends are not bulky, and the cable is not unnecessarily stiff.  I can coil it up small enough to tuck into the camera bag while we're on the go.  We'll see how long it lasts, but it's working great for now.",positive,None
A cable runs lifetime. Excellent product that is no longer wearing and giving good care never going to hurt you. Product 100 percent recommended,positive,None

"Works perfectly at 1080p HD and in all other Canon EOS 7d modes. Costs less than 1/4 the price of the Canon equivalent. Expensive ""high end"" cables are a scam. It would be crazy to pay more. Tip: If you have never tried displaying your HD video or stills on an HD TV through an HDMI input, you will be shocked by the magnificent quality. Absolutely no comparison to the lousy pictures you got with the old analog inputs.",positive,None
"I was looking for a light weight cable to go from a small video camera to a hdmi video capture card in the computer. Used two of these cables on two jvc camcorders, and they did not transmit a usable signal to a video card in the computer.  Changed to a heaver-weight cable that worked fine.  I plan to try it with a canon camcorder, but I suspect it will work no better. I'll probably end up returning them.",negative,None

I like to know that when I need a device I can use it when I feel like so the need to have it ready and going made me get this at home charger for my Garmin. Now I can go and around on foot and know that where there is an outlet I can charge up again and go. SLM,positive,None
"This appears to be a generic charger, not specifically designed for the Garmin Nuvi 1450 GPS, at least I could find no data with the charger that tied it to this GPS.

"I use a car charger more than i use the wall charger, but the wall charger comes in handy at the house",positive,None
I bought this AC charger for my GPS so that I could charge it in the house when I get home from a trip instead of leaving it in the car to charge.  I would recomend this to anyone.,positive,None

I didn't expect this camera to  be as good as it is. Takes good pictures and videos. But I am glad that I didn't buy from Kodac: their price is pricey. I gave less than $100 and consider this money well spent.I would recommend this camera.,positive,None

"First of all, this product charges my Garmin 1450 very slowly. I had it plugged in using this device for 3 hours and it still was not fully charged. You may as well use the blackberry cell cord to charge; it also takes this long to charge the device. The car charger will charge the 1450 fully in about 1 hour. Waste of my money.",negative,None
these were a great addition to my gps but i wish i didn't have to buy everything seperatly but this is necessary to the gps,positive,None
I bought the wall charger because I bring my Garmin into the house each night.  I thought it would be easier to have it charge at night for use the following day. Now I don't need to use the car charger unless the battery gets low during extended use.,positive,None
Works as escribed. Shiiping container damaged but no harm to the charger. I use it to charge my Garminwhen I use it at home.,positive,None
This product was ultra cheap at $3.18 however it didn't work. Apparently it is possible to spend too little. You get what you pay for! For $8.50 I purchased a plug adapter and lighter adapter that works by allowing a standard USB cord to be plugged into either. The alternate vendor's product worked well.,negative,None
"BOTTOM LINE>DOESN'T WORK AT ALL&lt;>DOES NOT CHARGE NUVI 1450&lt;SELLER TOOK MY MONEY, CAUSE NOT WORTH RETURNING. Plug it in, turns on, turns off, no charge. Can't even work on it while plugged in.",negative,None

It has worked well with no problems. That is the short and sweet. This sentence is added  to satisfy the word count.,positive,None
This unit works as advertised.  Not the best charger I have ever used but not the worst.  It allows me to keep my Garmin topped off with power prior to embarking on a trip.  (Could be real useful if you use your GPS city feature to explore an urban landscape by foot.)  All in all this unit has performed to expectations and is small enough to store with my other GPS accessories.,neutral,None
The charger that came with my Garmin was no longer functioning so I was pleased to find this item.  It is worth buying.  It was packaged securely and arrived very quickly.,positive,None
"Garmin Nuvi 800 series Standard Red LED Wall / AC / Home Charger is a time and Battery Saver, also, the price was right.I needed it for a phone and GPS battery charger.So far it's a work horse and worth the money, if you needed it of coarse.",positive,None

I used it once. Worked jus' real good.Can't find it now - it's probably with the 87 other AC adaptors I have because the idiots in the electronics industries can't agree on one or two standard charger voltages and connector shapes... grrrr....,positive,None
It's difficult to write a specific review for this product.  It either works or it don't.  It works.  That's what I want it to do.,positive,None

I uploaded All of United States and Canada via Garmin and have all the space I need for my GPS.,positive,None
I needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. This one did the trick.,positive,None
This is the card that is needed to fit the rest of the maps and traffic updates onto the Garmin nuvi 1450. Works great.,positive,None
Works fine in my Garmin and for a 4GB card the price is right.  I would recommend it to a friend.,positive,None
"Very pleased with my purchase. I needed a AD card for my GPS to download updates, maps, and fun vehicles. This works great. No problems.",positive,None
I needed this card to update my maps in my Garmin because there was not enough room on the Garmin to fit all the new maps.  This card worked fine.,positive,None
"Now I can install the full maps on the micro SD card (4 GB), and have the full 1.8 GB available on the GPS for vehicle, voices and other extras.Awesome memory. Highly recommended",positive,None
The sd card is fine. But it doesn't work with the Garmin Nuvi 1450 LMT. I specifically ordered this for my GPS. But it doesn't seem to be compatible with it.,negative,None
"Got this for my Garmin nuvi. I understand the original use of card was for portable devices. Nevertheless, it is too small and easy to lose. Now I have to lug around this slightly larger SD card to adapt it to my PC. I'll probably lose it before the next time I try to update the software on the really tiny card. Clunky design overall.",neutral,None
"I bought this for my Garmin Nuvi (can't remember the model number) with lifetime map updates, a 5 inch screen, and live traffic updates.  It works great to update the US & Canada Maps because you need about 1.6GB to update those!",positive,None
I was having problems with my Garmin nuvi 1450.  I could not download map updates. This 4gb card solved the problem perfectly.It was easy to install and now I have updated my maps.,positive,None
When I began updating the maps I was confronted with &#34;no memory&#34;. I didn't realize my Garmin had a place for a SD card! duh&#8230;I ordered this one because Kingston is a quality company and the price was right. Perfect. I'm all caught up on my GPS updates and assume this 4GB card will last the life of the GPS and not fill up.,positive,None
"I was not happy that I needed a micro card for my nuvi - I get lifetime maps but nowhere to put them, lol. and the card available through garmin cost three times the price of this one!!

For some reason couldn't find high bias cassette tapes around town. Amazon to the rescue. No problems or complaints with this product.,positive,None
"THIS PRODUCT IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE AT J AND R.  YOU ENTER  YOUR INFORMATION AND THEN GET TO THE PLACE WHERE IT SAYS: ""PLACE YOUR ORDER"" AND THE CART GOES TO ""0"".  REAL DRAG.  i CALLED JANDR TWICE ABOUT REMOVING THIS PAGE FROM AMAZON BUT THEY SAID IT TAKES TIME.",negative,None
"I use this in my car to play mp3's of Rock, D+B, Electronic and some Metal and it all sounds good. Convenient feature allows the cord to come out of either of 4 spots on the cassette so it can fit in any car and lets you control where the cord goes. No problems yet, it does as advertised and as always Amazon rocks with fulfillment.",positive,None
"The cassette, as other have said, makes a clicking noise as it runs.  I have it in a 2001 Rav4 OEM stereo.  It will also cut out when tracks change on the music player.  Very annoying.  I would not have bought this except for the Maxell name.  Disappointed.",negative,None
Use this to play my ipod in my nissan maxima tape player. Works great and the audio is pretty good. Better then radio quality but not cd quality.,positive,None
It works fine and is a pretty good product.  I picked this one over 4 other ones because it was cheaper and had okay reviews.  It does the job well.,positive,None
I got this several years ago so my daughter could listen to her iPod through the family car radio which does not have an AUX input.It does not provide super fidelity but such a device can't ever be compared to a direct connection.It works good (certainly met my expectation) and it still gets used occasionally to play mp3s from my phone.,positive,None
My other adapter was taken from my car so I needed a replacement. I am satisfied with this one. It does the job well! I'm glad I bought it. :),positive,None
This works perfect for hooking up my phone to my old tape player in the car. The cord is probably 4 feet so plenty of room to move and it seems to be quality. Mine does make a slight clicking sound when playing but this could be caused by the car tape player and not he adapter.,positive,None
"This works great and saved me $$$$ that a newer vehicle would have cost.  Plug it in and listen to whatever you've got on your phone or access stations through your phone.  It's fun to listen to foreign stations, etc.",positive,None
"I ordered this after much searching.  I ordered this one to go in my Toyota Sienna 2001 which has a cassette deck. I chose this brand because I trust it more than the cheaper ones.  It plays good through my car stereo.  The sound is good enough, not as  great as when you have earphones on, but nothing will sound that good when you are in a car anyway. So far I am satisfied with it.",positive,None
Works fine. The only Caveat is that you may need to manually switch the end where the cable comes out to match the  direction of your cassette player.  When used as configured my player rejected it until I changed the end the cable came out.  I would have preferred a product that did not require configuration.,positive,None
"Has a little hum, but the highs are crystal clear. Sounds as good as cd.",positive,None
I use this in my older model truck to listen to my ipod. I have used different FM transmitters in the past and was never really happy with the sound quality. This is the way to go. I wish I had tried it before!,positive,None
"I was force to buy this since the one that came with my Sony portable CD player and my cassette player in my car didn't get along! I had one of these for years but time got the best of it. SO if I have to get another one, this was my only choice since it works without ANY drama!",positive,None
arrived on time.  Was brand new as described. I like this product because it brings out a little more bass in the sound.  This is actually the first stereo cassette adapter I've seen that has an extra bass feature.  I recommend it very highly...,positive,None
We got this player because another brand would not work in my husband's Taurus. It kept giving us an error message and he could not use it with his Ipod. This one does not have the same problems. It works every time. We are very happy.,positive,None
LOVE these adaptors ! i got this one  mainly for my car... since it  has a  combo cd/cassette deck(which is awesome)this little  gem  does the trick...i use this to play  my mp3 players (sony and an ipod )  the audio quality is superb.. its  crystal clear..  i  also use this in the house on my stereo system...this is a great buy! and its worth it  to have a few of these on hand...you never know when youll need one.,positive,None
"Works well, purchased as a replacement for another that just wore out over time. Sound quality is very good with no sounds or squeaks from the cassette player.",positive,None

"After ordering and returning the Coby brand version, which did not work at all, I am pleased to report this one works fine.  I bought it to play tunes from my Sandisk mp3 player on my car cassette deck, and this unit fits the bill nicely!",positive,None
This works great. It shouldn't be that difficult and it isn't. We used it to connect an iPod to my wife's car stereo. The sound is just fine--much better than an FM transmitter we used in the past.,positive,None
It works. It wasn't expensive. What more can you ask for?  Only use it for the car. And so for 15 bucks it represents the cheapest way to wire my pod.,positive,None
"This makes it easy to clean your cd player. It tells you what to do when you play it and is not liquid based. Good cleaner and for dirtier lenses, make sure you use a few times to get it good. Always good to have one of these around.",positive,None
This arrived in only two days so I popped it in on the way to pick up the kiddos. This directions are on the disc and really simple. The cd makes an annoying beeping sounds while cleaning ( I turned the radio down and kept checking for it to finish) but that is my only dislike. The packaging was very study.  I will definitely buy from this seller again.,positive,None
Did not resolve the issue with my car dvd drive.  When I put it in the drive ejected it as it did with dvds.I beleive it is ok. Just haven't tried it in any other dvd drives I have.,positive,None

"The product is not recommended for note book optical drives, but I used it anyways and it seemed to work.",neutral,None
"It worked great for me, but look out the handle on it may break off as it did me. I found out that you really don't need it. The reason I gave it 5 stars is the fact it really works.",positive,None
"I tried to use it in my 2008 Ford Explorer factory CD changer.  No luck.  It would just spit it out when it got to the brush section.I know some others had said it worked for them in their car decks and changers, but sadly, it did not work for me.If anyone has any ideas or tips that might help it work, I'm all ears.",neutral,None

Just as described.,positive,None
"Received the shipment on-time, but the first thing I noticed when opening the box were the words ""not for laptop use"" written on the package.  There was no mention anywhere in the specs or description of this item on the site that said it was only for laptops, so since I only have a laptop, I have now needlessly purchased a product I cannot use.",negative,None

I was ready to purchase a new CD Player because the one I had wouldn't recognize any CD/DVD's.  I read quite a few ofthe reviews and based on price and reviews I decided on this one.  I installed this cleaner into the player and followedthe instructions and in less than a minute everything was working like new.  Great product.,positive,None
got this to clean a dvd drive and it wokred as intended . its good and useful good buy recommened,positive,None

"I tried this with a CD-ROM player that was not recognizing the CD. Initially it seemed to help a little bit. But the problem returned quite soon. So I tried using the cleaner again, I think three times in a row. The problem really never went away.",negative,None
"It really worked for me I noticed a difference after the first application but I actually had to run it maybe 5 times total but now no more skips! Might depend on just how dirty your lens is. Another plus is the equipment test it can also run on your system, found out my system was out of phase and I didn't know it. Just a fantastic product get it!!Tom",positive,None
Good  headphones.  I like (very much) that they only have a wire on one side  and they are lightweight..The sound is pretty good. I enjoy using them.,positive,None
"My job involves wearing earphones ALL THE TIME.  so if they are tight, my ears get sore and especially where my eyeglasses go behind my ears.  These are perfect with really good sound.",positive,None
"These headphones are perfect for the walking iPod/iPhone listener. No buds in ear, no strand ear canal. I use other headphones but these are good, like the fold in ear pads. Cord could be about 6&#34; longer, but still okay.",positive,None
"Another good buy.  Again, very affordable, and they work.  Far less expensive than buying them in a drugstore.  I like the single wire, it seems to be much easier to manage than two of them..",positive,None
This is a great set of headphones cheap only in price.Fidelity is fine.Design and light weight are impressive.,positive,None
"I have several pairs of another brand for my classroom and they're pretty good. I bought this one to compare and it just feels a little cheap. Considering that I buy a pair every month or so, I'll try some other brands.",positive,None

"I use tapes over and over. Maxell has been the best so far, use to use TDK but they failed way to soon. I have a Maxell standard I've used 25 times. I tape a lot of stuff Maxell high grade is superior to thier Maxell standard,  for movies you want to save, Maxell high grade will do the job.",positive,None
Maxell has always been a good brand of vhs tape and this did not disappoint me. I like it alot.,positive,None
i use this brand because they last me for years. i use them weekly and they have good video and audio qualities.,positive,None

"After I initially had some problems, the seller sent me a replacement tape free of charge via Priority Mail.  (Initial delivery was also more rapid than expected.)  The problems now appear to have been because of some programming inconsistency with one of my VCR recorders. Both tapes are now serving well.",positive,None
"We were getting very grained tapes that we could not play back very well. After cleaning the heads with this wet cleaner, we now get a very clear play back picture. Good product.",positive,None

This is a good wet cleaner. Works great and cleans the tape head so you no longer see static. Simple to use and can be used many times.,positive,None

"Believe it or not, some of us still use VHSOnly because we are digitizing them now. Converting an analog tape to digital media takes its toll on a VCR and the heads get dirty beyond recognition. Eventually I'll have to tear down my deck to clean it properly but for now this cleaning tape really helps",neutral,None
"I tried to play some tapes I'd had stored for a long while, they were defective from age and humidity and made my VCR dirty and unusable.  This headcleaner took a few uses to clean the heads, but it got the gunk off and now the VCR works as well as when it was new.",positive,None
"These products are hard to find anymore. While it does appear that this product does clean the heads, the one thing it does not appear to do, is rewind the tape upon completion. Do not know why it is becoming difficult to find tape head cleaning products such as this anymore considering that the DVD/VHS players are still being sold.",positive,None
"My hubby and I bought this Wet Cleaner, due to the fact that we still have VCR's at home. Needed this cleaner to keep the heads clean after much usage. We liked it, but eventually, we will have to join the 21st Century and start getting DVR's  since it is impossible to but new (old) VCR's. It did the job, but this product can not be used all the time!",positive,None
"This was the perfect fix for my VCR!!  I did have to run it through about three times before it was clean and functional, but worth the time and effort.  Liquid drops do come with it.",positive,None

this cleaner works very well it is just as advertised and I would recommend this to anyone who needs a cleaner.,positive,None
We still use our VCRs to watch older tapes and occasionally the units get dirty and project striations on the screen so that the picture is obscured.  This happens probably once a month.  A couple drops of the Maxell VCR Wet Cleaner on the cleaner unit clears up all problems.  The product does exactly what it advertises.,positive,None

Excellent VHS head cleaner! Been buying Maxwell products for years now and have never had any problem's or anything at all wrong with them!,positive,None

The Maxell VP-200 VHS Wet Cleaner far exceeded my expections and I will be ordering more of them from you soon. I highly recommend this seller and this product.,positive,None
I was and still am having thumping noise whenever we use the VCR.  This did nothing to help or fix the problem.  Years ago I used a similar product with great results for a similar problem.... is it because the VCR is old or this cleaner???,neutral,None

Title says it all. This product is so simple and easy to use that even novice photographers should buy this.,positive,None

"it's one of the better shower radios for sure, but it still sounds like a shower radio.",positive,None
"PROS: Good audio, easy to program, good features.CONS:However, the FCC will require broadcasters to switch to a digital format in February 2009.  At that time, the radio WILL NO LONGERr receive televison broadcast audio.  Therefore, a good percentage of the radio's value is gone!Nationwide, the FCC has reserved 10 weather channel frequencies available.  Usually all 10 can't be received.  This radio only has 5 channels for weather.  In my case, none of those 5 channels contains any weather signals.",neutral,None

"I have had this shower radio for several months.  I purchased a similar model for my parents several years ago.  I liked is so much, that I finally decided to purchase one for myself.  Not only can this shower radio withstand exposure to water, but the quality of the sound and reception is excellent for its size.  It is very intuitive to use.",positive,None
Picked this one up based on the reviews of this site.  Absolutely worth it.  Great sound and ease of use.,positive,None
This is a nice little radio.  It has good sound quality & it's easy to tune and to set up the clock and the station presets.  The timer function is useful since it does run on batteries.  My only issue is that I wish an AC adapter was included so that I didn't always have to run it on batteries.,positive,None

We've used one since the late '90s and, even though the OFF button has long since worn through, it still works like a charm.I've purchased others as gifts for bewildered friends and once they've spent a little time with it they love it.Target and other stores have stopped selling them as off-the-shelf retail, but I hope SONY continues to make this little C-battery shower radio and doesn't screw it up with any ""improvements.""",positive,None

"Great reception, easy to use and good sound for a one speaker radio.",positive,None
I have tried several waterproof radios and these Sony's are the only ones that work well. If the volume went a little louder I would have given it 5 stars.,positive,None
The sound quality is pretty good and the radio reception is very good.  Previous shower radios we had were far worse in both areas.  I especially like the programable buttons since we each like different stations.  Even though the screen fogs the LCD is still readbale.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think the price is a bit high for a shower radio.,positive,None
"A wonderful product. Well-built. Very clear reception. Easy set-up. The flat, broad bottom is a great feature as it prevents tipping it over when it is placed on a surface such as a sink.Be aware that the TV channel reception feature will cease in 2009 when all transmission goes digital. Until then, enjoy it!",positive,None
"This is without a double the 'best' shower radio I have ever owned.  The reception is crisp and clear and I love the pre-programmable stations.  It is also a very attractive radio and so when not in the shower with me, it looks nice sitting on my bathroom counter.  It's very user friendly; no complicated directions.  Perfect for us 50+ technically challenged.  I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.",positive,None
"I purchased this for my dad who uses it in a basement sauna.  The radio sounds nice and is easy to use, but does need to be positioned a bit for good reception.  He is very happy with the radio.",positive,None
This radio is nice with digital display and nice membrain push buttons. the battery capacity is good.. lasts a long time.. the thing that is disapointing is that you can not recieve any weather stations even though other radios in the area do!! also the am reception is no better than the 20 year old radio I replaced..,positive,None

"I selected this radio for myself several years ago and I have found that all claims for it are true.  It has excellent reception, clear sound, and the batteries last forever.I don't use mine in the shower itself, but sitting on the cabinet. Volume is very good.My recent purchase was a gift; there was no other shower radio that seemed to work as well. They were cheaper, but if they don't work, what have you gained?",positive,None
"If your looking for a radio for your shower, then look no further.  This gets great reception and the timer to shutoff feature is very handy.",positive,None
Reception is outstanding.  Easy to set up stations.  Timed on/off is automatic. Easy to read display. Great sound for a mono speaker.  Battery life is amazing.  Worth the price.  I would happily repeat the purchase if I manage to wreck this radio.Update:  The TV function of this radio is not functional with the digital TV change over.,positive,None

"This is my first DVD after thinking about it for two months.  I've only purchased it since DVD's are entering the Rental market.  With 500 lines of resolution (Using the S-video connector cable), this system has the same  picture quality of any current DVD player (dont be fooled!), The sound can  still be decoded for dolby surround.  Great Buy!",positive,None
"I was initially concerned about buying the RCA 5220P DVD player after several of the reviews I read here. However, I decided to give it a try and am thoroughly glad I did. Great picture, great sound! Plenty of features. I  have not experienced a single problem with error messages on any of the  DVD's I've purchased. This is one great little machine for the price!",positive,None
"This is ok if you just want a cheap, portable radio but the reception leaves a lot to be desired. Many AM stations that are easy to get on my other radios were non-existent on this.",neutral,None
I wanted a radio to listen to NPR for a few minutes in the morning without putting on the stereo.  I did not want a CD or tape player.  This is a good little basic radio and I am pleased with it.,positive,None
"This radio might work better if you live in areas with strong radio signals. In the fringe area I live in, it doesn't work at all,whereas the little ten dollar Panasonic RF-P50 Pocket AM / FM Radio works quite well.",negative,None
"So great, I bought one for everyone in my family.  The ultimate Christmas present.  Great range, clear sound and when plugged in it charges the batteries.  Incredibly durable too.",positive,None
"For the price, you can't beat this sturdy radio.  Great sound, and durable.  Use it in the garage and around the deck and it's got great volumn and clarity.  You can't beat the deal that GE is providing.  Second model owned, had their original model for 13 yrs and was so impressed I got a new one.",positive,None
I bought the original version of this radio back in the late 70s. We've had this one for over two years.  It's a great basic radio with loud enough sound for shop/work use.  We left it in the Vegas sun and it melted the case a little.  It still works!,positive,None
This radio does a great job of receiving local channels and picks up AM stations from hundred of miles away.,positive,None
"If you like to listen to AM talk radion, sports or news this radio is unbeatable.  I have the Sony ICF SW7600GR and the AM section can't hold a candle to the Superadio III.Personally I think the tuning and volume pods are smooth and fairly precise compared to what others have found.  I am amased that this unit gets the job done for $40.00.It does what it says.  Hope this is helpful.",positive,None
"It is very large but does have pretty good sound and reception, I live in an area where some people cannot get half of what I get on this unit....buy again because of performance...yes.....buy again .... maybe not because of size being so large....",positive,None
This was my third purchase of this Model.  I had been using these for listening to stations distant to my rural home for several years but this 'New' set didn't have near the range or tone quality of the prior sets that I had purchased over the  years.  I changed to CC Radio plus Sets which do what I had wished this GE set would do.,negative,None
"I've owned a GE SUPERADIO since 1985. Works great. Sounds Fantastic. Pulls in stations from great distance.  Seems bulletproof. I especially enjoy the Old School knobs and dials. They are no- brainers. Spin the dial, turn it up. Done. No digging into digital layers.",positive,None
"I bought this radio in the early nineties to be my night companion. It's showing signs of wear now, doesn't tune like it used to, and the antenna doesn't stand up anymore (keeps flopping over), but the SuperRadio has been more than worth the money, although I don't remember buying it for as much as they want for it here!",positive,None
I Like this radio. Pulls in AM stations great. Has nice sound quality. I've even dropped this on the floor a few times. Still works great. Very durable. Battery life is excellent! Happy with this radio.,positive,None
"Good sound, good options. A bit larger than you might think from the picture. Sound is good, as is reception. I have it on the back corner of the desk as background music.",positive,None
Really excellent reception.  Very good sound quality.  Separate treble and bass controls.I was surprised by the good reception.  Highly recommended.,positive,None
I recently recieved this item. The reception is about the same as my Grundig s350. I took off 1 star  because on fm I cant get 103 cleary but my grundig can get it better. Is it because the antena is too small? Or is it that I need to modify it??? The am reception is good. The sound is better than the grundig s350!!! Over all the radio is good.,positive,None
"Very sensitive radio on AM, widely considered the best buy for the money by far.  Very popular in prisons because of its daytime distance performance.Sound is top rate.Dial calibration is poor but you can  get used to it.It's exactly as sensitive as the CCRadio at $160 with  much better sound than the CCRadio.  Lacks only the CCRadio's digital  tuning.  Sorry, Art Bell.",positive,None
"I bought this a while back for the garage and was fairly disappointed. It uses old tuning technology and the station would continually drift. The sound was ok, but a little bassy. I'm guessing a lot of people buy it for nostalgic reasons. I ended up selling it.",neutral,None
"it is sensitive and because of it range, you can tweek in stuff from far away, and then flick a switch and pow even more range....had a halicrafters 3 band radio beck when I was a kid, it had range with the external antenna, but this is a very good radio, under battery power or plugged in..............good buy for the price!!!!!",positive,None

I bought this a few years ago and works well for the phone connection that my DVR's require.  I've had no problems with this unit.,positive,None
I purchased this product to provide phone connection to my DSS receiver. I do not have a phone line in that area and this seemed like a nice solution to the problem. This is a low data rate application and voice quality is clearly not of concern. The product was easy to install and worked perfectly for this application.,positive,None
"I got this for a friend to use on his dial up modem, and it works flawlessley.Great buy.",positive,None
"Used a Panasonic 2.4Ghz phones as the extension and it would not get a dial tone.  Plugged in a simple corded phone and it worked just fine.So, beware, the operation of the unit is uncertain.",negative,None
"These worked OK for a while, then they died.  Reset button and repeated attempts to connect failed.Not recommended.",negative,None
"If you need to add a phone extension without cables or need to hook up a fax machine this product is ok, but for modems and internet connections, your speed will go dooooooown to 9600 or even less.",negative,None

"The headline on this review says it all.  I'm not mechanically gifted in the least but this RCA Wireless Phone Jack did not test my technical acumen.  (Thank goodness).It's easy to set up, just click in a couple of leads, plug it in the wall and voila!, instant dial tone, good to go and Bob's your uncle.",positive,None
"I installed this product and tried several A/C outlets,but the phone always produced backgound hiss and static.Within a week it quit working and I could not get the transmitter light to come on after that so returned the unit for a refund.  I got a different brand that does not have the background noise.  I hope it lasts.",negative,None
"This product does not have caller ID and makes a hissing sound that is irritating. I bought it from BuyAccessories, who weregreat with customer service and refunded my purchase. I will buy from them again. It's not their fault the product is mediocre.",negative,None
this little gizmo works fine for most phones but it DOES NOT work with phones with caller ID.  Keep that in mind when you're considering a purchase.  Works great with the others.  Overall a nifty little device.,neutral,None
I bought this a few years ago and works well for the phone connection that my DVR's require.  I've had no problems with this unit.  This was an expansion for RCA RC926.,positive,None
These RCA wireless connectors are okay for basic phone conversation over short distances.  Don't bother trying to use them for data such as with TiVo or a computer.  They simply won't work.  They use a fairly old technology and even basic phone conversation can result in interference from other devices in the house.,negative,None
"I thought I ordered both receiver and transmitter, had to re-order by phone. They told me they would send me a R.A. by email and I never got it now I'm stuck with two orders.",negative,None
"I bought this product to connect my Directv line. There is 25ft. between sender and receiver. All I get on my phone is static. I have tried SEVERAL locations in the room.

"This extension requires one of the following Wireless Phone Jack Systems: RCA RC 926, GE GE926 or D916.  (per packaging).  It does NOT work with the RCA RC 930, which Amazon is bundling with it.  Don't buy it with the RC 930!",negative,None
"Excellent product while it lasts.  I have yet to have one of these last for more than four months.  I usually purchase a few at time so that I always have a spare for when ever it no longer works.  Because the telephone is so uncomfortable to hold, a handset is a necessity and this is the best one to have.  Unfortunately, it does not last for too long.",neutral,None
I've owned several of these items and all were inferior and really useless. This unit fits well and the sound quality I hear is superb. I've asked those I've talked with how they hear me and they say it is also loud and clear. Guess I'd have to give it a total of five stars.,positive,None
There appears to be an engineering flaw in the plug connection for the microphone wire.  I have two of these units where you can hear the caller but they cant hear you.  This is too bad because the sound quality is very good for the price.,negative,None
The only thing it was missing is the volume slider with mute button. I had it on the previous Uniden headset. Otherwise it works great and I am happy with the 3 I bought.,positive,None
Headset is comfortable and works well. I can still get things done around the house while talking on the phone and this is a great help.  Only drawback is that microphone is mounted on plastic mouth piece and this limits adjustability for the distance from mouth to microphone.,positive,None
This is a great headset.  The volume is just a little lower than I would have expected but overall I am very happy with this headset and I would buy another if I had the need.,positive,None
This is the 5th wireless phone jack I have purchased.  It worked for maybe 2 months then died.  Tried to reset but it would not connect. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,negative,None
Used this for all of about 5 minutes.  Couldn't connect at all.  Gave one star only because I couldn't give 0.,negative,None
Unfortunately this wireless modem jack had a substantial amount of line noise.  I was able to connect to the internet at 1/10th the normal speed due to the insufficient connection.  I will give this to another family member to try in a newer house.,negative,None
"This worked well to transfer a caller ID signal to an area where I have a cable box and TV.  This was very good for my needs, but I did listen to the line and it was noisy when using some outlets.  I also had a tough time finding two different outlets that would ""talk"" to each other and transfer the caller ID signal; but after a lot of trial and error it seems to work flawlessly.",positive,None
"It was difficult to set up, and it does NOT work with the RC920 extension that Amazon is combining with it, but it does ultimately work.",neutral,None
"I made the mistake of buying the RCA Wireless Phone Jack to connect my TIVO downstairs in the living room where I don't have a jack.  It did not work.  Once I finally re-read what I needed, I bought the RCA Wireless Modem Jack.  It works perfectly and I haven't had any problems.",positive,None
I bought this for a spare bedroom where we did not have a telephone jack. Installation was a snap and it works great. Sound quality is awesome and in addition you can use it to connect an access point router to expand the reach of your Wi-Fi network.,positive,None
"I tried this to use a fax two floors above my Vonage phone modem with fax outlet and performance was very spotty.  Sometimes it worked, but many times I'd get a ""poor line condition"" error message when I tried to fax.I finally broke down and ran telephone wire to that room through the walls.  It was a pain, but I finally got my fax to work all the time.",negative,None
Works ok. Not worth the price tag new. I purchased refurb for half the price of new. Sounds is not CD quality. Sound is similar to FM radio as the device broadcasts over a FM signal. I live in a condo and placed 1 speaker in each bedroom and hooked the unit up to my stereo in the living room. Now I can listen to my Comcast Music Choice and CDs thru out my home.,negative,None
Liked the reception of this vs. the Garmin unit I had previously. But soon learned that maps are the way to go. I upgraded to a Map330 soon after trying the 315.,neutral,None
"This is my first GPS unit and I could not be more pleased.  It is simple to use and easy to carry.  I have used it to mark Civil War battle sites and to find bench marks.  It takes me right to the bench marks.  If you are looking for a good unit, the 315 is the one you are looking for.",positive,None
"Screen small...hard to read while driving.Battery eater. I use the DC adapter, however.No maps.Not enough contrast on screen.

"I have a couple DVDs that had relatively small scratches on them, but deep enough to stop playback and I was able to get them to work correctly.  It did take a couple applications, but the sections where the DVD would stop and shut off, now play continuously through.  Make sure to follow the directions and wipe as the instructions say and the disc will work fine after everything dries.",positive,None
"I bought this repair kit so I could watch a rental movie.  It had quite a few scratches and was skipping during the early parts.  After I was done, I had even more scratches and the movie skipped in the exact spot it did before.",negative,None
I bought 2 of these kits hoping they would work.  I have found them absolutely useless at $10+ per kit.  I will continue to search for a product/system that REALLY works.,negative,None
Bought these for a long airplane ride. They worked pretty well for a few days but then the right side went out. That seems to be pretty common with this set. Also the battery compartment is in the cord and in a really awkward position where it hangs free and pulls on the headphones on one side.,negative,None
"I got these headphones long time ago and still enjoy them! They are so good - you just listen to your music and nothing else outside. They have few jacks to fit to different systems, so it can be universal to many audio electronics. Also it stratches somewhat, so it can fit to different sizes of head.",positive,None
"These were great at first purchase, but they did not hold up very well. They were used only inside the home and handled carefully.  One side speaker went and then a few months later, the other one stopped as well.  They lasted less than one year.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.We opted INSTEAD for PHILLIPS O'NEILL SHO9561/28.  These are extremely comfortable around your head, noise-reducing, fab sound.",negative,None
"Very nice.  I used them as wireless headphones for quite some time before finding myself in a situation where I needed a headset and microphone combination.  I remembered that these had that feature - it was not one I could figure out on my own though, I did need to reference the directions as to where to plug everything in at, but maybe that's just me.  Anyway, once they were all set, they functioned wonderfully!",positive,None
"There is a slight reduction in regular, low-frequency noise as in air travel, but these are not nearly as effective as Bose or Audio-Technica.",negative,None
"I had these for only a few weeks and they have quit working entirely.  Fiddling with the cord doesn't help.  For $50, I expected much better quality.  I am sadly disappointed and will not buy any headphone that says ""Maxell"" again - you can't trust anybody these days, they've all gone for cheap and to heck with quality.",negative,None
"The sound quality is good, the fit comfy and the close-fitting cups make for good sound isolation even without the NR on.  When you turn on the NR, though, you'll hear that annoying jet engine hiss disappear into a faint background hum.YES.  I don't even listen to music with these.  I put them on, turn them on and then just SLEEP for the flight.AWESOME.",positive,None
"I got these headphones in June. By August the sound in one ear was cutting out. I could move the wire and get it back temporarily. Fine, if you don't move your head. Now it's October and the sound in that ear is gone for good. That good price for noise cancelling headphones, isn't so great for only 5 months. Guess they are meant to be disposable.Don't waste your money!",negative,None
These cassette tapes work well for my needs.I use them for lectures and not for music.I'm happy that they are still available.,positive,None
"I have used Maxell Cassettes for over 30 years and never have been disappointed.  If you ar an audio purist, don't purchase this, go for the higher bias.  For normal folk like me with tin-pan ears, this product carries audio to near perfection and at a real bargain price, whether that price is retail or sale.",positive,None
"it's funny to appreciate a source for these tapes, but I do.  I may be old fashioned, but I still like using my cassette player and tapes.",positive,None
"I immediately passed this link to friends still using Magnetic Cassette tapes. They are getting harder to locate and this brand, length and packaging are excellent. Arrived on time and in perfect condition. I might add that the box looked like it had a hard shipping experience. No damage to tapes, or their plastic cases.",positive,None
"I ordered micro cassettes and got these, I was angered by the miscommunication and went with another seller, got exactly what I wanted so I am happy. I did not try these out. I don't have a standard cassette recorder.",negative,None
"I always order these cassettes online. Although people now use CD's, I give a taped session to my clients as a courtesy so I don't have to deal with burning CD's. Buying online is less expensive and easier to find. Saves me the trouble of locating a store that still carries them. Usually one Walgreen's that I know of has them but its hit or miss.",positive,None
"if you love to record music from cd's or the radio, & dont want to pay an arm & a leg for good quality tapes, these are for you!  i have bought 3 '15' count packages of them so far. im very happy. i intend to buy more.",positive,None

I have never gotten a ""bad"" tape or had tapes break.",positive,None
If you have an old VCR that still works and you enjoy taping your TV shows you now know how hard it is to find tapes. This will more than likely become even harder.  We located these on Amazon. They are a great buy and are becoming very difficult to find. These Maxwell takes are of very good quality and the prices if fantastic.,positive,None

"there's not much choice for vhs tapes now, I'm happy I can still find them on Amazon. I would give this a better rating if one of the tapes hadn't had a broken piece internally, I could hear it rattling and when I took the tape apart there was a piece snapped off. but they were cheap enough that I didn't bother to return the package.",neutral,None
"These are really nice tapes, they record well the first time and re-record over and over. Still have a vcr to record tv occasionally and these work well",positive,None
I have used these VHS Tapes before and the quality is great each time.  I will buy these the next time for making copies.  Darryl,positive,None

"I have used Maxwell for some time. I liked the price and having used these in the past, you can retape over them many, many times. I use them to tape television shows on air after my bedtime.

We, like everyone else, got rid of our VCR back when we made the transition to DVD, but in the last couple years we longed for a bit of nostalgia, so we bought a VCR, some tapes and these blank tapes to re-experience what it was like watching VHS as kids.

The price was right and the quality is what you'd expect on a vhs. I am using these to record mini-dv films and would recommend,positive,None
Maxell is a well trusted brand that has quality products. Bought these because I still use a video recorder. Have never had any problems with them and am sorry to see them go.,positive,None
A couple of the tapes required break in and I suggest a fast forward and rewind before you start recording. I have DMRs and record TV shows on EP mode. Both sound and video are good even on a 60&#34; 3-D Plasma and 350w sound system.,positive,None
Very happy with this product.  It arrived in record time and the tapes work well with my VCR's. Would recommend to otheres that are still using VCR's.,positive,None
I like to tape a lot on my vcr and this is a quite reliable product.  I will continue to purchase these.,positive,None
These VHS tapes are good but after I got them I realized that I needed more time but this was no fault of the Manufacturer and since they are no longer available it does not matter now.I have found them at another website with more hours.

These are wonderful for recording anything you like if you still have a VCR!  I will use them and order more!,positive,None
"If you still use blank VHS VCs like I do, this three pack is really handy. I know that most of us are using DVDs now, but I still find a use at times for an eight or nine hour VC and this fills the bill. This tape stands up pretty well to being used over and over and I would surely suggested it if tape is what you need.",positive,None
"These tapes are oustanding. Brillant picture. No tracking problems. I used to buy another name brand 8 hour, to many tracking problems. First time buyer for Maxell very happy with the product excellent price and quality.Believe me I have gone through tapes since VCR;s first came out still have the original GE VCR. Cannot go wrong with the Maxell.",positive,None
I gave these tapes an OK rating because they were OK for recording only one time on them but if you had to re-record on them they were no good and unfortunately I found this out the hard way. I would only recommend  these tapes to someone who is only going to use them one time.,neutral,None
"Great product that performs exactly as needed.  Great look to it and could not be more pleased.

"I use these at work, and the sound is great and the cord frees me from my desk.  (I often have to travel around the building.)  I work with computers andI wasn't sure how it would work with all of the electrically noisy  equipment around us but it works great!  Highly recommended!",positive,None
"Fine sound, good reception over a decent range (looks like I can get around the yard without them making any big complaints), comfortable.I would say that the fidelity is only slightly less than the earbuds I'm used to.  And the separation is better than I expected.  There is a fair amount of hiss if no music is on, but I'm pretty picky and I think its totally tolerable.",positive,None
"Overall very pleased with the product. The phones are lightweight, comfortable, and the sound quality is good anywhere in our house &amp; yard. The quality of construction of the phones and the base unit is good. There is an ample supply of cables &amp; adapters, i.e., for plugging into  a computer soundcard.",positive,None
"Used it as directed on a polkaudio cd player, and it did not improve the machine.  Cannot say for sure that the product didn't work, or the machine is just broken.  Machine started to not recognize certain cds that it played before.  Using the cleaner did not improve the machines performance.",neutral,None
"Works very well.  Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem.  Easy to follow audio directions.",positive,None
"This product is a wast of money,it is not thing but a cd disc with some soft brushes on it for to spinning around trying to clean the cd player laser eye and this cd disc thing can't clean the laser eye at all.Most portable cd player this day are lid open anyway.You properly can clean the laser eye with a cotton swab with a dip of a little rubbing alcohol.That what I used this product for.",negative,None
"Dont waste the money.Used multiple times on two different units, did NOTHING to either......DON'T BOTHER.",negative,None
I thought my expensive old Sony CD player was finished - it skipped and sound was not as good.  Allsop restored the player to original good quality.  I highly recommend this product.,positive,None
"I can't say with any certainty that it's the end all laser cleaner. It's ingeneous approach does seem clever though. Consumers buy this product when their CD player starts skipping. I did too. If you're  lucky enough that the problem is a dirty laser, you're in luck. One cannot expect this humble product to fix a mechanical or lubrication problem. Good luck, it's definitely worth a try.",positive,None
"THIS CD CLEANER HAS MORE BRUSHES TO DO A LITTLE MORE CLEANING TO A CD PLAYER, BUT IT'S NOT ADVANCED ENOUGH FOR A CAR CD PLAYER.",positive,None
"Over the course of the last few months my CD player had gone from the occasional skip to eventually not being able to play a CD at all. 5 minutes after my package arrived with this CD cleaner in it and I was playing CDs again. I can also play CDRs now, something my stereo hasn't been able to do for six months.",positive,None
I purchased item for my PC/laptop/boombox/DVD player.Just for maintenance to keep eye lens clear of any dirt/dust after using it on all of 3-5 items their was a coat of dust/dirt on disc.WOW what a surprise I try to keep my electronics clean  & dust free every 2-3 months but dust/dirt seem to find it's way inside electronics.,positive,None
"This product really does make a difference.  I had an older CD player that was doing a lot of skipping, and sometimes it would not function at all.  I ran the cleaning disc through it once, and now it's working just fine.  Great item to have around even if you only need to use it once a year... certainly beats having to buy a new CD or DVD player!",positive,None
I have only used it once and it cleared the skipping problem. It has an interesting method to the way it works by playing a piece of classical music while the lens cleaner cleans the lens.,positive,None
Tried this on our 2004 Toyota Highlander. The CD player wouldn't even read the disk. Tried several times. Don't waste your money.,negative,None
"Can't say enough good things about this. It took less than a minute to clean my very dirty car CD player. I was shocked that it worked so fast ! Just listen to the voice and switch to track 3, then after the music on the cleaning disk stops, remove the disk and your done. Unless they came out with a better product, I don't know why they stopped selling this one !",positive,None
My professional CD players have always performed well.  They are &#34;broadcast quality&#34; units and it is just not acceptable to have them skip or not read a disc.  One of my players recently began to do just that and I was hoping to just get the lens cleaned with a laser-lens cleaner.  This particular product did the job and so far the unit reads better and does not skip anymore.,positive,None
"This laser-lens cleaner works well for what we intended to use it for, it helps to eliminate dust from our CDs.",positive,None
"These are good cd cleaning wipes for cleaning fingerprints, stain, and other marks on a cd to avoid going to a dvd store to get it cleaned. Good additions for cd protections.",positive,None
I USED THIS ON A DISK I WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH. AFTER I USED THIS THE DISK PLAYED FINE.THE INSTRUCTIONS TOLD ME TO WIPE ON THE SIDE WITH NO PRINTING. I WAS ALWAYS WIPING ON TOP.,positive,None
I down load a lot of CD's and need to keep them nice and clean. I will use these wisely and keep all my music cd's clean from finger prints and dust. Thank you so much. Beverly,positive,None
Had old movies that we were unable to view because they kept skipping. Gave them a good cleaning and all were view able.,positive,None
I have a Netflix subscription and receive DVDs in the mail. There are a high number of these discs that have scratches and smudges on them. Rather than send it back because it won't play correctly I give them a quick wipe with these cloths and have had success with almost every DVD.,positive,None
There is really not much you can say about a clean wipe. The product does clean fingerprints on the DVD. I'm very satisfied with the product. If it had come with a small bottle of a cleaning solution it would be even better.,positive,None
You can use a clean piece of cloth to clean your disk.  It did not remove the scratches from my disk.  Waste of money.,negative,None
"Pretty simple product.  There are about 30 or so sheets in a package. Take one out and wipe in a circular motion.  Gets rid of the smudges and makes the disc shine.  However, if your kids touch it with grimy fingers it will struggle to remove those types of stains.",positive,None
"These are indespenisible around our house. Out grandchilden find then and play with them.  I've witnessed them trying to get our wee dog, Nola, to catch as one would catch a frisbee.  Thankully, we have only totally lost a few CD's.  Easily replacable!",positive,None
I use these wipes all the times on my electronics. They are lintless and have many uses besides wiping clean CDs and DVDs. I use them from time to time to clean VCR heads too. I just cut a small section and saturate it in alcohol. It works a treat. I highly recommend them.,positive,None
"Very handy. And reusable. well, .....now I have to provide more words.... Handy, handy, handy! I just need to remember to use, especially on RENTAL DVDs.",positive,None
This was the first time I have used such a product and was pleased with the results.  Works great for a fast clean before playing,positive,None
I got these to clean dirty DVD and Bluerays that I got from Netflix. Works great. Saves a lot of frustration when a movie stops or skips because of crud on the disk.,positive,None
"I use these to clean every movie I receive from Netflix. I repurchase these wipes every couple of months to clean rented Blu-Ray movies, Wii, and PS3 games. I prefer to see the dirt I'm removing. Make sure you wipe back and forth, away and towards the center of the disc, instead of wiping in circles, as stated in the directions.",positive,None
"I just needed a product to quickly wipe down my rented movies, or used DVDs and CDs I purchase online or at garage sales, etc. So far it appears to work well.  Nice price.",positive,None
Good price but they don't work as good as a mild detergent and warm water.  These still leave fingerprints on the disc.  Good for a quick wipe but not a through cleaning.,positive,None
these wipes did get the job done but the fabric doesn't hold up long but for a quick cleaning its good just to have around when u are on the go...,neutral,None
I have looking around for this item for some time. I had some trouble fined them. It work really good.,positive,None
"At first I thought it was little bit expensive price, but when I get it and use it, it is not, definately worth the money.This CD & DVD wipes really cleans. The wipes is good quality cleaning materials, cleans the dirts and finger prints off the DVDs very well.I definately recommend to give this a try, worth your money, it does the job good. Thanks Amazon!",positive,None
"I had a DVD that kept on not playing every other disc l got from Netflix. It would say the disc was dirty or scratched. I gave any one that didn't play a good clean with these wipes but rearly got any to work. Maybe if you had dusty CD's but l never got any sense that this was ""cleaning"". More of a light polish. Didn't work for me.",negative,None
Did not clean my cds as good as it says. they were still scatched.  would not recommend this products to anyone,negative,None
DVD Fastwipes clean my cd's and dvd's and make them extremely clean it wipes of dust and dirt and does a great job!,positive,None
I have purchased many of these Belkin Velcro Cable ties over the past few years. They are well made and very useful.,positive,None
"I love these things, in fact I use them in my backpack to manage the cables I travel with. Power adapters for tablets, phones, chargers and computers, with all that i carry a bunch of cables. so its nice to have these!",positive,None
"If you have cords that you want to identify or cords that you need to pack away then these are excellent.  I use them on my laptop power cords, headphone cords, etc.",positive,None
My stereo system was a jungle of wires once i used these cable times I tamed that jungle.  I love that I can remove the cables that I no longer need and add new cables without cutting cable ties.,positive,None
These work and look exactly as expected.  Easy to use.  What more can I say about Velcro strips? Evidently I need to say more to meet the minimum word requirement to post this review.,positive,None
This are great. They are high quality. Nothing more to say really except that they work. I use it for all the cables on my computer.,positive,None
"Cable ties works as they are promised to. Was able to organize the cables behind the TV, looks much better. Preferred to use these over the smaller ties, the larger velcro straps allow multiple larger cables to be bundled together.",positive,None
They work as I expected they would without too much extra material left over and here are my last words.,positive,None
"Quick, reusable, and color coded... these velco cable ties are a fast and effective way to cable management.  Easy and reusable, unlike zipties.",positive,None
"i definitely prefer the radio shack ties because you can adjust the tie to the size of the tie to the cable, and the whole strip is velcro so no extra cable hangs off of the bundle.  but these are a little cheaper and work most of the time too.",neutral,None
"Good Product and different colors come in handy for using a certain color for a specific device, they are priced right so like me I bought 5 packs that way I have 5 ties of the same color.",positive,None
"These are OK for wrapping cables behind your desk or something like that, but they do not attach to cables.  If you are putting them on cables that you wrap and unwrap on a regular basis these are not so good.  Seemed to be designed for semi permanent installations, not for daily work",neutral,None
"For no more than they cost, I would recommend these to everyone. Yes the colors are rather primary and boring, but they are dirt cheap and have withstood daily use and abuse.These travel around in my flight case and camera bags all the time and still work great. I'm ordering more as soon as I finish typing this review.  Seriously, stop reading and just buy them already!",positive,None
"These were purchased as an &#34;add on&#34; item and must say that they fit the bill in our house.  We use them as a tie on the cords for equipment that we move around the house.  Easy to wrap and unwrap.  Thanks, Amazon!",positive,None
As someone with far to many computers anything that helps me tame the mess of wires is welcome.  this fit the bill well and I like the tab that makes them easy to remove.,positive,None
"These are great. That the hooks of the velcro only occupy a small strip on the band isn't a big deal. They hold well, they're colorful, and good quality. My strips from eight years ago still work.",positive,None
"I use these every day for keeping cords neat since I have a lot of computer equipment, ipad accessories, power cords, etc.",positive,None
"These little cable ties may not be of the highest quality, but they do work, and you sure get a great deal considering the price.There is only Velcro on part of the strip, so I don't know how long the tie would last if  you were tying and untying it all the time.  What I have found, is that if I just tie something up and leave the cable types alone, these work great.I am happy with them.",positive,None
"I travel with cpap machine and this works great for my hose, power cord and extension cord. Highly recommended, A+++",positive,None
I use these all the time to organize my cables and power cords. They are long enough to do a great job (nlike some that are too short to wrap the entire cable).I recommend them.,positive,None
"This is cool and all, but I was a little upset when I found out I could buy it at the dollar store for about half the price.",positive,None
"I have been using these for a few years as I use Belkin A/V Pure cables a lot. The colored ones are nice, think I will use them to color code cables.",positive,None
A simple little product that is a great help in keeping control cords used on a video jib. I like having them in various colors so as to be able to keep track better of several different cords. These are well made.,positive,None
"I love this things. I use them to keep wires contained and out of the way, and I use them to keep things organized and handy. They can be reused over and over, and the colors help to organize and mark things.",positive,None
They are simple and easy to use.  The eight inch length will wrap around a fairly large bundle.  I bought  them to use on earbud cables and charger cables for which I trim them to about 3 inches in length.,positive,None
"Strong velcro grip, long enough to wrap a bunch of cables together, short enough to still be convenient when just wrapping one.  Good product.",positive,None
I hate having long cords gather up in a pile and look ugly. These ties do the job and make it look more organized.,positive,None
"Performs as expected from any cable tie. I like that it's Velcro and reusable unlike the stiff plastic ties. I used it to clean up the wires under my desk in my tiny cubicle at work, so that I'm not constantly kicking or stepping on wires.",positive,None
Belkin has never let me down.  I had order 2 of these packages and used them all - and am ordering more.  I'm also ordering a longer length version.,positive,None
"It;s so much easier to wrap a long cord and put a velcro tie to hold the cable in a shorter,bundle than having several feet of all the cords.",positive,None
"They were only a buck as an add on item and work as expected. Honestly, it's easier to use a small plastic rubber band if it's a cord you're going to constantly use...",neutral,None
"Boo, hiss, buy the 50 count one in my other review. For some reason these are short and they are not designed to stay on a cable like the other ones I reviewed.",negative,None
I was looking for Velcro ties that had the loop that i could slide the many iPad/iPhone cables i carry through. These ties will keep your cables bundled individually but i would prefer an additional loop or eye for the cable than i would wrap the excess around.,negative,None
"I've been using these allot latley and these work great! Don't tear or come apart and the velcro is enough for office use. NOT recomended for giging musicians or roadies, these are not strong enough for road use but great in the office.",positive,None
"Short, sweet, and colorful. Everything you could want in velcro ties. =]I'm not sure how else to rate these. They're as advertised. For me, it was hard to find short sizes, and they were close enough. The colors are an added bonus. They are high-quality, sturdy, and lock together well.",positive,None
"I love the fact that they work well, don't separate and can hold alot of cords at the same tome.  My husband hates seeing cables all mess - I always have a spare set for him.  All the cables are color coordinated at are place and these are the reason why",positive,None
"This product is very good: high quality, good service, and fast ship. It is sutable with my think before I got it.",positive,None
these work for just about anything that you might need them for.  there are only six in the package so you don't get very many.,positive,None
If you are looking for something to bundle your cords together or if you have mess behind your TV and/or computer I would suggest these to help you get the cords organized.,positive,None
Fine little Velcro ties. The ties lack a tie to the cable (I use them for extension cords). If they had a small slot to double them back through it in order to fasten them to the cable then I would rate 5 stars.,positive,None
theres Belkin Velcro Cable Ties (8 Inch) are excellent.  with the color pattern i am able to label both ends of my cables making it a cinch to locate the one I'm looking for.  all of my cables are bound together with the monster cable management system also sold on amazon,positive,None
Needed some wire wraps (instead of wire ties) to keep my bass guitar amp power cord and equipment cord(s) in place while not in use. I tried some other brands and was more of a &#34;pain&#34; than help. Seen this at Amazon and it couldn't work better. Easy to put on and easy to remove and keeps the cables nicely tied when needed. Get price too even if it is an &#34;Add-On Item&#34;. Thanks : ),positive,None
Don't spend a lot of money.  Buy these easy to use velcro cable tie wraps that allow you to use and reuse over and over again  Comes in multiple color pack (for that color coding you want to do).  Remember these aren't just for cables.  I've used them to hold shelves together for extra support!  These really stay stuck together!  I've chained a few together for a bigger project I needed help together.  A must have in any household.,positive,None
"I carry these in my tool box and found them handy to use, especaily with the different colors to chose.  I have used them to temporarily hold something in place while I am trying to drill it in place.  I have even connected severl together for larger items.",positive,None
"These ties are perfect for managing cords. I like that they are reusable and can color-code your electronics. I use the colors based on sound cords. For example: black/silver for HDMI and red/green/blue for composite.I would recommend getting two packages though, you'll probably need more than you think.",positive,None
"One inch of the eight is the name tag (belkin), another inch is the hook portion of Velcro.  If there is any movement in the cable bundle you wrapped, it all comes undone, (except that 1"" of Valcro) What a waste of money. Buy something else, I am having to.",negative,None
"Great wire ties.  Easy to use, release and reuse. The colors make it easy to identify different cords. Highly recommend.",positive,None
"well, they are velco so they work. they do get lost easily though, kind of wish i had bought a different kind....",neutral,None
"Umm...seriously? $1.63 for these? These cable ties are really good quality, have a nice long strap with a tight velcro to secure them all. Different colors makes it easier (kind of) to keep things organized, but at the very least it adds a bit of color to the jungle of cables you have.",positive,None
I don't have much to compare these to except for the heavy duty version that I use for power cables and extension cords in the garage. These are obviously light duty. Works great for computer and game cables. They are atrong enough to hold my Hdmi switch box strapped to the pole of my computer desk to make it easily accessible.,positive,None
It is Belkin product so it is of high quality.It does the job it was marketed for.I would recommend purchasing the cable ties.,neutral,None
You can never have enough Velcro cable ties.  I use them for everything.  I also have plenty around. Never know when you need one.,positive,None
"green ones for hard drive, red ones for DVD-drive, ... blue cable tie to help with fans and wires.Worth every cent.  Every pc enthusiast should have some sort of advanced cable-tie system in place.",positive,None
These ties are great for something you repeatedly bundle and unbundle like a laptop power cord.  They're slightly expensive per strap but are worth it in my opinion.,positive,None
"You can buy the same thing at the dollar store. Save yourself the five dollars, but if you want color coding, this will work well for quick visual ID.",positive,None
"I'll never understand why re-useable cable ties are so expensive, or so unavailable.  These Belkins are really for permanent stereo or computer installation.  And even for that purpose, I don't care for their design.If you are a musician looking to tie up microphone, speaker or instrument cables, these are not suitable.",negative,None
"Easy to use, I needed them to organize all the cables in my desk, they work but I would rather to get the 6 of them in one single color.",neutral,None
"These are so much better than using zip-ties!n They're easy to see, and - more important - much easier to remove! How many times have you needed to remove a zip-tie and you had to find something sharp, then hope you didn't cut through whatever you had bundled together?! These are great for the job!",positive,None
"Nice for small cable bundling, but not enough Velcro for large bundles.Works great in computer cases for cable dressing.",positive,None
Easy to use velcro fasteners to keep wiring tidy and neat with a belkin labeled pull take to easy undo the fastener. It works.,positive,None
"I use these to hold my kitchen appliance cords.  They work great, I use to use twist ties, which worked, but these are just so much nicer.  The entire strip is velcro and then the one end has the sticky part.  They come in multi colors.",positive,None
"They're little velcro straps.  Not much to say here, they work exactly as you'd think they would and do a great job of keeping cables organized.",positive,None
"If you've got any devices that have cables, this is the best system for keeping the cables controlled.  Whether you're traveling or simply want to gather cables together so they're not hanging or lying all over the place, these &#34;ties&#34; do the job.",positive,None
"those are exceptionally well made. I used &#34;cheapo&#34;-products before but these are really nice quality and come with a sling on one end that allow you to slide it onto a wire, provided the plug on either side is not too large, so it does not fall off when untied.",positive,None
the whole tie Velcro to  it self only at the end of it is there the opposite type of Velcro.,negative,None
This is just a high speed USB cable and is of Belkin's normal good quality.  It does what it is suppose to do and the price is excellent.,positive,None

I have been using this cable with my Samsung Laster printer for over 2 years now and couldn't be happier with the no problem performance.Its long enough to be used as a printer cable (which is important) and it works.

Please price this Belkin USB Pro Series 2.0 cable at your local office supply store.  I did.  It is over $20.00.  Another amazing Amazon deal. We have three in use.  Stocking up on a couple of extra at $4.95 each with free shipping is a good idea.  Quality printer cables will only increase in the future.  And the hits just keep on coming.,positive,None

I really like Belkin products and this cord works great from my pc to the printer and could not ask for it to do more,positive,None

Basically needed a longer cord for my USB hub. The stock cable that came with it was SO short. Didn't want to spend a ton of $$ but still needed something with good connectors and decent speed. This did the job without breaking the bank.Would recommend!,positive,None
Extremely low price at a high quality made. The cost of it is only a small fraction of any cables price at stores.,positive,None

great does whats described sorry cant think of anything else to say except I hate that we have to do this in twenty or more words totally excessive,positive,None
"It's an extension. Kind of hard to say more than that. It's a Belkin cable, so it's good quality. The ends have molded strain reliefs. This is a USB 1.1 cable, however, so data transfer speeds will be slower. But if you are using it only to charge something, it won't affect it.",positive,None
"Instead of the pictured Belkin cable, I got a flimsy generic cable.  Total and complete rip off.",negative,None

I have no complaints pertaining to this cable.  I particularly like the molded connector feature.
