good little set of add on lenses didn't really get the chance to use much but they all seemed to work fine just stepped up to the Nikon D3200 package so gave this one to my wife,neutral
"I had one from 2 years ago, also cheaply made blue plastic, which transferred my pictures very quickly.  I gave that to a relative, and bought ths one, from &#34;jacob's parts&#34;.  It's much slower, although made of similar cheap blue plastic.  I can tolerate the cheap feel, but 45 min to transfer 1 sd card worth of pix when it used to take much less than 30 is not ok, even at this two buck price!",neutral
Nice bag that I got for free when I purchased the K200D Body. Just wondering what to do with the velcro padded partitions that don't seem to fit anywhere. Would have been nice to have some illustrations. Quality I would rate a 4. Lots of pockets and Compartments. Just a bit larger than I expected.,neutral
This case is OK but it feels somewhat cheap and flimsy. You have to be careful when standing up the iPad vertically as it may flip.,neutral
"Purchased this item in hopes of increasing my range over my Linksys adapter, but it hasn't.  It works fine up to about 40 feet, then you lose your connection quite often.  I will use it, but it doesn't do what I expected.",neutral
Well what can I say about a case.... It's good with one side to hold USB cable and memory card with a net and the External Hard Drive on the other side. The material is quite sturdy and resembles Nylon on Tumi products. And cute Amazon logo on the Zipper ^^,neutral
"Technically I'm sure this is a fine product. My college professor suggested using a Trackball instead of a mouse for Photoshop work, but after ordering this and trying it out for awhile, I went back to the mouse. This was too clunky and big for my smaller hand and I was very uncomfortable using it.",neutral
"It does it's job, but very hard to apply.  I finally learned to live with the air bubbles under the ""skin"" after trying many times to get it on correctly.It probably is a good - better product, but I had a hard time trying to get it applied correctly.",neutral
I am not sure how long a keyboard is expected to last under daily use but I have not had this all that long and it is starting to die already. The keys are no longer functioning all the time. I bought it because of the good reviews but I think I will try a different keyboard next time.,neutral
"It can be forced into place to make the product fit, but it is too tight for my radio and required a little modification to make it look good.  I also painted mine to improve the look.",neutral
This is the 2nd one of these that I've bought because the other one broke shortly after receiving it.  This one seems to be lasting a bit longer.  Caution on these.  You get what you pay for.,neutral
"I used this mouse for several months, but I finally came to the conclusion that it is simply too small.  Perhaps for someone with smaller hands that won't be a problem.  I also don't like the fact that it uses AAA batteries (related to the fact that it's quite small).My new replacement Bluetooth mouse uses AA batteries, which are much more common, and therefore easier (and often cheaper) to replace.  Especially when traveling.",neutral
"The Case is really nice but the pockets are not so comfortable. If u have all the kit sensor, even the wifi USB, you can risk to loose it easily. An extra zip inside will be ok. It strange that GARMIN doesn't think on it before.",neutral
"These headphones perform wonderfully, especially considering their low price. I have listened to rock, pop, country, and classical music, and these phones have sounded great in all genres. However, after extended wear, they began to cause me outer ear pain where my ear touched the interior part of the headphone. I have since switched my primary headphones to the Sennheiser PX100.",neutral
"I appreciate the higher voltage needed to charge tablets, like the iPad, which has a bigger power draw than traditional smartphones. However, over time, I noticed that the charger doesn't hold up. The seam that connects the front plate to the back plate split apart and the construction quality could be better.",neutral
"These wipes leave my iPhone/Kindle Fire/iPad2 clean as a whistle.  No more fingerprints, smudges, or gunk.  I also assume they are sanitizing my device.  Overall these are a good buy.The only downside is their size.  These wipes are well smaller than a dollar bill.  With only 15 wipes per pack, if you are cleaning bigger items (iPad for example), you will go through these in a hurry.",neutral
Sony comes out with great products but making this system exclusive just for Sony 4K Tv's is just pure greed. I had it for about 3 weeks and sold it.,neutral
"I am happy with it, I fell I got my money's worth. I think the next generation could be refined though. When I am in the shower I want to change the volume, I sometimes turn it off instead of up or down because it hard to tell which button is which.",neutral
"The price isn't amazing, it's not a rip off either though.They function just as they should. Therefore, &#34;just okay.&#34;",neutral
I purchased this to replace one going bad after 2 years this replacement lasted about 3 month before it went bad back to HP Warranty,neutral
I like the semi hard case but not the cheap velcro straps that you have to use to store your camera safely in this thing. A simple pocket would have been a nicer solution but it'll do for now..... at least it was cheap!,neutral
not truly wireless as they connect the the wall outlet plus are wired to one another. the sound is good but not great.,neutral
"Gave as a gift. It wasn't very pleasing to the recipient - my mistake. I thought it would clean glasses, but instead they will have to use it for just jewelry which was very welcome",neutral
I bought this because I need a 90deg plug like in the picture but the product I received was not like the picture the plug was straight.other then that it works as intended.,neutral
can't mount where I need them but they work good as cameras the low light function is fantastic but also the weak point for the motion sense. To prevent false motion sensing I have to set the sensitivity level too low,neutral
"It's okay, took a chance and now it's in the drawer.  Kind of a pain to use, there have got to be better ones out there.",neutral
"The router works ok, but I had bought this to replace the previous two routers that were not doing the job and sadly this router did not provide the strong signal I was looking for.",neutral
"Haven't tried this out yet because I didn't realize it would be so big.  However, it does look very well-made.",neutral
"clean sound, great range, goes through walls, bass is really bad. overall sound quality is ok but i expected better for the price",neutral
I use this to charge a Samsung S3 and it takes about 4-5 hours to be fully charged which is 2x longer than when I use a blackerry OEM cord but it's still better than the samsung cord that came with phone.,neutral
"It's okay, the technology is old so there is not much we can do. As the memory it self it does works and do some performance improvements for my Dell Dimension 3000.",neutral
I hated that they stuck so much out of my ears. When lifting weights I felt like they kept falling out. This is just my personal opinion about them. But I did like the red cord (kind of like dre beats) and they were very loud.,neutral
"I maybe should have bought a knock off, however it works and looks great. Be sure and buy the extra battery (I forgot)",neutral
I have no cloo what is or isn't special about this cable.  It is still sitting in the box but from past experience the price is excellent and i'm sure the quality of picture will be too,neutral
"Don't like this case much, it doesnt fit my camera very well.  It's too deep for most larger cameras so my camera flops around a bit.  It's also fairly bulky and you wouldn't want this thing attached to your belt.  For $6 it does what is was designed for.",neutral
"I bought this originally for an iPod touch and iPad 2... works for those, recently purchased an iPhone 4s and the iphone doesn't recognize that there is an external power source.  Swapped cables for one that I do know works on the 4s, same issue...  same charger and cable works with the ipod touch.  curious",neutral
"Nothing great, but will do a little better than Apple stock ones.",neutral
"With good program quality the 3D effect is very good. However, it is like viewing television through dark sunglasses so if the program content is dark the picture quality is poor. A film like ""Up"" is good but the ""Dark Knight"" isn't. Where 3D really shines is sports like the NBA playoffs. However, this is a relitively cheap price for an emerging technology that will someday be more than high tech toy.",neutral
"Emits a high-frequency buzz, backlights (except for the 3 buttons that you really need) activate every time you look in the general direction of the remote.  Fit and feel is quite crude and unpleasant.  This is simply not an elegant remote.  Pre-programming is almost impossible; you are much better off using the training feature.",neutral
I bought this to eliminate my alternator whining problem... it doesn't. Although it does suppressthe sound slightly but if you turn up your system you can still hear it..,neutral
"I purchased this with the EA 3500 wireless router and both products said they provided QoS.  While you can manage QoS on the router, this product has no way of managing QoS so I am not sure how they are really providing QoS.  There is no documentation on what their stock QoS priorities are.  In the future I will buy a managed switch.",neutral
"Like others have said, this is only a 10 gauge power wire - maybe. I ended up using my existing 10 gauge power wire I was looking to upgrade because it was a larger diameter than what came here. I kept the kit and gave it 3 stars because just using the fuse block and a couple of the miscellaneous wires would have been $10-$12 separately.",neutral
"I was hoping this device would help me recover the data on my laptop's hard disk.  Unfortunately, the disk is not compatible.  Take away: be sure you verify what you hard disk is compatible before buying this product.",neutral
"I got these for my 5-year-old son. I paid $30 and got what I paid for. The construction quality is fairly high. Sound quality is good. If you are not looking to spend a lot of money on nicer head phones that are really over-priced because of the logo on the side, then these will do well for you.",neutral
"its a simple product for every single camera out there, easy to use and also very usefull. if you looking to buy just something than can hold your camera stand still and let you regulate the lavel, this product is for you.",neutral
These work great but I can't figure out for the life of me why they decided to put the volume control mid-cord? It flops around so I can only use these when I have something on that I can clip it too (like when I'm biking or running with a camel pack).,neutral
these batteries are not as good as they said. but they can hold a charge for a while and do the job.,neutral
"I put it on my IPad 4 and sticks good , but the problem was that it does not show you the original screen like when you don't have a a screen protector, it has Bearly unseen dots ,, you won't see the difference unless you compare it to unbothered IPad without screen protectorWhen sow the difference I took it off immediately , all in all it is not that bad but not that good either",neutral
I expected more from Klipsch than this. I feel like the music is tinny and lifeless.  I like my $50 skull candy earbuds much better.  I do not feel these are much better (maybe a little) than the free ones included with most ipods.  Sorry guys.,neutral
Normal headphones for the computer. Without special claims for quality of sound. I use them only for Skype. Not for music!,neutral
"This was a good case. Not phenomenal or awesome, but acceptable. I didn't want bulk since it's a tablet and already bulky enough, but I wanted to be able to put it down without scratching anything.The cover flap had become very slightly bent over the time, most likely because of the way it props up the tablet.This does not very effectively prop up the tablet.",neutral
"its o.k but the Microsoft Lifecam X3000 is much better, i own both.. better images, faster tracking and it has some real nice features and it's $19.99 AR",neutral
"Purchased 3 spools; the price for Sony disks was unbeatable, but so far I have had 4 disks that have a flaw on the edge and I just opened the spool.  You can record on them but they will not play back.  Will have to inspect/review each disk before recording now, and I shouldn't have to do that.  Expected better from Sony.",neutral
Nice product but you are required to pay $15.00 a month to get music and it did not say that in the description when I bought this as a gift.,neutral
I would of rated it higher had I actually gotten the product.,neutral
"it didn't fit my 7 inch HD quite right and felt like it was too big. It's cute, and I am sure a very sturdy product, but I can't use it without fear of my kindle falling out.  It could just be me",neutral
"good quality , good finish but i bought it for my canon sx30i which already has a wide angel lens , i thought it will ad a lot but actually it didnt add anythingpicture without it is better",neutral
The case was very tight with the iPad mini it. I can't fit my iPad in it with the smart case on which is surprising because it's a very thin case. They need to make the case slightly larger. The case also had a very slight oder to it but went away within a day.,neutral
My title says it all. These are good headphones with good sound quality. Noise cancelling is there but not enough. I am not sure how these would compare with a Bose for example.Headphones are not padded and they can begin to hurt the head if worn for too long.,neutral
Was really looking for a good screen protector for the kindle fire.  This one is a perfect fit and goes on very easily but I could not get all the air bubbles out.  I spent quite a bit of time working on this but finally just gave up as it was not working.  So this is an ok product and works great to protect the screen if you dont mind bubbles.,neutral
I should have got the battery powered on I had last deployment. Its nice at work but I'd rather have the battery powered one.,neutral
"I picked this bag because it measured 7 inches long (in the product listing).  My Canon XA10 camcorder just barely fits inside. The additional side pouches holds the XA10's battery, USB cable, audio/video cables, and the A/C power adapter.  I wish they could have made this bag just a little bit bigger! Just by one more inch longer and wider, and 3 inches taller.  This bag is better suited for cameras, NOT camcorders!",neutral
"It's a decent light. The neck is floppy and does not want to stay where you put it. I find it annoying to touch the power switch 3 times to turn it off. It doesn't have a physical &#34;clicky&#34; button, just a touch switch.",neutral
"I bought this to use it in my psychology internship and it does work but this is slow as hell, I get desperate trying to open a program and it is the same with the internet. If you don't have patience (just like me) don't get into this. At least I can say that at the end it gets the job done (but way at the end).",neutral
"We got reasonable value for our money.  It works.  The price was okay.  Software is a bit obtuse.  However, it always does the automatic backups and files are available when we need them.  Far better than the mechanical external hard disk it replaced.  I definitely recommend going solid state.",neutral
"The price was good and it arrived on time. It comes with a remote so you can use the tablet almost as a TV. Aside from that, most people will not find a use for it.KenWebmaster[...]",neutral
"Power adapter AC plug easily get break( one of the prong left in the AC wall ),but the device itself is working fine.",neutral
"As others have pointed out, this type of lens hood (Fotodiox) does NOT work with ultra-wide screen camera model (e.g. HDR-CX550v) at the widest zoom.  However, I have found one that works perfectly with the CX550v on Ebay (seller: Rainbowimaging). This metal lens hood works great for my cam and the price is pretty cheap. I'd recommend you check that out.",neutral
"They work as long as you add your own adhesive to the back or the wires aren't heavy. I used these to dress an AV rack and some fell off after a few days. Some glue fixed that. For the price if you don't mind adding some glue in the mix, they're worth it. These things are a lot more expensive in the store.",neutral
"I bought it because it supports many types of formats. It is not very responsive and if you break your remote, you can not use it. I can not seem to find information on the largest hdd it supports. It is ok, Would be better if it worked faster and the remote needs a redesign.",neutral
"They aren't silver, they are orange purple and gray. Also they have horrible mids and the bass is muddy",neutral
"The pen is great. But the touch function are not, it is hard to use touch as the others on laptop. So, I recommend to buy Bamboo Pen not this one.Also the latest driver is incompatible with my tablet pc's screen.",neutral
Good for value.  Hope to never use it.  Received information online vs as actual paper document.  Don't know if I like that,neutral
"It works well if left alone, but this is not a screw on hood, its a 2 sided push-in.If you accidentally touch 1 side, the hood could just fall off, either getting lost or making a disturbing noise on a hard floor when quiet is needed.",neutral
"It is a good bag, looks good, but it is on the small side (which it's intended to be), and the handle is a bit rickety.  I know it's not meant for rugged use, but just back and forth to the car and office it has had some use but seems to not be holding up that well (the wheels and handle).  I switch bags often enough though that that's not a big deal for me.",neutral
"Big in your hands, so if you wear a size medium in gloves, this may not fit.Connecting to my 8-core was simple. Works well. Fast. Smooth.It's the shape that kinda bothers me. Unless you point your mouse straight forward, the orientation of the curvy design is a little off.I would recommend you try this in a store before buying online.",neutral
"We've purchased this item in the past and it worked great.  I went to get a second and the second one the charging contact pin was broken.  The vendor honored a return request, but I was disappointed that it did not work.",neutral
"My goal was to have a silent PC, I use an Antec P180 case, and replaced the stock fan. Unfortunately, I can still hear a very audible hum from them .. disappointing.My search for a quieter fan continues ...",neutral
"Like some have said, not as comfortable as the OEM. Who knows with music (head cold, wife left you, fired) but, they seem to muffle the sound a bit. Better than before however.",neutral
"Exactly what it says it is, nothing more, nothing less.While a Class 10, it's speed is more like class 5.Recommended.  I would buy another if I had a need for one.",neutral
"Bought this for my new rig. First 4 months, product had no issues. A few weeks ago, I kept getting high pings in online games (3x+ usual ping).",neutral
"Camera works OK most of the time. Sometimes it stops recording anything until you reformat the card to clear it. Video is good, but not at night. IR LED's will not give enough light for anything useful.",neutral
I found good reviews about it and bought itBut found its not that greatreason I did not like- auto focus is not quick to focus- you really need stable hands else it does not give sharp image^ i have found this to be a huge problem,neutral
"""the TD2220 supports the USB HID Touch driver and is fully compatible with Windows 8""Not so.  As noted elsewhere you cannot swipe from the bezel onto the screen thus limiting the usefulness of this monitor for Windows 8.It would be a great monitor for Windows 7.",neutral
"Im okay with this , the only con is that it dosent mirror every connection, maybe its my cell, but overall it dose the job",neutral
"I still have not mastered the knack of bubble free installation, even though I've looked at various you tube videos, and tried really hard. Oh well, the product itself was fine, ease of application not good for me.",neutral
Just ordered it. Just waiting for it to come. will update then. Bought it for my son and to use when on a cruise ship. should be fun. will update the star rating at that time too.,neutral
"I'd highly recommend you get the sandisk ultra series for microsd,so you can actually record in 1080p hd and all that for your phone if you're using that with this product.",neutral
The weather band reception is so terribly weak it really does not work at all.Other than that the light is OK but really does not produce much light.Just OK for $20 bucks.Note that it does have an 12 V AC adapter input for internal battery recharging.The 3.5 mm plug is for audio input ONLY and does not power speakers or headphones.Note that any special necessary cable for audio input or 12 V AC adapter are not included.,neutral
"I tried this with my 5d2 with 24-70. It works well, but it has slight creeping problem. it will never stay where you line it up before tightening. The plastic between the camera and the ball head is too flimsy, you can even do a significant wiggle and see the difference.I will keep this for a future gorilla pod+flash combo",neutral
"I have a new HP 15.6"" Laptop. The 1360us.  Esresso Color.Thus it amazes me that HP markets this bag to fit up to 16"" and it BARELY fits my 15.6"".  My Brothers older HP fit perfectly, however this bag is to match the newer styled laptops, so why wouldn't it fit them correctly?Its nice looking, and good quality, but the fit scares me.  I wonder how many people with 16"" laptops have gotten this and realized it didn't fit.",neutral
"Not much to say about it except that it works.  I use it as a storage unit, and backup for three of my computers.  The large capacity is exactly what I was looking for, and this device fills the bill.",neutral
"9 times out of 10 these have enough holding power to work for what they are meant to be used on - data cables, etc.  But when you have a few coiled cables and things that are dissimilar, the velcro stickiness is just not very strong.",neutral
"For the price, this cover should be something innovative like the Smart Cover is for the iPad 2.On its own, this item is decent - but based on what you get, the price point should be $12-15.",neutral
"The cable did not fit my Coolpix 4300, which is fine since it isn't explicitly mentioned in the description... except that it supposedly fits cameras that use the same jack as the 4300. If you are buying these cables, make absolutely sure that they fit the USB jack on your camera. Otherwise, you'll just have a useless cable to eventually give away to a thrift store, since they aren't actually worth anything.",neutral
"I liked the design, weight and look, but it advertised to fit the Kindle 7&#34;, but it is too small. That was disappointing. Beware, if you have the Kindle 7&#34;, it won't fit, it's way to tight of a fit and the zipper will eventually cause damage.",neutral
This works as advertised. You do need to support the arm because the thumbscrew will not tighten enough to hold it.  I ended up buying a padholdr and installing that in my dash.  Much better.,neutral
"I ordered this stylus when I was just getting started with my Kindle as far as using it for games.  I've already replaced the tip once.  I think the styluses I just ordered will out this Bamboo to shame.  It may be fine for some, but maybe I am too much a bull in a china shop for this wimpy product.",neutral
"The design is a little flawed at the bottom cut out for the connector, leaves a very thing piece of material that soon breaks and then the whole thing kind of opens up and falls off. Looked very nice and beginning but not so good workmanship.",neutral
It's an ok case. I like that it's low profile. One thing that does bother me is that where the tablet is cradled it semi-blocks the volume button. Kind of weird that it was designed that way. Other than that it's fine.,neutral
"Received the cable quickly and when I used it to connecct to an hp printer, it wouldn't work. Returned with no issue.",neutral
when they work ... they work great but once in a while they will create a loud crackle sound.  Make sure everything is plugged in well and check it while recording.,neutral
"Good sound quality, but the ear buds have a weird design and they easily fall out of my ear.  It's also hard to position in such a way as to hear the quality bass tones.The mic isn't that great.  Not as good as the Apple headphones that came with my iPhone4.",neutral
"You get a lot for the money. The cord worked, the 12volt worked, and the AC plug worked, once! The second try it would not charge the ipod. Like I said, you pay cheap, you get cheap!",neutral
"I've tried most of the other iPad-targeted styluses and this one is pretty much the best.But, even given that, it's a bit short for larger hands. Plus, if you don't hold it at just the right angle (more upright than a pen), it tends to lose ""touch,"" leading to skips in your lines.It's not bad, but if you're expecting to get something similar to a TabletPC experience on your iPad, you will be disappointed.",neutral
I purchased this beacuse I was trying to replace my daughters ipod touch shattered screen. I also brought tools and a replacement LCD touch screen. It took me 5 hours to do the replacement. It was working but the screen do not lay flush. I tried to conrrect this imperfection and broke the ribbon.,neutral
cheap cable and works the same way. don't yank it too hard or the connection will break and the cable won't work anymore. but it's cheap enough where it isn't a problem.,neutral
Look great and it those the job but nor for me. Sometimes i want my camera on my neck and well with this you have to be with the camera in the hand all day long,neutral
"You'd figure the transfer rate would be noticable as I have a nice 3D high rated TV and these cables are used on my PS3 and Xbox360. However, I haven't noticed any difference in the play back ability of a bluray movie or anything. Infact, I still see some motion blur when I play a film. Guess this didn't really do the trick.",neutral
"overally poor quality, especially the cable is bigger than original and hardly fits to cased iphone, it stopped working on second use..good deal anyway",neutral
"Eh, it works but I didnt keep this tablet for long and the keyboard has a cable.",neutral
"This is an ok smartwatch. It does its job, but does not wow me. There was an update that improved some but it was not enough. I do like the you can switch the watch bands out.",neutral
"The Sony headphones aren't anything spectacular, they're just alright.  I notice some crackling when I hook them up to any device, but they're sturdy and compact.  I just put them in my purse and go.",neutral
"These batteries did not work as well as the PROCELL  siza AA, & AAA. I was compensated for the trouble. Service was good, batteries not as good.  Thanks  Chuck",neutral
As usual all cords only last so long then its time to buy a new one. At these prices it makes it less expensive.,neutral
"The light itself is excellent, especially when the batteries are new.  I don't use cheap batteries in this light but it doesn't seem to stay bright long.

"This tablet is a lot more complicated than expected and requires a lot of software and training. This is not what we expected. My son just wanted something that he could use for his drawing and it is very difficult to use.  Also, it should come with some kind of protective cover.  Not impressed.",neutral
Yes the antenna works.  Does both CB and the weather bands just as advertised.  It is not too well made since the grommet at the base of the antenna came loose the first time that it was used.  Some Gorilla Glue restored it back to service.,neutral
"I use it to power a 12 volt marine stereo in my outdoor kitchen.  Had a lower AMP model, two in fact by Pyramid that both burned out within a few months this one seems to work better but still s***s off after a few hours of use when it gets too hot and the cheap stereo does not draw much power",neutral

Not real sure but tried downloading drivers and everything but never really got this working. not sure if its the product or a conflict with something I have on my system.,neutral
I purchase the Klipsch reference series speakers and the hole pattern on the speakers are a 3&#34; center to center.  The brackets that come with these are for about a 2 1/2&#34; hole pattern.  Seem to be of good quality.  the drop protection is very easily detachable. I built a couple of brackets to mount to speakers and seems to be working out fine.,neutral
"This is an OK card. It has lots of memory, but I would recommend an external harddrive instead if you do not plan on storing something large to carry around with you, because it is very easy to lose.",neutral
"First of all, the rail is substantial, no lack of materials here. With that said, it just seems as if the individual parts were manufactured to loose tolerances which makes for a little slop when it's loose and a little bit of grab when it's snug. Overall the unit does perform well enough to do the job though.",neutral
"I know Sony does not care about app development and user feedback.  But you cannot have a camera that does not have a &#34;delete&#34; function built into the software.  Please fix, really like the QX10 camera but hate the app.  Delete should be a basic feature, you have to copy the photos you want and then format the card.",neutral
"Seems like a nice quality cable.  Spent more for this one to use my Ipad with my Sony MHC mini stereo system with Ipod dock.  Works fine, but does not indicate a charge. However, I have since learned that this does charge the ipad - it just does not show that it is charging! Works great.",neutral
Material looks like cheap leather look alike.  It functions just fine but not what I expected.  Was hoping for real leather.,neutral
it works just not sure how long it will last. bose charges a premium for everything so the quality shouldnt just be in the sound but in the build as well. not sure if i can recommend this since there are other headphones that are cheaper but offer similar sound and much better build quality i.e. v moda and sennheiser.,neutral
"Very nice case but doesn't show the apple logo and the little strap is a little hard to put it around the case or open the case when the strap is around.  I think it should be design a little different, I like targus cases but this failed in some aspects.",neutral

"I'm not totally certain that the HD Connect device gives you HD since there is no provision for HDMI cables, only component. Since the picture over the internet isn't perfect anyway I don't see where this device is all that necessary or really useful. Just another fifty bucks.",neutral
"I don't know why I bought this - I don't have a desktop.  I wanted a separate trackpad to keep the one attached to my keyboard safer from any dirt and allow me to be further away.  I don't really understand how to click on it unless I turn on tap-clicking, though.  It was kind of an unnecessary purchase for the price, and scrolling doesn't work all that well, but overall it works as advertised.",neutral

The speakers sound better than my flat screen TV. The sound quality could be better. Its missing that good sound you would get from a good sub woofer.

"Owned for three weeks and decided there wasn't enough bass (no seal problems here).  Even classical sounded lacking without decent bass.Also lacked ambience - transients - the sound of notes decaying and richocheting around your ear drums.  I got used to this, though, and didn't mind it.The bass I minded - even if just for classical, but there is also rock where bass is even more important!Decision made.",neutral
"Overall its an okay device, but for me, with astigmatism, if it had a dioptric adjustment, it would be better. For now, it would only work for someone with perfect vision, unlike me.",neutral

I guess you get what you pay for.  Thirty years ago Vivitar offered a quality product.  Seems like their quest for a low price point forced them to sacrifice quality.

It works and does what it should but i was expecting it to have better grip.

I have no gripes or complaints about this sleeve. It does a fit and do a good job of holding the keyboard. I do not consider it a great value.

Not horrible but it can't be compared to pricier units. The BIGGEST issue/drawback is that it will NOT accept a standard Arca plate.

Two issues that make it less than ideal: (1) The thick plastic makes it almost impossible to operate the iPod's controls. and (2) Inserting and removing the iPod aren't as easy as I'd like.",neutral
"does a great job connecting to Sirius, a louse of a job staying connected. It may work for a few weeks, then POW, clock jumps ahead, stations need to be reprogram in. Radio does sound good when playing.",neutral
"I guess I should have taken more time to read specs and or reviews but I got this to mount to a model rc plane (a lightweight champ) and realized fast this was too heavy to mount and fly on that plane at least, but it does offer good video so I will use it on the rc cars and maybe on some snowsledding this winter :)",neutral
"As protection for a keyboard in the kitchen, this is a welcome item given the cost of replacing Apple products. It is a bit thick and makes speedy touch typing difficult.",neutral
"Okay lens cap, the Micro fiber lens cloth is however of better quality than the actual item.  Imported item, not what I was expecting, would not buy from again, but item fits the need as advertised.",neutral
they hurt my head. puts so much pressure on my head/ears i get headaches. Sound is awesome which sucks because they hurt. I cant have them on my head for more than 3-4 songs.,neutral
"I haven't even used this cable rigorously, only once or twice a day for Skype conversations for work. But within 3 months of purchase it began to cut out and I had to adjust how the cord sat on the desk and then not move or it would break into hiss and pop. Eventually it just died entirely.",neutral
This works but gets crazy hot. I bought another brand later that does the same until you reach full charge then cools down. I'll use this for a backup. Yes I would buy it again but only if I could not find a competitive price equiv.,neutral
"It has a good relation betwen Price and quality.  If you look for something with better projection quality, it is not your choice.",neutral
"It is probably a good product, I bought it by mistake and did not return it.  So never been used",neutral
"It works in my camcorder, but I don't know if it works totally correct as the camera doesn't report how much battery is left.",neutral
"I hate tangled headphone cables so I have been searching for the best detangler. In my search, I came across this set. It is an interesting idea which works pretty well to hold and detangle your cable. However, it is more meant for the storage of the headphones rather than during the utilization.The Pros:- Will help protect your cable while transport.- Interesting shape.The Cons:- Bulky- Not practical to use while listening to music.Conclusion:Nice but there are better options.",neutral
"I was disappointed to find that this antenna only works with a coaxil plug.  Many modern TVs don't use coaxil anymore (like 2 of my tvs), so I could only use this on one of my old TVs.  It works well enough on that TV, but that is a pretty big limitation.",neutral
Does what its supposed to but adds noticeable bulk and weight.  The cover also doesn't close completely flat unlike the Apple smart covers,neutral
Haven't had any problems with speed or dropped connections yet (owned this device for a few months now). It's really difficult to get something into the slots. I have to use considerable force to jam the USB drive into the port; feels like the hub is going to snap! Overall the quality feels cheap - I guess you get what you pay for.,neutral
great because it has both the sd card slot and a jack to plug any iPod or else.No so cool because most of the time the sound sucks pretty bad... But then again I have never heard one that sounds good no matter what brand.,neutral
"I bought this for $30, and at $30, it's worth it. It serves as a ~40 inch projection with decent resolution. Can project this onto the wall or ceiling. I use it for ceiling projection to watch TV in bed.",neutral
"The product that was shipped to me is not the same as what is pictured.  I did receive the Stylus/styli, however, the are 100% plastic..including the clip.

"If I weren't a computer person, I probably wouldn't have been able to load the drivers.I loaded the drivers for Windows 7 from the disk first, then plugged in the device - didn't work.  To make a long story short, I uninstalled the drivers, plugged in the device & pointed to the appropriate drivers on the disk.Once the drivers were loaded, it worked great.",neutral
This does what it's intended to do but the flashing light drives me nuts. I finally put it in the USB port in the back of my laptop where I can't see it.,neutral
"This product comes with a short USB extension cable, a small antenna with clamps, a remote control and a F-pin to PAL adaptor.However, the device only has driver for Windows, thus if you plan to use this thing on OS X, Linux or embedded platforms you are out of luck. Besides it is said Broadcom had acquired the tuner business from ATi a few years ago, so drivers for other platforms are not likely to emerge.",neutral
The Good:+It's sharp looking+ It powers all the fans I've plugged into it (3 currently)The Bad:- The display (RPMs) only works for one of the fans connected.  I've verified that all three have 3-wire connections.,neutral
"This antenna worked well for a cheap-o. It is comparable to my Mohu Leaf in my Akron, OH house. I rated as a 3 star instead of 5 because when it arrive the assembly had been done very poorly within the housing causing the line to occasionally break giving an instant drop to 0 signal. Once I tore it apart and did things properly it has worked far better.",neutral
A mouse as sophisticated as this one needs a reasonable instructional reference. Of special concern is the programming of the buttons with a computer other than Windows-based machines is a hassle. The mouse itself is very practical but again a more detailed instructional reference (even on line) would have complemented the device nicely.,neutral
The fan will periodically get it's blade stuck inside the mesh of the pad. Otherwise it does the job fine.,neutral
"I really wanted to like this pair of headphones. It looks amazing; however, contrary to the reviews that I've read, the sound quality seems a bit lackluster, even after burning it in for around 100 hours. The sound stage did not impress me and the volume was a bit lacking.",neutral

"We use this camera in the baby's room to spy on him.  It works well, but the software and website are, well... really crappy.  I mean horrible.  The hardware gets 5 stars, the software gets 1.

Arctic silver is the most common CPU/heatsink paste.  I didn't use this and opted for an organic non-metal base thermal paste so metal 'dust' wouldn't get in my circuitry if/when I swap out CPU's.  One came with my top rated air heatsink.,neutral

"Seagate drives are usually high quality, and I have no reason to think that this one isn't, but it is quite noisy, and at a high frequency that really irritates me.  It's so maddening that I'm considering unplugging the drive, and only reconnecting it once a month for backups.",neutral
Product loads DVDs and Blu Ray discs quilckly and has a lot of wireless options. But the images just don't look as good as the Panasonic I replaced. Kind of wish I'd kept the old one. Will do until I can afford an Oppo.,neutral
"This is indeed an OEM drive - came with no warranty card, no SATA cable, screws, shipping list, manual or any other insert. If this drive goes south I don't have much of a paper trail to help me send it back. Purchased from Tech for Less through Amazon. I guess they ran out of them because the seller is now some other outfit.",neutral
"Functional but not very quiet. The flip outs could be a little higher, it is definitely higher quality though and I am glad I bought it.",neutral
"I was impressed out of the box, great build quality, great packaging, specs, etc. Then I turned it on. Even at idle speed the fan is too loud for anything other than a machine that is going to be tucked under your desk...far under your desk.  Ended up returning it and getting a PS  with a decently designed fan.",neutral
Item appears to be a little fragile.  Works great in a studio but would probably not travel well.  Price was great.,neutral
"If the camera gets shuffled around too much, the cap comes off. It's not that sturdy, but for the sake of protecting my lens while it's in storage, it works.",neutral
"Sound is amazing. Nice and portable. Although the only problem I am now finding is that it always has to be plugged into the outlet. You can't move it to any spot in the house and play music. Have to find a plug which isn't all that bad, just a hindrance. I prob wouldv'e bought the cheaper one that takes batteries or the more expensive one that has a chargable battery inside (wireless).",neutral
I ordered three of these and one of them was torm when i got it so it was unusable. The seller gave me money back right away but overall i dont like the item much. They are very very small and if you are using them to pick up slack on headphones they might work but I was suing them to store headphones and wasnt very happy with the results,neutral
"its feels a bit cheap...but thats because it is. the batteries in the mouse are AA but the keyboard is AAA which is a bit annoying. other than that its a pretty good deal plug and play, and i love the 5 button mouse, but if youre willing to spend the money i would pick up a Logitech Wave setup MK550",neutral
A lot of these hard drive enclosures feel surprisingly unsubstantial when you take them out of the box and this one is no exception. It feels cheap and it comes with one of those dumb throwaway plastic screwdrivers but it (mostly) works so I guess that's good enough for about ten bucks.,neutral
I like the feel of these and the sound of them also.  I only wish that I could adjust the sound volume from the control slider.  I can only mute the volume.  They fit snugly once you use the appropriate size rubber earpiece.,neutral
"Would of been happier had I known this was Passive and decided to get an Active instead. I still have use for it so won't be returning, but was still a downer.",neutral
"Without the fan noise, this camcorder is the best. I'm kinda perfectionist and a very little noise like that annoys me. Other than the fan issue, this is perfect. 1920x1080/60p footage from this cam is just unbelievable. Low light is performance is top-notch. Colors are accurate. I returned it because of the fan noise. I'm gonna try HDR-CX700V by Sony.",neutral
"Not what I was hoping for a 1080p quality, it was very fuzzy and audio sounded awful. I would recommend getting a nicer camcorder if you plan on recording anything important, did not work well for my sister's wedding.",neutral
Speed for reading this card is not as good as expected. May be my phone but 8 GB is okay.,neutral
"If you have a Galaxy 3, don't order this model; it's strictly for a Galaxy 2 with the camera hole in a different spot than the 3. I ordered this for the price/value and will not return it because it was my error in ordering it for the wrong model. It will work fine for a back-up if necessary.",neutral
"I purchased this blue ray player to support my other Samsung entertainment products including a HDTV and home theater.

"Pros: It cleaned jewelry wellCons: After 6 months of using it once a week, it stopped working.It was simple to use and it wasn't loud with the lid shut. The buttons feel cheap but they worked. It was a nice toy that didn't last. I wouldn't get it again.",neutral
Worked fine for a couple.  But ended up having to replace the Ethernet jack to a more reliable adaptor.  I thought the cable was the issue but was really the outlets.,neutral
"A little big, sucks power down, runs hot.  But other than that, it gets the job done solid.  Lets you pick resolutions up to 1920 x 1080 on MacBook air... you might ask why but still its nice.",neutral
It is a very good product and I'm happy with it. I'm very Happy with the subtitles option.  The only problem is that the remote control cannot be use on my Panasonic TV to control the volume and the buttons on the remote control are a little bit to small for me.,neutral
"Does what it says it will do.  Only thing is there isn't much selection for recorders. Priced right, can't complain.",neutral
"This unit really does allow you to take pictures underwater with no risk to damaging the camera. However, like anything else, you have to take care of it and make sure you don't scratch the lens.It's already outdated too, since there are far better cameras out on the market now and this case is specifically designed only for SD10 and SD20 Cannon cameras. It's too bad!",neutral
Words as advertised. Words required to fill in requirement to rate this product although it certainly isn't necessary to rate product.,neutral
"It worked fine in my pc while it was above my desk.  Then when I lowered it below my desk and it has awful performance.  I cut the plastic antenna attached to it and learned the antenna wire only went through about a quarter of the antenna.  This is terrible, but it performs ok.  My overall judgement: if you have to buy it it'll probably work but I wouldn't recommend it.",neutral
"Buying this protection plan, receiving it from the vendor, and storing it on the computer has been extremely easy. I hope to never use it so cannot really review how well it works.",neutral
"This screen protector isn't crystal clear, it messes up the pixel that goes into your eye therefore the viewing pleasure isn't very good. Get a regular crystal clear screen protector, it doesn't make sense to buy a protector thats finger print proof because you can always wipe off the prints, the most important thing to me is the viewing pleasure of a screen",neutral
I don't really use studio light but I keep this in car for that one day I might need it.  Actually I did use it one time the only challenge is the backdrops are always wrinkled and you can't get the crease out.  I just bought the rolled paper to use instead.  Everything else works fine.,neutral
"Really nothing special about this one.  Charges a bit slower that the $30 charger you would buy from apple, but still works and gets the job done.",neutral
I bought this product but it looks bigger than other 512MB USB drives,neutral

"It is an adequate cassette player - nothing spectacular. would have liked it to have auto reverse but, for the price it is OK",neutral
"However, the USB plug is too loose going into my Mac.  If I bump the wire, I lose connectivity to my external drive.  I've never had a USB plug with so much side-to-side play.  The fit and finish is a bit rough, but I'm not carrying it around.  It stays on my desk to backup my laptop when I am home.",neutral
the slightest bump causes the lens to malfunction. the camera isnt that easy to use. Mine is in a box ready to ship back for the second time to fix the lens. an expensive camera with too sensitive lens. i think a simpler camera may work as well. it does take good pics once you get it figured out though.,neutral
I really can't tell if is making a difference or not.,neutral
I have not had a change yet to use it with a projector yet. Looking forward to doing that soon.,neutral
I can't say much more than that. The power cable is A LOT shorter than the original so I'm not very happy with that but it does work never the less.,neutral
"Product is as described,  As pointed out by other reviewers, the lights are inadequate but if used with auxillary lighting, they will do a satisfactory job.  In spite of this one fault, the kit is more than adequate for table-top photography.",neutral
Couldn't get the remote to complete connect to the TV.  Only could get the volume and a few other controls to work not everything.,neutral
"Really like the idea of viewing remotely and it does work as advertised.Note 'advertised' includes warning about internet connection speed at both ends.Picture on mobile phone is excellent.  On large PC screen poor internet connections can lead to some distortion, but looks great with good speed.Overall not using as much as I'd like, which is why I rate it as 'ok'.  to be 'really liked' would mean I use it often instead of regular TV.",neutral
small convenient and practical.  remember the battery will last one year.  Not extraordnary but convenient for  taping seminars or so.,neutral

"Fits well and protects my new Kindle.  It's heavier than I expected, which is a negative.  I like that it shuts the Kindle off when I close the outside cover.",neutral
"It's great when it works. I've run into a problem with it freezing in the middle of recording (and then losing everything in that file) and it just randomly turning off in the middle of something (in my last 4 outings, it shut off 10 minutes in to one event and 12 seconds in to another).

"Its a very small radio, and it works.  Tinny sound, holds local stations, good battery life, light, simple. Tuning is tight but hard to fine tune. It does what I wanted it to do for the price.  Don't rush out to buy one unless it fits your needs for a very small radio.",neutral

Average compact camera for $300.  I tried Canon 500 HS and Nikon P300.  Both are better than the HX7V.HX7V has 2 fatal flaws I cannot tolerate:1) Slow.

But at this price point I was not expecting high quality, so just be aware you get what you pay for but it will get the job done.",neutral
it is just a power cord what should I say about it It works well it is white and has lots of plug ins,neutral
"I don't mind the brush aluminum finish, although I'd think for a &#34;portable&#34; drive, something less slippery would've been more practical. However the edges of the casing were not sufficiently sanded down, and could still cut a child or female's tender skin.I am sure it will perform well from the reviews I've read, and as this is a mature product line.",neutral

The TV works and the price was decent - The sound is horrible - Its almost annoying how poor the sound is - It bothers me to listen to it so I use the surround sound system to watch TV - Also the TV freezes sometimes when using the smart tv features and takes a moment to come back - For the same money Id get a different TV if I had the chance,neutral
"The cable is extremely thick and obtrusive, not like the apple brand cable.  It is not nearly  as flexible and I am not sure I would buy it again.  It certainly works fine and I didn't have any trouble fitting it through my case (Incipio) but it really is a step down from the apple cable.  Of course, it's significantly cheaper too.",neutral

"When I ordered this, I was expecting something a little sturdier. While this works, the wire seems very thin (more like speaker wire than AC cord).",neutral
Was not the right one...It was a gift and I should have snapped a pic of the port before ordering; make sure you look closely to your port before ordering.,neutral
"It's ok because the way it's cut it's not straight lines. Specially the pie sign has bumps everywhere, but the price was good so I'm not complaining too much. I will replace it i a couple of months.",neutral
This is a good portable drive. Works fairly fast. Pretty reliable. But it gets warm really fast. You can put a piece of toast on it to keep it warm. It's bulkier than other portable drives. Nice that it has multiple connections. USB and firewire.,neutral

The screen protector worth for price but the quality was not good. Within few days it got scratches and still the air bubbles are visible at screen.,neutral
"The waist belt stowed in the rear pushes the case inwards, so the camera body has to be forced in. If the waist belt is out, it would work fine, even with an 18-135 lens. Very little room for anything else other than the camera and the front pocket only just has space for a spare battery.",neutral
"This is a good backback with plenty of storage.  The actual dimensions were smaller than those listed on Amazon's spec sheet, though.",neutral
"The lens is good, the only problem is when I try to take it off the camera, it sometimes becomes difficult to remove.",neutral
It was low cost for a detector; But it needs to be outside and it uses up batteries very quickly;I guess it is for golfers. 18 holes and replace batteries.,neutral
The screw drivers were decent but the little plastic pieces broke almost immediately with light pressure.  I guess if you're extremely careful you might avoid breaking the plastics pieces.,neutral
"I have a 60 gig Vision M, & the case seems a little tight for the unit.  I noticed some scratches on the face of the player from just sliding it in & out of the case a couple times.I think I'll get a skin for it & see if I like that better.",neutral
"It's OK for just taking the camera along to use for a specific outing.  However, it's not very substantial/protective and there's no space or compartment for an extra battery.  It does have a little inside pocket which will hold one SD card.",neutral

"My favorites are still the hmdx jam classic, the kinivo, or the volcano, in that order. This has decent sound and pretty loud for a small speaker, but not as good quality as the others.

ive had this for a while now (over 6 months) and it has come in handy.  to me it seems like it charges my phone really slow.  also it seems like it dosnt hold its own charge for too long.  maybe a couple of days decreasing its charge even when youre not using it.  im sure there are better options out there by this time. it also seems really bulky.,neutral
"These don't last quite as long as the official Panasonic batteries, but for this price I don't really care.",neutral

"it wasn't better than other antennas, and it broke easily too.  The reception was clear though, and was easy to use.",neutral
Fairly comfortable.  Work very well. A bit confusing to tell if you have turned them off. Too delicate. The first two pairs I bought came in an intact box with cracked lenses.  Within one day of owning a new pair they were knocked off a sofa onto a hardwood floor and the lens cracked. My sunglasses wouldn't break with such a small fall.  It seems unless you are very careful these will not last as long as you TV.,neutral
"The charger isn't exactly aesthetically pleasing, but it does what it's supposed to.  Seems to charge a smartphone faster than my computer.

"It's a pretty cheap card and has a good amount of storage, but it has fairly slow write performance. Some competitors' MicroSD cards offer much faster performance for similar prices.",neutral
"The good news is that the card has only failed once, the bad news is that I only used it once. After loosing 100+ pictures I no longer have confidence in the card. Because it is a full size SD, it has little use outside of a camera. I am open to usage suggestions for it, so far it has not worked well as a can opener, Frisbee, or as a bookmark.",neutral
"I bought this for taking pictures of products to sell on eBay.The studio part is pretty descent, but the lights are weak. This may work better in sun light out doors or buy more powerful lights.The included &#34;tripod&#34; is worthless for a DSLR, it is intended for use on a small point and shoot camera.Overall, not a bad product.",neutral
"This cable works perfectly, but it wasn't designed the best. The better cable is the L9, which places the cable coming out of the dock on the side, rather than the bottom. This makes for a much smaller package when trying to stick your ipod and a DAC in your pocket.",neutral
"This is exactly what it says it is...  an USB extension cord.  It allows you to connect a USB device to your computer without having to have them right next to each other.

Additionally, when using the extension cable the amount of time required to power pass (charge) a device goes up exponentially.",neutral

This case does afford further protection to the ipad but I have found when you turn the keyboard around so it is out of the way (on the back side of the ipad) you will accidently touch a key and it turns on the keypad and then you either have to wait for it to time out or turn the keypad off. Otherwise this works as designed.,neutral
"Originally got these for snow boarding and fosnowboardingund a few things on the mountain.It does not go though rock. Often times the top, bottom, traverses are separated by hills that the signal has trouble bouncing around.

Nice strap. Should do the job for me when traveling to foreign lands. Just a bit stiff and doesn't fold easily into carry case when attached to camera. The clasps on the strap have a cheap locking mechanism and don't protect the clasp from being opened by a thief. One of the &#34;locks&#34; was actually split and fell off when I attached the clasp to the ring. I have have to rig some other &#34;lock&#34; when traveling.,neutral
"Yes, this is a nice sleeve as others have noted, but I was disappointed that my two-piece power supply would not fit in that outer pocket.  Yes, as another reviewer noted about their similar issue, I suppose you could stuff the three-prong AC cord in the main pocket beside the netbook, and then leave the brick and cord to the PC in the pocket, but that wasn't what I was expecting.",neutral
Not too bad but not the best. It feels too spongy and not as firm as my previous neoprene case.,neutral
Tiger is better than amazon on the case. I ordered the same one from amazon and fans were not working. I hope this case won't break any soon. Have to let you guys know that front panel isn't really strong peace. So take it easy when open and close. This is a good looking case. But for quality I suggest other brand like cooler master.,neutral
Buy a Zune. This is not good for video. Too small. This is the first Sony product that I wish I would not have purchased.,neutral
These paper sleeves are very thin compared to the Memorex ones.  They will work fine for giving away free cds but I wouldn't use them for anything needing that professional touch.

"Good price for the screen size. Im using this with an led projector and it makes the picture look fine. The inner mechanisms are working but not without a lot of trouble.

"Works OK, but range is very limited.  Not nearly as good for mirroring as Apple TV for iOS devices.",neutral
This case offers good protection for the transformer. My only complaint is that it adds way to much bulk to the tablet. That is why I very seldom use this case. I normally use a slipcover for my Transformer.,neutral

Cap keepers are very cheap and won't last long.  The first one we put on only lasted a day.  The filters and cleaning cloth did work just fine and I would give them five stars.,neutral
"I agree with others saying that the rubber band holding the sleeves together is a bad design. It crumples the plastic on some of the sleeves and ruins them. The product itself is usable (and most of the sleeves are fine), but seven dollars is really too much when you end up getting less than you asked for. I think next time I'll buy some sleeves that aren't crinkled before I get them.",neutral
I bought this as replacement for my chinese hotshoe and it works as advertised. not great or bad for the price.,neutral

"It's really just a big fan.  The device works, but it elevates the laptop a good inch or so off the surface making the angle of typing slightly off.  Also, the device is fairly loud.  Sounds like an airplane is about to take off.  I originally bought it for my daughter, but I don't believe she's using it anymore.  It got to a point where the noise alone was the big turn off.",neutral
I had to take it out because it took some of the screen sharpness. Put a regular screen. Much better.,neutral

I got this on sale and I am mostly satisfied with it. It is designed for earlier generations of iPads so it does not have the hole for the forward facing camera and in order to adjust the volume you have to fight the elastic that holds the iPad in.,neutral
I see some people saying they received adapters that were not metal but the one I got was metal. When I connected headphones to an extension cord I had to reseat the cable the first time due to static but then it cleared up. No static but the sound was impaired. You get what you pay for.,neutral
The mouse works good but the case was tinny. For Logitech it was a surprise. If you are going to use it as your main mouse I would recommend spending a couple of bucks more. For a spare or traveling mouse its ok but the plastic is hard and it doesn't have a soft feel in your hand.,neutral

"This gizmo is sensitive to the surface it is on... much more than other optical mice I've used.

Amazon has a great selection of ac power adapters.  Unfortunantly  I picked the wrong ac power adapter for my tablet.,neutral

"Purchased this item from Amazon for $26.42, that's the good part. Followed everyone's advice about NOT turning the radio on until this device had found an adequate signal. Not impressed with sound quality, may be do the fact the car antenna is located on the rear fender, a substantial distance from this unit. Regular radio sounds much better. Would recommend purchasing car stereo with USB or RCA input if you're looking for quality sound.",neutral
"works like it's supposed to. I don't like the format, Flash cards are much better, but I needed it for this application...",neutral

It was pretty cheap after all.",neutral
It works. But I took some time to figure out where the battery goes? The top and bottom cover seems not too tightly sealed. But it works though there is little noise. There is no way to power it off when using with battery.,neutral
"Great little case. Fits well though yes it is hard to get the headphone jack plugged in, but not too hard. I actually really liked it until the spring setup broke. I still don't know what did it.

These are actually pretty good monitor earphones for their price. They have all the appeal of more expensive models such as the Shure SE215 but for a fraction of the cost. I've used these as monitors for live performances and was really impressed.,neutral

Just received mine from Amazon. The thread is fine and the hood can be installed easily.

The product does what it is suppose to do which is keep the glass from getting scratched.  It is a little tricky to put on without having bubbles underneath.  I would give it a better rating but the way it arrived was disappointing.  It was packed in a padded envelope and during shipping it was dented leaving a permanent dent in the proctector.,neutral
Don't get all hot and bothered. That's just a description of the product. Sorry. I ordered this by mistake and currently have no use for it. DO YOU?,neutral
I use this on my Vivitar DF-293-CAN and I've noticed that it tends to slide off the flash a bit. So if I were walking around with it on camera at a 90 degree angle it would probably fall off. Since the only time I ever really have my flash pointed in that direction is when it's mounted to a light stand the diffuser stays in place. Still a bit annoyed that its not that secure.,neutral
"The light I ordered didn't work and I had to return it.  However a friend ordered the light and it works great, so I'll probably give it another try as the price is right for the kit.",neutral
"I guess I should be glad that this is not as &#34;chatty&#34; as the last weather radio we had, but I find it is not chatty enough.

It hasn't stopped working though, so for that I am glad.",neutral
"Other than the fact I bought it refurbed, which I do all the time, this thing came clearly used for a significan't amount of time (at least 6 months). I'm an IT guy. I see wear and tear on these kinds of items. The mouse seemed great except for what someone else pointed out. If you want to use it EVER on any surface other than a mouse pad it's not going to work well.",neutral
"After reading all the reviews I decided why not?  It works well enough for the price.  A top pro would not bother with this, but for the type of work I do it fills the bill nicely and cheaply.",neutral
This cord has a very good price but it is VERY thin and fragile.  Need to keep this in mind. It is much thinner than a normal 3.5 mm cord.,neutral

"When these speakers first arrived, damn was I impressed. The quality was superb and the bass rocked amazingly. For this price, these speakers totally rocked! But the reason I am giving it a 3/5 is because about a month in of use, the circular volume tuner thing broke and caused only the left speaker to work. Although I am disappointed as to how it broke, I do know the cause if it and will be fixing it soon..",neutral
Ok its a plasticdisk blah blah blah blah blah blahblah blahblah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah hlah,neutral
I gave the low rating because it would really be easy for them to label right and left ear instead of making me read the manual and remember which model I have.  Once you get the fit right they are awesome.,neutral
The performance of the earphone is good but there is no way to adjust the fit. It just have to fit or not. Very limiting for some users. Also the metal stem where it connects to the rubber ear clip is very fragile. Mine seems to have become loose.,neutral

"This is a good hood for the price. I tried it on my Canon T3i with my 50mm lens and it fits fine. My only problem is the lens cover is difficult to put on with the hood in place so it takes some wiggling around to get it right. It doesn't feel like a high quality hood, but then again, I wasn't expecting it to be.",neutral
"Bought this case as it was recommended for the ASUS Memopad, however there is no hole for the charging cord or the headphones. I had to make the holes myself. In the future I will buy the cover at the store so I can see if it is the correct cover for my tablet. Too late now.",neutral
It worked perfectly for a few months then the picture on my tv would be off the the top left corner and it just wouldnt work so I had to buy a new one from the store instead. But while It did work I used it for projecting 1080p HD video to my 30 inch tv and displayed great image quality.,neutral
"This is a great DVD player, but the specs say that there is an HDMI port. The S48 DOESN&#34;T have an HDMI Port... the S68 does for a few more dollars.I would have ranked this a 5 star product if the description was correct.",neutral
Installs easily on my 24 inch Dell Monitor. Sound is ok for watching DVD movies but not that loud. Good for late night movies....,neutral
I find that this unit works. However what is not too great is the fact that it is rather easy to drop out of the ASUS. Must be careful with the unit or it will unplug. Also may provide easy way to cause problems for the keyboard connector if you  don't handle the unit very carefully when plugged in.,neutral
"The sound from the headphones was great, however, they broke far too easy. Wish the quality of the materials was as good as the sound.",neutral
This item is cool it even comes with a charger cord for the cigarette lighter in your car. My only problem is that the quality on these types of transmitters suffers sometimes.  It will get distorted after a few minutes and then it is useless. I dont know if it is just my car or what so I can't say for sure if it is the fault of the product.  it's really little and cute though!,neutral
"The specs say it has a 170 degree view range, but I'm not sure it's 170 degrees.  It works good, just wish I could see a wider view.",neutral
"The illumination of the keys is perfect.  They're not too bright or too dim.  The blue color of the illumination is beautiful as well.  I can use this keyboard in a dark room.  It is a little smaller than other keyboards but not significanly so.  I didn't find it's smaller size to be uncomfortable or inconvenient.  On the downside, the keys are noisy, giggly, and feel cheap.  So I gave it three out of five stars.",neutral
It holds my phone and that is what I wanted it for. Fits well in my Toyota Tacoma. Doesn't fit at all in my Mini Cooper cup holder.... pops out to easy.It adjusts well once you get used to it. This is not a stiff hold as it wobbles a little bit through bumpy conditions... but that is to be expected with a flexible arm.,neutral
"I enjoyed their sound while they lasted, but a weird thing happened to them: the rubber coating on the cord (the part between the two earbuds that goes behind your neck) started splitting into ribbons and breaking off. It's not like I was abusing it, I don't understand what happened to it. Since then, I've been using a sennheiser cx300-b which has been great.",neutral
"I recently bought this antenna and the ASUS RT-AC66U router, whilst the router is fabulous, I feel that this antenna while functionally it does what it is meant to do is over priced compared to a similar one I bought from Alpha which does the same thing and is 50% cheaper, hence the 3 stars.",neutral
"Picked up for use with GBox-Midnight MX2 (Android box, with xbmc, etc).  Only real issue is can't use this to turn the gbox on/off.  Using an air-mouse is also a bit of an acquired skill.  the Mele generally does exactly what it's supposed to do.",neutral
"I used this product for several months with good results.  Then one day I plugged it into my laptop and the OS didn't even sense a new drive.  I tried it on several laptops and tower computers in my possession and at work but not a single one of them recognized the drive.  Could'a been a fluke, specially given HPs reputation, but it still points to the need to backup important files onto a computer because I lost everything.",neutral
"This is a nice cable.  It works well and was reasonably priced, until you add in the shipping.  Then it's just an overpriced cable.",neutral
When installing these mounts I broke one from I guess over tightening.  Very cheap plastic.  I would recommend you buy extra because you will probably break one or two yourself.  Recommend you only use for small speakers,neutral
"i'm using it because my computer is far from me, so its giving me a benefit. the only problem is, i thought because i had to plug a dc power adapter that i would be able to charge my phone even if the computer was off. thats not the case. the computer has to be on. the dc adapter is useless. you don't need the adapter in order for the hub to work..... go figure",neutral
"Nothing too fancy with this receiver, but it provides solid audio/video quality and has plenty of inputs for the average household.  If you're really into AV then you probably won't be satisfied with this level of product, but for those who just need a reliable home av receiver, it's a good buy.  The Airplay option to wireless play your iPod/iPhone music over the system is a really nice feature.",neutral

The ear pieces are very tight for me space wise.  My ears are not abnormal in size but I have to put them over my ears carefully so that they won't hurt after awhile having some portions pinched by the ear pieces.  They clamp pretty tight also.  All else are great.,neutral
It's easy to use but the &#34;help&#34; and &#34;manual&#34; are awful if you have an unusual problem.  The light isn't much of an asset for night shooting.  I bought it for a single project.

"Works ok except for the problem with the squelch that bleeds thru and is very annoying.  Seem to me they should have fixed that by now.

The sound quality these give out is distance and not all the music. You would need to plug in hafe way for the sound to be corrected.,neutral
Fit on my desk. It was not immediately clear how that would work - but after some pushing and pulling on things it became clear. I do like the build quality. I think for the price maybe they could have added something to help with the cabling on the headset as well.,neutral
"I bought this for my MBP with retina display (late 2013 version). It fits very well. I like its minimalist design. It's water resistant and has a little flap inside for extra protection.

"Nice product, but don't expect premium sound. My only real complaint about this headset is that when I'm stretching, doing Yoga, etc. and laying on my back, the headset falls off of my neck. It needs a little rubber clip to hold the two ends of the necklace together so when you are prone it doesn't fall off. Voice quality is good, not great.",neutral

This is really just a sleeve for your iPod. It doesn't have much in the way of protection other than to keep it from being scratched. Which is fine if that is what you are looking for.

I can certainly see the worth, however, in being stranded with a only a dead iPhone and this nifty little gadget to keep you company.  Definitely a useful thing to have, but limited in its functionality and usefulness unless, again, you're an iPhone owner.DYB",neutral
i think my fren like this item he has a band an he love music music is his thing right,neutral
Thsi works okay . . . but the build quality is poor. There is a paper label stuck to the bottom of it that has technical specs that looks like it will fall off in 2 weeks. The quality is poor for a product that is not the lowest priced out there. Expected much better.,neutral
I purchased this lens because I really wanted something for really low light shooting. Problem is that this lens is soft when used wide open which kinda defeats the purpose of having a f/1.4 lens. It might work for you but I will just stick to using my 24-70L.,neutral

"But I really only bought it for the sub, as I already have two near-field studio monitors.As a system, the output is pretty weak. As the other reviewer mentioned, there is a real lack of midrange. This is probably fine if all you listen to is hip-hop, but with any other style of music, it really suffers.Should also work fine for gamers, but it's not a surround system, so why bother?",neutral
Works okay as long as you get around the front of the camera and not to far away. A good buy for the money.,neutral
"3 stars because although it says it fits two drives, it would be near impossible for the cables to fit nicely right next to each other. That pain in the butt alone is why 3 stars vs 4 or 5. Otherwise its great.",neutral
I'm not a professional and I don't use the flash that often so this product wouldn't work for me.  I have tested it and it's alright though it's only designed to fit on their own product.,neutral

The wires worked as directed and there isn't much to say about them other than they worked as designed - they are okay.,neutral
"These headphones have pretty good detail, and good bass, but the trebles are extrememely hot and the mids are almost missing.

The downside of proprietary connections is that we are forced to buy at ridiculous prices. $30? Who do they think they are? Apple?,neutral
Development is lacking some. Interface is not up to par with today's touchscreen standards. I had the intention of plugging my phone in and forgetting it.

"The bottom line is that it adds ports to an older television which was my ultimate goal. At this price it was well worth it. The only issue I have is that it does not automatically recognize which device is powered on. I have yet to have this device do this. If I turn on the cable box first thing in the morning when the last thing was the gaming console, I do have to change inputs manually.",neutral
"I think that this remote has the advantage of the menu button, but this is only to lock the cradle with the remote. The functios are teh same like another controls that cost 10 dollars. The unique difference is that has the apple design (a little more quiality of the remote)",neutral

interesting but I think the space on the main tablet is perhaps just a bit smaller than idea.  It is well constructed but the useable area I do think compromises what you can draw and create.,neutral
Easy to hook up and use. The only thing is I tried everything to have the person I was speaking to hear my words clearly. They said it had hissing and distortion. I lowered it and never talked with the air condition or radio on. I worked on the volume in every way I can. But it never sounded clear to who I was speaking to. I ordered a different speakerphone so I will see how that works.,neutral
"Works fine, however the layout of the socket, switch, etc., did not match the cutout of my HP case.  I had to notch some sheet metal with tin snips.  That might be an HP thing.",neutral
"This is my 2nd cloth back drop. They work fine but since I am not able to leave it up, it sucks having to steam it everytime I use it. I fold it and hang it on a hanger but it doesn't matter. If you aren't able to leave it up 100% of the time, I would recommend looking at a vinyl instead.",neutral
"I purchased two of these at two different times.  It works and has a pretty good sound, it is just cannot get very loud (a lot of background noise will easily drown it our).  We have only use them on occasion, so they do not get used a lot (maybe once a month).  One of the ones we purchased died shortly after the warranty ran out.",neutral
"I had some old 1950's slides that had mold (?) spots. I read good reviews on this product and ordered it. I tested it first on some unimportant film and it worked fine. Unfortunately on one of my important slides it scratched it. I was also using the ""tiger cloth"" so not sure what could have scratched.  I still recommend it but be very careful and test first.",neutral
"I use this for one of my two monitors and it works good.  It was hard to install since the hand screws are small and don't have slots to use a screwdriver to tighten them.  Wished they had a larger hand screws on them, then this would be a great product. Other than that it works well.",neutral
"This unit was supposed to fix the problems I was having with a PS/2 only KVM switch.  It did not do so, as there's probably something wrong with the PS/2 mouse port.",neutral
Very weird feeling the first time i wore em. Slightly uncomfortable but it does keep out sound. Not for me.,neutral
This one is small.  But ventilation is poor for this and I end up buying an extra case fan for this.  Also the hard drive bay's screw position is a little funny.,neutral
"Looks good, and it works. But you still need a separate case or bag for the cable and other parts.",neutral
"Works just as well the OEM battery did, and looks like it as well. Although neither of the batteries last very long on a single charge.",neutral
Super build quality and great look but difficult to mod for practical use.  This will require some time to fit all hardware appropriately as well as a few tools and little muscle.  Be careful with the face though its super fragile.,neutral

"Good for the price, but not what I wanted.  I should have spent a bit more for a better product.",neutral
"It is much harder to use than a gps watch. I have to download course at home as it needs wifi. More complicated than I wanted. Cannot shut it off or data is lost. Couldn't get aerial views unless connected to wifi which seems pretty useless. Does give lots of info but if I had to do it again, I would have bought a watch.",neutral
"Works fine. The quality of the record is good, in particular clear. The coated of the wire is not good. I suppose that his util life isn't very long.",neutral
"Looks better than average, but it sounds average with battery on and unusable without batteries.  Noise canceling is acceptable, but these are only noise cancelling headphones I ever had so I can't compare with others.",neutral
"The camera keeps showing - please change battery pack after every 6-7 snaps. When you switch on and off it gets fine. Really annoying. Used the original NB-6L and the problem went away. Quite annoying. Though if you are fine doing the switch on-off, this does last forever.",neutral
But the lcd screen was to small.  I  kept this one for my wife and ordered one with a larger display screen.,neutral
"November 2012: Good product. Too bad that Sanyo stresses ""pre-charged"" because they only had about one-quarter charge when I received them. Didn't matter to me but somebody out there might care.April 2013: I purchased four more. Also came with only 1/4 charge. The blister pack claims that they will hold 75% of charge after three years. Something is not right. Perhaps they are counterfeit batteries?",neutral

"Antenna does give better reception than the two rabbit ears digital antennas I tried but still must be turned a little this way and that to bring in the same persistently annoying channels we originally were having problems.

"I bought and returned these for only one reason, they are not true over the ear headphones, but rather, a hybrid of over the ear with an &#34;In the ear&#34; ear bud.

Radio has lots of nice features and generally works quite well. I live in a hilly area and reception is at times spotty. Also use at a local harbour and the reception is great. Location will dictate reception. Have been unable to get any SW reception. Nice size and great battery life.,neutral
"Bought this December 2011.  It gave more cordless time for the laptop.  The computer is messaging that the battery does not have much time left.  Definitely does not last as long as the original.  At $34 each, just buying the Dell original may be worth it.",neutral
These are not terrible speakers by any means. But they definitely aren't great speakers either. I know they are mostly meant for highs but i really feel i could have gotten more for my money. If you really want to crank up your systems i would not recommend these speakers.,neutral
Traffic features are allright... I don't think they will ever be able to &#34;perfect&#34; that.Be careful buying a refurbished model.  I wasn't able to update the maps and I had to explain that the original owner didn't' own it anymore and that I bought it off Amazon.

"This works well for my home media center and when I want to use a separate keyboard for a laptop quickly, but it's still wireless and runs on batteries so it's not perfect, but probably about as close to it as they can get.

It changes the thickness of the tablet. I wish it were slimmer and less heavy.They could also incorporate some pockets for accessories.,neutral
"The case fits perfectly on the new iPad, everything is fine, the sleep/wake function works perfectly fine. It's just the viewing angle, it's too high. There is only ONE angle.

So far so good. This was a presemt for my wife. She has a nice I-pod classic but it does not have FM radio built in.

"I have Bose products and many other speaker systems and know what good things sound like. I am really disappointed. They feel great! and look great!

"This little gizmo seems to work ok, although I'm sure if I used a &#34;real&#34; level to check if it was truly level, I'm guessing it would be a bit off.

If you're looking for a precision instrument, this isn't it.",neutral
"I used this to amplify music during my Christmas eve gathering, but found at the highest volume levels on any setting there was some distortion. At lower levels the sound is actually quite good.

This short extension cords are great when you need one for plugging in the chunky power power packs in the last outlet.,neutral
The large number of false alarms with this unit limits its usefullness. The display is also difficult to see so one has to rely on the sound for warnings. The compass is so difficult to see against a bright background that it is also useless.,neutral

"I already own a great collection of closed can , such as Bose Q3 , Shure 840 , ATM-50 , so I decided to add an open back one and I chose this due to user reviews , The reason I gave it  3 stars is because they get distorted at high volume especially id used with the FiIo E12 , but at low volume the sound pretty nice but have to admit the Shure wins.",neutral

did not hold up to my rough handling.  cracked within weeks.  worked as a protective filter. bought new one for lens,neutral
Had to send this one back. It does not have a headphone jack. The description didn't say it did but pretty much thought that would be included. If you don't need the headphone jack then this would be a good unit for the price.,neutral
"This battery does not last near as long as the original Panasonic did when it was new but at the low price Amazon has on these you can have several batteries in reserve. Otherwise, it fit fine and looks like the original except for the  labeling. I would buy them again and always keep one in the camera, one in the pocket and one in the charger!",neutral
"I bought these because I wanted something that kept the headphones in my ears. They do a very good job at that. But I stopped using them because the sound quality is not very good. Bass is acceptable, but it changes the mids and highs a bit and I don't care for it.",neutral
"Works well enough, although I should have expected a limited broadcast range due to the size. The Toshiba stack drivers work better than the included drivers.",neutral
"This battery doesn't last very long but if you are looking for something cheap that'll do the trick by giving you an extra LITTLE boost, this is your battery pack.It isn't very expensive so if you wan't something cheap and will give you a little boost of battery this is the product for you!",neutral

My only complaint is that the foot comes off, easily without any effort. Under the foot is just a tiny ball, which will easily be damaged after a hike or a day out on the town.",neutral
"I use this to hook up my Macbook Pro to my 42"" TV.  It is nice that it carries audio on the cable, so the sound comes out of my TV, too.  This lasted about a year before it stopped working.  Not sure if that is an acceptable lifespan.",neutral
"Well-constructed, and classy looking. May be a bit of overkill, as GPS units normally(?) come with their own small cases that can be dropped in one's pocket/purse. This certainly provides enhanced protection but is too large to be carried easily on a routine basis.",neutral
"Fast ""enough"" better than netbook, the right price, keyboard is quite good for my use, screen pretty good, The only gripes I have is the display does not go back far enough, and fingerprints really show up on the surface since its got a gloss finish.",neutral
"The plastic case is cheap and the connection with the cable detaches very easily, I'm the fence about it, kind of so-so.",neutral
"I'm neither thrilled nor disappointed with this purchase.  For the price, it seems to work well.  Plug it in, press the button, and talk.  People sometimes talk back.  It works.",neutral
"It's okay if you use the full length, otherwise the line doesn't hold weight of wet clothes. Small garments are fine, but anything larger like a shirt or trouser can take the line down.",neutral
"This strap would be great, if it was a bit longer. The strap is quick release and easy to install. Extended to it's full length it only sits in the upper-middle chest, which is pretty awkward. Unless this sounds good to you, avoid it.",neutral
"This thing would not hold a small camera in place when wrapped around a small tree branch, it is ok if you want to sit it down some place to take a picture. I wanted some thing to wrap around  small branches to take pictures and Video of birds.",neutral
"The cables work as intended.  One of the cables, I occasionally had to shake to get to work.  I took it apart and fixed it(easy fix).  Now it works just fine.",neutral
"I bought this because it seemed to have more consistent reviews than the really cheap chargers, but was much less expensive than the high-priced chargers. The connector to the iPod is a bit stiff, but it works fine.",neutral
"Our big ol' attic antenna needed some help so I added this to the loop.  It has an optional power injector/amplifier that actually degraded the signal when I plugged it in.I cannot explain it, but at this point, if it ain't broke I ain't going back up in the attic to fix it.",neutral
I purchased two Nikon Coolpix L18 years ago and found the product to be average for the price.  It has a pretty good zoom for a point-and-shoot camera.,neutral
"I bought this from the Play Store, and while it does fit the Chromebook perfectly, it is very thin and would do nothing to protect the Chromebook in the event of a drop.  There are more durable alternatives available for 1/3 of the price.",neutral
"This product worked for a while. However, now the converter doesn't seem to work after an update from Apple. It is good if you can get it to work.",neutral
The monitror matches the clients other NEC monitor and was good for multiple screens.  They didn't care whether the monitor was used or not.,neutral
I put this on and it protect my tablet fine. the only issue is that it does not line up to the screen. it is too big for the tablet. that is why i gave 3 stars,neutral
I have one that is better,neutral
This is a great looking and feeling product.  I love how it feels.  It does not protect your iPod from falls.  I dropped it from a chair - maybe 18inches - and the iPod was damaged and needed service (yeah for Square Trade).,neutral
I have just change camera and I am trying to reassemble to fit my new one.  I am sure it will be fine.,neutral
"I have an iPhone 5s with Apple's new leather case and the Lightning connector on this AmazonBasics cable will not fit (the plastic housing is bigger than Apple's connector and is too big to fit through the hole in the leather case). The cable works fine (no compatibility issues with iOS 7), so I ended up using my grinder to shave off some of the plastic. It's not pretty but the connector fits now.",neutral
"I bought the Westinghouse TX-42F430S 1080p television and this HD-DVD unit.  But, the two hate each other and I could not get any video.  This is also well documented in the AVS forums.  I don't know which to blame.  Probably the TV.  But I wanted to warn everyone.",neutral
Not as soft as original equipment.  Ok for the money.  Will probably buy again instead of spending money on original equipment.,neutral
Replacement for a Craig branded digital converter.  This one doesn't hold the stations as well.  Still have a Craig converter in the front room and it pulls more stations and more importantly holds them better. This iView has many more features but fails at its primary function of tuning.,neutral
I've used one of the protectors but it seems to collect finger prints worse than the screen so I've decided to go without the protector for now.,neutral
"Overall works good. Worth the price definitely. Wish it had more wire so I could hook it up so it's  on whenever the car is on, but I suppose I'll have to just buy more wire.",neutral
I suppose this is worth it if you cannot get any wireless reception whatsoever but I get a strong 13mbps through wireless and a weak 6mbps when using this.,neutral
"I did not realize the stand is not made for a Kindle Fire HD and ordered the wrong thing, but I gave it to my grandson who has a standard Kindle. The chargers work very well, but I did receive a headset that had one long wire and one short one and nothing I did would adjust it so it was even on both sides. The rest of the outfit is nice, though.",neutral
I received this cleaning set for my camera and lenses and thought its cool. Not much to say about this at the moment.,neutral
"There were some things we liked about this, but more things we didn't. After using PCs for years, we found the sparse screens and options a little confusing. Would a &#34;close&#34; button be so hard to incorporate into a browser or email client??? We found navigating through things to be not so intuitive, and at times frustrating enough to head for the PC. After going through this for a while we finally gave up and returned it to Amazon",neutral
"The Pogo Radio Your Way is a brilliant idea. Sort of like Tivo for radio. The unfortunate problem is...the radio has poor reception. Even the 50,000 watt stations on AM were filled with static. Recording static-filled radio is not my idea of fun. Returned for a refund. Disappointed. Not worth $179.00.",neutral
Probably over-priced but I had gift cards and needed something for my wireless keyboard and mouse. It works so what else can I say?,neutral
I bought this for my work. I use it as package scanning system for my office. This thing runs out of power in two days with just slighly use. I have to charge it almost every other day with light usage. I would recommend Asus or Sony.,neutral
"It works well, but the batteries feel flimsy and cheap.Holds a charge well, but not as well as the Sony OEM batteries that came with my NEX series cameraBobby Pynes",neutral
"Fairly easy to setup, mainly creating an account on TrendNets site and register the camera under your login. Makes access from anywhere-easy. Good camera lens but the mounting bracket is poorly thought out.",neutral
"When this flash works, it works well. I can't always count on it to fire even when I force that option. I purchased it mainly as an inexpensive external flash so it's still useful to me. My Canon speedlight far out performs the Yongnuo.",neutral
The adapter worked fine but was quite slow. Even after connecting at 150Mb to the router I would still only get 600KB in transfers between my server and my PC. The adapter would work fine for basic internet use but not for LAN traffic.,neutral
I bought these in order to play online multi-player games as well as for VOIP.  For their price the set works fine though it's important to keep the audio lower than expected otherwise what you hear is perceptible to the microphone.  I am still using them and find them sufficient at a good price.  They will certainly do until I have found a set that is less susceptible to the ear phones conducting into the microphone.,neutral
"The hardware is absolutely wonderful, built extremely well. The software is the issue with this device. It is SO buggy and SLOW. There are a decent amount of services available but it is SO slow. The only reason I keep it is because you can plug a USB stick in and watch basically any format of video on it. It does have great video and sound quality but like I said the software is bad.",neutral
"Side was quite small for the 8x21 and cool, but the quality of the picture wasn't as good and crisp as I was expecting.I give it a 3 stars out of 5 because I thought it could have been better.I'll try some other to see if it worst than this, and if they worst, I'll boost this to 4 stars.",neutral
pliers are magical! I used mine to connect my dslt to my monitor. the plus+ sign portion did not fit correctly I just matched up what was used on my monitor receptacle and pulled the extra teeth from this adapter. 3 weeks delivery time from China but it works great now.,neutral

"kinda hard to read in the sunlight, dont get it if you like to have the system tell you the name of the song and artist  when you listen to the radio. its really annoying switching from ipod to tuner or whatever other option. could def work on user interface. It gets the job done though.",neutral
"Device looks beautiful and seems functional but just got it today and have not had a chance to use it.  There are not instructions for how the use the built in flashlight nor does it say that it AC CHARGER NOT INCLUDED. Will leave a more detailed review after 3 months of usage. They could also give better instructions on how to extend the battery life.Also, there customer service seems good. The responded to my email within four hours.",neutral
"Too tight, and I have a small/average sized head.  Gave it to my 6 year old, still pretty snug.  I'm not expert on NC technology, but of the 3 different kinds I have in this price range, this one is the worst.",neutral

Very loose for Macbook pro with retina display. Not tight enough even for a regular macbook pro. I'm looking forward to a new product from the manufacture specially designed for retina macbook pro.,neutral
I have had one for each of my Bogen tripods I like it  It is a great product if you have a hand free to carry it. It  would be better if the strap was longer so you could shoulder it. I would recommend it to a friend and would buy this again if needed.,neutral
I have pretty much bought this case for my last three phones. Its a great case but compared to some of the other phones it doesn't fit the S4 as well. And the screen protector is worthless. With it the menu and back buttons don't work.  Take that off and it's a decent case.,neutral
"that's a great product, but the volumen level is poor, and it's an battery eater, so, you have to buy a Ni batterys.",neutral
"Basically this item is okay... I was dissaponted that there isnt surround sound when it's just the tv on...probably my fault for not looking close at the item. Sound is good no hissing etc, other than stated above it's a good system",neutral
"plugs into the computer and works like a champ. Not very ergonomic, and you have to push a little harder than you'd want to to click it. And when all you do with this device is click &#8211; have to push a little harder than you want really starts to know you after a while. and you feel it more leverage wise because of the flatter design of this mouse. I have no alternative wireless mouse to recommend.",neutral
"Could not get the captured video to playback, do not know if it is the Macbook or the micro camera?",neutral
Wish i look around more instead of purchasing this. A year later and its still going strong but i paid too much for this.,neutral
"I'm not picky.  I just want decent sound.  I don't care about the highs and lows, I don't care about a rich bass, but these sound and feel cheap (duh). You get what you pay for. At least I won't worry about ruining my ""good"" clip ons.",neutral
"This little speaker is easy to pack, and does work as advertised. it was easy to sync to multiple devices. The battery life is good, at least so far. It doesn't have great base, which you would expect from something so small and light, but it works better than the built in speakers on the devices I use most. It is about what I would have expected for the cost- You are not getting Bose sound out of this.",neutral
"I was looking to use this as a repeater to extend my wireless signal so I could use my laptop, I pad, I phone etc in my backyard. I set it up as a repeater and placed it in a window. It works but the signal will drop out every now and again making streaming music  a bit of a problem. I really wish the wireless signal was stronger.",neutral
Ordered these cables because of monsters name which usually means some pretty heavy duty cables.  I was very disappointed when I got these opened the package and they felt like cheaper RCA's you would buy at Wal-mart.  I actually ended up returning them back to amazon and getting a pair from local stereo shop.,neutral
"I was able to pick up some stations but only in one room of the house which wasn't the room I needed. So I returned it. Looking at a couple other options but in Alaska, an outdoor antenna might be the only option that works.",neutral
"This is my fault for not reading all the find details...if they were there.  I purchased this to add external hard drives to it....when it arrived I see that it states do not add external hard drives.....so now have added a card reader, and magic jack.....  wish I could use it for external hard drives.....  so therefore a rating of OK....and that information should be stated clearly and boldly.....",neutral
"helps keep the battery charged up on my daughters tablet, but she doesn't use it that much, it is too cumbersome for her.",neutral
"It's a cheap budget case, so that's what you get.The front ports pretty much died instantly.  Line in and out both give off crazy loud ringing through Skype.  Had to switch and use the box ports.It's spacey.  The fans aren't really high quality  Had small issues fitting an ATX board but it worked fine once it was in.I would only buy if you really have to.  Cheap is cheap.",neutral
Pros: These are great if you have difficulty finding ear buds that fit your ears (even one ear as opposed to the other).Cons: They pop off the headphones far too easily.  I have had to dig through my bag to chase down a rogue earbud more often than not.,neutral
"A bit too small and VERY slow, but was a great value when I purchased two of them. Hard to get a hold of when plugged into my computer. I needed to tie a string on it to pull it out.",neutral
"I bought this as a gift for my wife who hated the windshield mount.  It sits well in her Lexus SUV but I worry about its stability in an accident.  Like I said, it does what it is supposed to do.",neutral
"This is Microsoft's attempt to copy Apple's Magic Mouse. I agree with the previous reviewers.  It is clunky in implementation. I hope Microsoft doesn't end up killing its mice like it is killing its ergonomic keyboards.Microsoft makes the best keyboards but their latest designs are bad.With keyboards and mice, sometimes you don't need to fix what isn't broken.",neutral
"It works well, but I had to get a former fireman that was a communications officer to program it for me. it also has a more limited range than a desk type scanner.",neutral
"The image quality, especially around the edges suffers, but because of there small size compared to carrying a lens, leave them in the back pack, and if the need is there, better than nothing.",neutral
"Requires menu access to switch inputs.  If you own more than one computer NEVER buy a monitor without a dedicated input selection button.Has several video inputs, but only ONE upstream USB input, making it impossible to use monitor input selection as KVM switch.",neutral
"they are jumpers not much to say here, they are made fine and should last me for the duration of the projects I have planned.",neutral
"Over time, it got dirty and reduced the quality of the pictures.  So I eventually took it off and am now just using the iPod without a screen protector (just have to be more careful).  The screen protector provided good protection, though.  No problems with scratches.",neutral
After a couple of months of use the button to turn the lazer on broke but i called the company that made it and there repairing it.,neutral
"I got this because it can use disposable and universal AA batteries, bit is too bulky and heavy for hikers who count every once of weight.",neutral
Not sure about these or the HDMI splitter I bought earlier.  This one seems to work with RCA cables. But I will give this product the benefit of the doubt.,neutral
"Its got a nice design, but don't expect the best zipper... The handle fell off the zipper on the first pull, nothing a pair of pliers couldn't fix though.",neutral
"It item it's not bad considering the price.The item description wasn't clear and specific that the item is only for the pad. If you use your transformer prime with the docking station, this item is not suitable.For the rest, it seems made good. I don't know how long it will last.",neutral
"The product is awesome, sounds great, connects easy and the two alarms are perfect. The condition of the clock/Radeo was not as described and not shown in a photo which would have given me a better idea of exactly what I was buying. Not 100% happy since it was a Christmas pressent for my wife.",neutral
"The sound quality was just &#34;meh&#34;.  My daughter LOVED them, though, because they are too stinkin' cute.  However, one side went out (unless you finagle with the plug-in) with two months.  They have now been thrown away.",neutral
I fell apart pretty quickly. The edges which hold the iPad in place broke one at a time. This is a good cover if you don't handle your iPad much.,neutral
"This BD player works very well and was a great bargain since it was included in a package when I purchased my Aquos LC 42D85U.  The user interface seems a little slow, otherwise it is just fine.",neutral
"Documentation was useless.  Meter didn't move with the signal, and I don't know if that means the meter is defective, or the signal not strong enough.  But, the audiot signal emitted when the dish was aligned help me quickly get up and running.  Well worth it.  Just needs better documentation.",neutral
Not a big fan of this one.  It has trouble balancing the flip with its offcenter tripod mounting hole.,neutral
"We like this product and the effects that it gives our bar area.  However, the controls are not easy to understand and you have to unplug it to turn it off.  I put a lamp switch in the power cord as a fix.",neutral
"works as well as a SD card can i guess, but its not 64gb its (59.45GB) not like it really is all that big a deal but i just found it strange.",neutral
"I bought this for my Toshiba L455 15.6"" screen laptop. I knew it was going to be a tight fit before I bought this; I liked the design too much to pass it up. It's a tight fit, but it does fit. This case only holds my laptop though: There is no room for the power cord. But I'm not complaining. I eventually got a bigger laptop bag from my mother and have no need for this case anymore.",neutral
"Decent case, bought a few for my phone broke after a few days. The one for my ipod didn't fit, wrong gen Probably wouldn't buy again.",neutral
Decent sound - doesn't come with a power supply so you need a A USB power source/ Iphone charger or something similar to power if using a phone to play music.,neutral
"I purchased this card for my Archos 10.1 internet tablet. The item delivered in a oversize DHL envelope. Upon opening, the only thing I see is a teeny-weeny microsd card in a plastic container. The envelope itself is 20x the size of the microsd. Why can't they pack it in a better container.",neutral
"The remote itself is very flimsy, and the rubbery buttons tend to &#34;stick&#34;.  Build quality is suspect as well; I can't imagine it lasting for a long time. Thankfully I don't plan to use it, and only needed the IR receiver.",neutral
"Although plastic, it is well designed. However, it does not work in my laptop, fujitsu LH530. I ended up giving up to add another hard drive and set back to my old one.",neutral
"Works as described, but the menu setup is cumbersome, and I wish I had bought the model with a USB hookup in the back on the radio.",neutral
"Excellent for the price, but not quite enough oomph to drive speakers instead of headphones. I was asking it to do something it was not designed to do, perhaps.Also sounded a little rolled off in the trebles; a bit muted and indistinct overall. Nonetheless, it beat an old Yamaha amp in terms of warmth and depth of soundstage.",neutral
I really like this product but I've found that my Apple batteries that came with the device work better and longer than it,neutral
"Just like my title says, it helps with focus a little bit.  But it's nothing compared to the good old split focusing screens.  Why can't someone make one for Canon 5d?  I would buy that thing in an instant.",neutral
"The picture shows a chip density of 16 chips.  The actual density is 8 chips.  That's an important distinction in an HP laptop.  It won't work in a Pavilion if the original SODIMM's have a chip density of 16 chips.  It's not a problem with the memory, just the product picture is fatally misleading.  Had to return and get Kingston 16-chip modules.",neutral
"I used this to hook up DVD player with my old SANYO TV. Cable signal also go through it to TV. Before I use it, the TV signal is clear. After I used it, signal of some, not all, channels became noisy with rolling stripes.",neutral
It works wonderfully. The only thing that disappointed me was the usb able that it came with is quite short. Only about a 1 foot long.,neutral
My old dell dimension 4300 finally gave up the ghost. I used it as a network file server with 3 old ide hard disk drives. New PC's only have SATA connections so I bought this to transfer my old data to a new 3tb external drive. It works as expected and I was able to save the data from all three drives.,neutral
"I purchased this walkman to listen to talk radio and some music while I putz around or workout.  Don't bother with this Sony if you plan on moving around.

"I have to agree with the Mizar,Cons- poorly designed- very uncomfortable- Key are very uneasy to access- Why the function keys are so small?- you probably may never get use these function keys- No keystroke soundPros+ Works with my PS3!+ Slim design is a plus+ (Not much, it works and I can type something)+ (I got it for free, Someone gifted me this ;) )",neutral
"The size is less than 15 GB, I was expecting it to be at least 15 for it's a 16GB. Instead I get just a bit over 14GB overall the price is cheap.",neutral
"Kinda flimsy but works well with a very small camera and attachment (light, mic, etc.)",neutral
Considering the cost benefit I guess I can say the product is OK. You get what you paid for so no issues.,neutral
"I have had it for a month & a half and doesn't seem to be holding up to well with minimal use, starting to fray a bit. After owning this case I realize I should have took the advice of some other owner's reviews & bought a better case.",neutral

This is just too difficult to get operational for the average person. The instructions are worthless. Not fully baked in my opinion.,neutral
"This FM transimitter works better than the iTrip I got before. The quality still depends on many factors including where you live, how is the weather outside, and so on. If you can get a direct AUX connection with your car, just do that. Use FM transmitter as a last resort to listening to your iPod in your car.",neutral
"I bought this particular charger because it would be easy to carry with me--and in terms of its size, it is. However, it fits so flush to the socket and, moreover, fits so snugly, that it's almost impossible to get it out with your bare hands. That severely limits its portability.",neutral
"Got this product as a free offer in a combo deal with Asus laptop. It took a while to connect the laptop and the TV and netgear adapter.

Used it once to test it, there is a lag in cursor movement (as compared to on the laptop screen). Its lying in storage now, not being used.",neutral
This is good for protection but it changes the clarity of your screen.  I really would prefer something clear. I'll probably try another brand.,neutral
Come on Logitech haven't you raked enough cash in these last ten years to provide your consumers with a software title for your wonderful camera? NO. Really? Ok last logitech camera I buy.,neutral
"Lightweight and easy to apply, non-intrusive, fits the iPod like a glove. Nothing fancy or anything, I actually like cases that have a little more bulk to them, but most people like to keep their media players as light and compact as possible. This works for those purposes.",neutral

We bought it for son's birthday but he wasn't that fond of it.  He gave it to a friend he likes other brands better,neutral
"Does what its supposed to. I use this with my Nikon D7000 and works as good as the Nikon branded remote but for $2 versus $20 dollars just use this and save up for a good prime lens, something that will help your photography.",neutral
Scratched up my screen and wasn't easy to put on at all. I returned it and I'm still looking for a viewfinder loupes. Woe is me.,neutral
I would give this higher reviews because it works fine for photography but do NOT buy this for DSLR video acquisition.It most certainly does not work with the Canon c100 or c300 professional cameras.,neutral
"I bought the sleeve and returned it the same day.  It cost less, but you get what yo pay for. the quality is so-so- no liner not nothing, but if money it the issue it would work.The 13.3 did not fit my laptop, so you like the product get the next size up.",neutral
This is a very basic recorder.  It doesn't record in HD.  The menus are clunky and confusing until you get used to them.  It has no tuner so you can't record one show and watch another.  It's certainly no PVR.  But the price is right.,neutral

This thing is priced right.  The container is too small for you to just &#34;throw the stuff into.&#34;  You have to neatly plan out how you'll manage the space.  The clips could fit much better.,neutral
Appears to do the trick for being able to charge my camera batteries in the car on the run.  Overall okay for the price paid.,neutral
"These buds are not the best of quality. The microphone is HORRIBLE the button jus activates the voice control and then deactivates  it so it is completely useless. The bud replacements are good. There are four which are decent. The wire is weird. it is coated in rubber so it doesn't fold easily. and when you walk it makes a noise, so not great for running.

"These are not near what you pay for, save your money and but the other sony premiums, My CANON XL1S Eats these just as well as the others for a fraction of the cost,,,,",neutral
This case is much thinner then anything out there.  If you are buying a case for true protection from drops then I wouldn't advise this one.  There is no internal padding and the neoprine sleeve is thin material.  I just wanted something that would protect my macbook air when it's traveling in my carry-on bag.  This works just fine.,neutral
I bought four of these 3TB drives. The first two arrived and I formatted them to ext4 without a hitch.The second two failed to format and bricked up. Now they will not even appear as devices to try to fix.Call it 2.5 stars on average and 0 overall.,neutral
"This antenna doesn't do too bad... Pulls in relatively close stations well. The only complaint I have concerns where the cable exists the unit.

"As other reviewers have noted, this flash softbox doesn't really stay in position very well on its own; I find I have to hold it up manually for it to stay upright. I'd surely be happier with a more robust solution, but I don't use on-camera flash much at all, and for the price, I can't complain.",neutral
"I was very pleased with the sound quality of these speakers, and found that they indeed captured the music very well. As far as musical quality goes, they indeed enhanced my listening. Nonetheless, there are headsets with equally good or better quality available for considerably less, and I did not see a degree of performance which would justify the high price.",neutral
"After first, these headphones are superb. They are clean as hell, and seem to have a wide range. After a month or so, the bass driver of the left channel totally died. It caused an annoying imbalance in the sound, and I had to get rid of them.",neutral
"I have tried a few of these out, and I only had one disc so far that came out bad.  The rest have worked as expected.  So why did I rate it 3 stars? Well because there's nothing especially outstanding about these discs either.  They do the job.",neutral
"just does what it's suppose to do, too bad everyone has to have their own ( special ) plug, anything to get more of your money....sucks",neutral
"This unit has really nice sound, but I need to keep the volume down to keep from disturbing others. Since the volume control on this unit is stepped (digital levels) I often find I can't adjust the volume at just the right level. Too low and I can't hear it clearly. The next volume level up is too loud. Still, it is a very nice unit.",neutral
"This works great when it works, but I find it's often the case that I have to play around for a while to find exactly where to aim it to get my camera to register the button press. I've yet to figure out where the infrared receiver is on my Nikon D80, but I find it works most reliably when I'm behind, above, and to the left of the camera.",neutral

"I have tried all of the frequency channels, but the range I get on this is terrible.  I had a Linksys WRT54G sitting in the exact same spot, and it gave me a strong signal everywhere in my house.

"It does function as an anti-glare protector, but it seems that it sometimes inhibits a response to a touch of the screen.

MUCH better sound and something more friendly about the boom mic.,neutral
"Product is a good fit for the camera and made well for the cost, however it could really use a deeper/steeper vertical edge on the grip area - it feels only slightly more 'grippy' than the camera body itself.

It would probably be ok if you just wanted to print 4 x 6 photos without any cropping (ie, not zooming in with your computer).",neutral
These work as they should but have limited use in a professional photography environment as they add superficial blues and too much dark contrast in any setting except for filming on open water or taking bright sunny cloud shots.. - despite any of that- Nikon makes the finest lenses in the world.  - you can never go wrong with a Nikon Camera.,neutral
I was hoping for a sturdy case. These are okay. Probably are fine for storage and less for every day use.Like that you can store 4 DVDs in the space of a single case.,neutral

Once the Liliput unscreen is firmly attached, the Velcro on the ProAm screen does pretty fair job of staying on.So Far I plan on keeping it.",neutral

Pros: a 8GB microSDHC class 4 (instead of class 2 as advertised)Cons:- does not have the SD adapter as advertised (it has a reader instead)- the bulk package consists of 1 microSDHC card and 1 microSD reader. The reader is unusable on win 7 (can not detect the device's driver),neutral
Big storage space and proper price. However it cannot reach 40MB/s. Only about SDHC Class 10 speed. I'd recommend cards made by Sandisk instead.,neutral

"I don't know it if it's worth 250. It's good. I may consider some others; I think it needs a subwoofer. In fact, the Vizio soundbar that kept blowing out sounded better and it was only 100, so like I said, it's good, not great, but good. 3.5 half stars.",neutral
"Sound, comfort and portability are good.  One of the earcups broke off. I don't think I'd buy again unless it was $3 or less.",neutral
"Worked well and couldn't beat the price. I was just a bit put off by an odorous smell that the chemicals in the case put off.

Overall love this product. Can't say the same for the build quality. Used it for several weeks before the corner broke off.

"So I had last year's version, and it worked quite well. This year's model has the new UI. I'm not sure if it's the UI or the hardware, but this year's model is significantly more buggy than last year's. Sometimes I'll catch it turning on out of the corner of my eye. It'll turn on for an hour then turn itself off. Very annoying because the remote is IR, so you can't hide it behind other things.",neutral
"The thing works fine. It does come with cables. The wrong kind. I had to go out and buy an HDMI cable. I had to spend a few hours online trying to research why the picture quality looked so bad - I needed a cable. The manufacturer should put an HD cable in with the DVD player, which is intended to be plugged into an HDTV.",neutral

"These speakers crapped out on me- sound got scratchy and then later it just produced static sound at 20% of the original volume. It's not very practical or convenient either.

"Decent kit and has everything you need to start. My problem was with the provided power supply, it says 1 amp but when I plug in a  keyboard and the wireless module, the pi shuts down and restarts with either one of the components not functioning.

This case did not fit the Lumix LF1 camera even though Amazon said it would fit slim Lumix cameras.  It arrived on time and was genuine Panasonic merchandise - just dissapointing that the camera is too big for the case snap to work properly.,neutral
I received this item very quickly and the length of the cable was great for the price.  However this cable is seemingly not shielded and had awful interference when trying to use it.  It may work for you but YMMV.,neutral

Moshi iVisor XT (HD clear) No-Bubble Screen Protector for Kindle Fire HD is an OK item. Love the ease that it installed with. The only thing that could make this better would be if it were non-glare.,neutral

It is smaller than other brand. Nice looking adopter but my internet phone has static when it connected to the adopter.,neutral
"This hood is decent for the price.  I am using it on my Canon 75-300mm telephoto kit lens.  It doesn't fit as securely as I would like (meaning that if you turn it too far, it clicks) but it won't fall off.  It does feel a bit flimsy, but for 5 bucks, you can't go wrong with this product.",neutral

I like our system but there is something missing in the sound.  Watching TV shows versus movies.  Either the conversations are too loud and the background noise isn't (doesn't match) or vice versa.  It's hard to get it to work right for me and the auto tuning feature is all but useless IMHO.They're cheap and maybe that was my mistake.  I don't trust CNET anymore after they're review.,neutral

Short term solution before I upgrade my stock stereoSound quality is like your native radio stations, not great but not bad...again...$6, whatcha expect?",neutral
"The sound quality isn't very good, they sound like a less expensive set of headphones, very muffled sounding.

Used it for a couple of months and replaced it with an Otterbox. The case is better than nothing. It just didn't feel like it would offer any protection in the event of a drop.,neutral
"For this price, design could be improved by providing a fitting cap at the negative end instead of having a majority of users resort to aluminum foils etc.  Otherwise, it is too short - I almost feel like returning it because it does not really do what it is supposed to do - a D spacer.  I think the C-spacers are still reasonable but for a proper D-spacer,  you need a proper protruding cap at the negative end.",neutral
"Not that I expected too too much, but they are what they are expected to be. Decent little headphones with ok sound for an ok price.",neutral

"I haven't had to utilize this warranty yet, but already I'm not happy about the fact that the warranty begins the day of purchase before the laptop has even arrived.

"Im a bit disappointed. The &#34;built in screen protector&#34; was loose inside the package and not glued ito position when it arrived. I was able to line it back up and press it back into place. Not bad, but not perfect. Cheaper than the name brand one. I would buy one again, but I hope that they improve the overall quality of the product.",neutral
I think it works pretty well... I guess my only complaint is it's kind of bulky.  Takes up a lot of counter or shelf space.,neutral
"I have been using this camera for about 1 year.  Some of the problems with this camera is1) Lens cap doesn't stay on the lens, it always falls down.

It worked perfectly fine with my Dj software when i used the sound card. it comes in handy and its small and compact. i would recommend to handle the sound card with care because it's made by no so durable plastic.,neutral
Pros:1) Nice look2) Fix tablet in 3 different angles3) Easy access to all ports and cameraCons:1) No pockets at all2) Its hard to close and open it - I'm afraid to brake the tablet since it very stiff,neutral
"It has a good display. The design could be better. It has a very basic menu for configuration. When setting the language to spanish, it really displays messages in both spanish and french. Doesn't autoscale pics. Good option if you just want a basic frame with a big screen. If you want more than that, you should consider another frame.",neutral
You get what you pay for. I got it for my son because he keeps messing on my iPad. This is not a product I would use but it works for him.,neutral
"Sound quality is okay but not great. These are great for the stationary listener. If you run in these, walk in these, move at all they will fall off. I traded these in for earbuds when those became a thing.",neutral

"Provides a lot of protection for a kid.  Makes it almost impossible to plug in the charger or head phones while in the case.  I probably would have gone for something a little less bulky.

The fit isn't as good as other Stofen units I have and I find it comes off to easily but the quality of the light is worth the effort.,neutral
"This is a knockoff of the Manfrotto and is not up to their standards, but works adequately. I particularly like the various plastic inserts that change the jaws to fit different shapes. Very handy.

"I bought this to pair with my desk phone and my iPhone.  Setup was easy.  The device works perfectly.  My only complaint is comfort.  If you're on a call for longer than 10 minutes, this thing is rough on your ear.  I've tried all of the supplied eargels and both earhooks, but it still hurts.  The over the head style holder is comfortable, but is not a very portable or subtle option.",neutral
"It's really just okay. I'm a case-junkie (I love to change my cases depending on my mood) so I mainly got this one because of the bright blue, but when it arrived, it wasn't that bright of a blue. Still pretty but not exactly what I was hoping for. The card slots are nice but there are other cases with card slots for a third of the price so not sure this one's worth it.",neutral

I enjoy using the Canon Wireless Remote Control RC1. The only drawback is that it is a line-of-sight controller and it needs to be in front of the camera to operate properly. The Canon radio control remote is more handy and can operate from behind the camera and for greater distances... but the radio control remote cost more.,neutral
Have been looking for this for a long time.  It's really convenient but it takes up up another USB port.  It would have been great if this could be attached to their keyboard charger.  Also would have been great if you could actually use the mouse while on top of the charger itself.,neutral

These do not fit as comfortably as I would like - the right piece won't stay in my ear no matter which cover I put on it.  The left piece fits fine.  Since only one side fits the resulting sound is awkward and too much outside noise infiltrates the set.,neutral

This thing is made so you must completely unwrap the cord every time you use it.  I have a 50 foot 16 gauge cord and it fits comfortably.  It is made almost entirely out of plastic and you must keep weight in it during the roll/unroll process.  can't beat the price and it is easier than rolling the cord around my arm every time.,neutral

I saw this and was very happy someone finally created what I thought was an obvious need in the industry. I ordered it and realized it would not work on my F mount cameras.

"These are for the casual gamer. If you really enjoy gaming, i'd suggest getting a custom controller like the one woodys gamer tag. Kids get into these and the buttons get sticky.

If you use the xbox for netflix more than gaming, then you should get the remote control style controller.",neutral

I found the thickness of the cable to a big disappointment. I would expect better from Nikon.

Not much to say for this other than it fits the tablet well. Good protection. Can be better if there are specific pockets to put the stylus and other accessories.,neutral
Good deal on batteries and charger. The car charger cable is VERY cheap. I just hope it lasts. That is one of the main reasons I purchased this item.

Not great but OK. Have to be in front of the camera to use it.Works great for getting yourself into the pictures but not so much for time laps or any other shot where you want to be behind or to the side of the camera.I'd say it has about a 20-25' range when pointing it at the front of the camera,neutral

"I really don't see why Amazon doesn't include this with the Kindle reader. It really isn't reasonable to expect everyone to have a computer available all the time to charge the reader.

"My canon 35-80 and 70-300 swim in these bags.  The length options are good, but I find the the interior diameter a little too large.Pros:  Keeps my lenses from beating themselves up in the bag, good assortment of lengths, cheap.Cons:  Interior diameter is too large, which takes up extra space in in my already crowded bag.  The material around the opening does not stretch.",neutral

"Bought these and realized that I made a mistake. I wanted a few extra light stands for some LED video lights I have but these are not easy to slide up or down, legs and pole are all tubular with plastic locking mechanism.

"No fault of the filter.. there's no good alternative method to attach other than standing proud with a sticky backing.  Too bad the lens doesn't have a recessed step to allow flush fit, so will just have to wait and see how long it lasts. Quality wise, it looks fine.",neutral
I can't say how well it protects because I did not use it once I received it and read the instructions for applying it.  I had mistakenly thought it was removeable and I did not wish to place anything on my iPad permanently. I did not return it due to the cost of return postage.,neutral
Got mine in the mail but one of the buttons to release the cable was missing. So unplugging is a pain. But I'm not overly concerned about it.,neutral

I love hot pink and I always buy cases/phones/tabs/cameras in that color if available.This case is made of plastic and it covers front and back of your ipod touch.The problem is that the paint used to color this case will definitely stain your hands and textiles when new.After that you will have a faded pink color case.It's ok but you can find better.,neutral

It is good for the price but as others have said it is very difficult to get on the tablet.  It actually required a knife to be able to get some of the rubber pulled out though the openings.  Even once it was in you can see it busting at the seams so it's not quite the right fit.,neutral

Other than the picture being a little on the dark side. It is a good TV for the price. I spent quite a bit of time adjusting the picture and never got to a point where I said.. &#34;The picture looks great!&#34;  That being said.

So the title says all the good things about it now for quality don't expect too much. If you are a kind of hard-core kind of user(like me) don't buy this one. It is not so comfortable neither the clicks sound like high tech. Buy a good mouse - buy a Logitech.,neutral

Its strange that it worked fine for weeks and one day the radio failed. rebooting did not fix it so I had to do a factory reset which fixed the issue. If for some reason it gets factory reset then it causes a broadcast storm in the network and slows everything down.,neutral

For the price you can't go wrong.  Just don't expect it to hold up to heavy use like the Canon battery because it can't.

My zen does not recognize this but it does charge. My daughter's zen doesn't recognize it and it does not charge at all for hers. It is probably a crap shoot as to whether or not it will work for you but it does work on the one. The only problem is that I am afraid it will over charge it.,neutral

If you use the device while charging I'd look elsewhere; probably for one from Apple.",neutral

"We purchased this, but ss another consumer pointed out, we &#34; felk&#34; for the ARC model; otyerwise the same save for the 'endorsement' from the ARC on the unit.The primary issue, initially, was that we solar-charged the unit, and that virtually melted the red &#34;cushiony&#34; rubberized case such that it is gummy to the touch, and useless.  And, it worked sporadically, in spite of consulting a battery manufacturer.I would not try this product again.",neutral

"This cable works as intended. The other smaller adapter port is so that you can charge your iPad while using the VGA connection.  I think the price is to high on this cable, just like other Apple cables. However, the Apple build quality is great, so that makes the pain a bit less.",neutral
Keep the lint off of this cover because it is challenging to get off. So be careful of wrapping the camera in a towel or anything like that while carrying it in a bag.,neutral

"I bought this product based on its Amazon review, but was disappointed after used it for 1 day.

These ear buds do the job adequately.  They don't fit my ears as well as iPod ones but you get what you pay for.,neutral
I don't really use this because it's not as useful as I thought it would be. I think it's smarter to own a decent pair of earbuds than to try to turn your iPod into something it's not.,neutral

This could have made it to the excellent mark with a little more effort.Seems the ideal all day lens to keep.

The quality of the aftermarket screen does not match that of the OEM. But the price is right and I'm not watching HD videos on my iPod anywho.

This camera is just OK.  It is only a minor step above a point and shoot camera.  The body does not include a focus motor and will not work with many of my older lenses.

I am trying to weight the pros and cons of the screen protector with the new iPad. I like the fact that it's matte and doesn't leave fingerprints but it really ruins the beautiful retina display.

"Ordered this lens hood for Canon's 55-250mm zoom.  It goes on and stays on, doing its job, but it doesn't seem to be the greatest fit.  It doesn't click into place or anything, more just like you twist it on until it binds enough to stay put.  So it seems very cheap, but technically it works.Also, you'll need a center pinch lens cap for your lens if you want to use it without taking this off each time.",neutral

I had a very difficult time keeping the earbuds in my ears.  My ear openings aren't that small.  I'd say they're average in size and these earbuds kept falling out.  Could be because they're flat rather than being cone shaped or having different sizes to fit the different size ears. I just found them difficult to use.  The best thing I liked about them is the in-line volume control.,neutral

I prefer the behind the head and not around the neck style.",neutral
"Good: It's cheap and very confortable (specially because it comes with 3 different sizes rubber covers).  Since you can choose the rubber which better adapts to your ears, besides being confortable it also provides some isolation.Bad: It's really nothing more than that.  It's 19 bucks headphone and this is exactly what you get, nothing more.  It's very fragile, the sound is regular (nothing really special) and the ""Noise Reducing"" is solely due to mechanical isolation.",neutral

These headphones sound great but if you're using either the coaxial or optical digital inputs it only decodes 2.0 (stereo) not 5.1.  This means they won't work with most high end television sets.  In order to get them to work you have to spend another $100 for a 5.1 digital to stereo converter box.,neutral
I bought this screen protectors for a Contixo tablet 10.1&#34;. They protect the tablet but I had to cut those because they are bigger than the tablet.

I bought this for my daughters computer. It was fairly inexpensive and the camera does not move easily. Don't be fooled by how the camera is mounted on the bracket.

Mouse was smaller than expected.  Size is the most important feature of a mouse.  This was not given in the description.  Why is it always left out?Size:  3.75 X 2.5 X 1.5I would consider this somewhere between Medium and SmallIt is cheap and no big loss if it is lost.,neutral

This is a good charging system. Does what it intended to do and the charge last for a good while. Only bad thing about it is you have too remove the wrist strap in order for the wii remote to fit on the charger which really sucks.,neutral
At $10 these are not a good buy. I know these cost 20 cents to manufacture. They don't hold to the Sony headphones very well. I used a couple small pieces of electricity tape to hold them in place which worked but looks kind of ghetto.,neutral

I'm not a professional. And I suppose if you bump up your ISO and aperture you maybe able to use these lights however I found them under powered.

I guess I underestimated the measurements because this case is considerable bigger than I thought. I was hoping for a smaller case that I could pack and carry in a small backpack. It's a little too big for that... It would be best for just putting it away in a drawer with all of the cables and extras in the same place.,neutral
The problem is that the iPad mini is &#34;too thin&#34;. Because the case does wrap around be base adequately it has nothing to hold onto when placed in your hands. Not really Incipio's fault but not an easy case to use on a regular basis.,neutral
I just threw it in a drawer.  I guess sometime I'll find a camera I want that it will work in.,neutral
Perhaps I misunderstood but I thought these were the same size as the $19.99 pads.These are longer and narrower  and don't fill out the ear canal as much as the other model. I guess if you have long narrow ear canals these will work but I've got big one (ear canals).,neutral

"Be cautious with this enclosure.  It's not exactly sturdy-built.  The 2 screws that attach the SATA-USB connection/conversion to the enclosure are maybe 3mm long.  Not exactly sturdy.

So I would not recommend storing anything of vital importance on whatever drive you put in this enclosure.",neutral

I am annoyed that the price of this item was reduced from $20.17 to $11.75. I purchased at the higher price just about three weeks ago and now it is a lot cheaper. The shipping costs to Australia were quite high so it is not worth returning it.The new price better reflects the quality of the product.Disappointing that Amazon has done this.,neutral
This is a decent speaker system for this price point. I did not get any distortion at loud volumes. And it is loud enough to fill up a small hall.,neutral
I just wanted something that I could swap from bag to bag and this works fine. It's a nylon wallet with velcro. My only issue is that over time it puts an odd film on the filters. Not sure what it's from but I might be looking for something different if I can't figure it out.,neutral
I wanted to connect multiple USB devices and some of them need charge but I was sadly faced with the fact that this device needs a power source in order to charge any device that is connected.

This product is okay for what you pay for. i had to use my own rubber parts to get it to fit my sb-800's or sb-700. Light will leak from the top part because it is made of paper inside and it will cause a color shift for which you will need to w/b for. Dont expect miracles.,neutral
The plastic piece on the adapter is obviously made from cheap materials and it feels like it can break any minute.

Pros:Easy to assemble.Not too heavy.Sturdy construction.Cons:Bulky.Instructions are garbage.bolts are not long enough to accommodate larger wood posts.Very frustrating in tight spots.Overall this is a decent mount. It is somewhat frustrating in tighter spots and I had to use longer u-bolts in order to make it fit where i wanted it to go. All in all it got the job done and is a decent price.,neutral
I didn't expect much from a lens that is not much more than a pin hole.  The picture quality is marginal.  It is better than no lens if you need to grab the body and take a picture but don't expect a shap picture.  My cell phone does much better.  I will keep it because it was not that expensive but my use will be in emergancies only.,neutral

"One of the reasons I bought this was that the pictures showed it holding a tablet in portrait orientation. I have a Tab2 (P5113) and it will only hold the tablet in landscape. Other than that, it seems fine. It paired easily and, as a screen cover, it fits well.",neutral

I didn't rate it any lower as it might be fine some someone else but there was no way it would fit on the back of my Samsung.

I got this to supplement the airflow in my case since I was going to be doing some 24/7 cryptocoin mining. I wasn't worried about noise so much but got this since it was advertised as silent.

I did not want to render them un-sell-able.",neutral
Comfortable but do not cancel outside noises.,neutral
"Its ok, could be louder. The rotary volume knob is nice. Kinda always have to take it easy with the music, which stinks. Even with the bass turned down it still gets bogged down and choppy. Cant remember what I paid but $20 bucks seems like a appropriate price point, no more - too many other options that might not cut out at anything other than unreasonably low volumes.",neutral
Pretty good product. Worked for about 3 months until I accidentally bumped it with my coffee table and the cheap screw-on connector broke off. About the same quality you'd find for a little more expensive at Wal-mart. I'll probably just go to Wal-mart next time.,neutral

This card works fine for my media center computer connected to a 55in 1080p HDTV via HDMI.  Video and audio quality are good with HDTV in windows media center.

I was looking forward to this unit. Have had lots of Sony devices over the years and they usually pack a lot punch in small packages. But I was disappointed with this unit. The Bass was anemic. When you enabled their synthetic bass boost. The Midrange disappeared !! The Bose Sound Link II blew it away.,neutral
But too small even for my Nikon L820.  There is like a drawer/cradle inside which makes the case smaller than it really is.,neutral

I bought this device because I had a previous device from Anker that was flawless. This iteration makes a shrill erratic sound when a device is plugged in and charging.

"These cans look great.  They sound good and the buttons are easy to find by feel but the fact that the batteries are not replaceable, did hold charge but 4-5 hours and could not be used when charging turned me off.  Returned them and went to Sennheisers.",neutral
The design itself is great. I love that it turns any laptop/desktop hard drive (even cd drives including blu-ray) into a usb unit.

This sub is pretty but hollow sounding. It produces resonance and boomy bass even at moderate volume.

If you want to replace your factory speakers these are ok.but if you wants them for a system these are not for you.they cant handle 150 watts rms like they claim.,neutral

It works good but the outer rim is to thin and if it isn't super flush it seems to rub on its own frame. My Azza case has dust guards and this throws the frame out a little and it rubs very annoyingly.,neutral

"The quality was good, my only drawback is that it didn't accept files from the PC.  It will send files TO the PC, but not accept them FROM the PC.  Therefore I sent mine back and upgraded",neutral

"Bought this to replace a broken ""car tunes"" fm mod. This one sounds thick and dull by comparison.

A little super glue seemed to fix the problem, but I am still not 100% confident that it will hold up.",neutral
"Nice little gadget to have. The only improvement I heard is the bass boost function. Other then that, not much sound improvement really.",neutral
It worked for about 3 months then broke. But you can't beat the price. I don't see anything but a SD card fitting in it but I didn't try.,neutral
There are certainly faster USB drives out there than this.  But its pretty cheap and gets the job done.  I use it primarily for home use.,neutral
"It's nice, however it does skip letters on the keyboard.  and has no lanyard for convenient obtaining out of pocket. I am still comparing it to the older one I have, so, check with me in a month or so.",neutral
"I bought this battery for my 60D. The package was nice and it arrived promptly. However it is not compatible with my charger. My OEM canon charger will not charge this battery. I have tried several times to no avail. There is a good possibility that I just got a bad battery, but I think I will stick to OEM batteries from here on out.",neutral
Lightweight but inexpensive for this size. Not very good for horizontal ceiling applications. Tends to sag downwards. Would only use again if I need to use on a vertical wall application.,neutral
"Item works as advertised, but it is cheaply made and very light/top heavy.  The fan is 'soft blade' and thus pushes very little air.  The light works fine. Depending on where you intend to use, it may be just what you're looking for, but keep your expectations in line.",neutral

"I was hoping for better. I've had pretty good luck with Coby products before including a DVD player that I've used for years. The main problem with the radio is a lack of selectivity-stations bleed on top of one another. Also, the radio has poor filtering allowing extraneous noise to come through. If the station is strong neither of these flaws is a problem. The tuning mechanism works great, and the sound quality (of strong stations) is fine.",neutral

Pros:1. Nice looking.2. Hides cables well.Cons:1. Front of shelf tilts noticeably toward floor. Had to put some washers in the bottom of shelf to level it up.2. Unstable. Tilts side-to-side after installation.3. Shelf could be a little larger. My components sit on or very near the edge.4. Poor instructions.It's too bad that the mechanical design of the shelf doesn't match the aesthetic quality. A few minor changes and this would be a 5 star item.,neutral
"As this is an Apple product, I assumed this was going to be the same case as one previously purchased, just a different color.  I was wrong.  This case is slightly larger-but, does fit the iPad.

For the price it's not bad.  The graphics are nice and the sound is good.  Wish it were a little more finger print resistant.,neutral

I like the player; it has good sound and lots of features. Battery life is decent. The Media Go software created by Sony is flashy but I found it to be very slow in synchronizing the device. Other options (like winamp or wmp are much faster).  After about a year the volume buttons on the side stopped working though.,neutral
"The seller is great - very fast ship.The transmitter itself is very cheaply made and the power adapter plug breaks after the first use. As a FM transmitter, it is the same as any other - passable as best, but no complaints there. Do not expect audiophile sound because none of these units can deliver that..",neutral
"Yes would recommend if you don't mind it being in the hot shoe of your camera, I'am just not sure if it interferes with the contacts of the camera and what effect it will have on the camera.",neutral
Sound is OK.  Does its job.  I would rather has spent the money on the zKicker.  Remote is ok and has everything to run output to tv.,neutral
"Not having much experience with nice cameras, I just bought this on a whim, and it's ok but doesn't really do much shielding. It's pretty short, and I didn't know how well it would fit, so it was kind of a waste of money, but better than nothing I suppose.",neutral

"The wide angle will not work on an G12, Canon dosn't even offer a wide lens that will work on this camera, no one at this time does. The telephoto and hood work great and are worth the price.",neutral
The only draw back is size.  It takes up camera bag space. It has a good out put of air and can be useful.,neutral
This probably depends a lot on your paint type but mine kind of comes &#34;unstuck&#34; sometimes. I think it might be when I am messing with the cords and give it a little tug on accident.

"this leather case looks cheaply made but it is very good for protecting your viper remote control.  Those remotes costs over $80 and should protect it.

I was hoping for something a little more solid.  My bad for not reading through more reviews.  The keys feel mushy and don't provide great feedback.  3-stars instead of 1 for the low price (for a wireless keyboard that is).  So if you're not picky it's probably a decent buy.,neutral

"I bought these because for some reason I thought it would be better to have a durable lining.  Chances are, and in my case I didn't, need such a strong cable.

it's allright but can't hold candle to GoPro I'm assuming as I don't own a GoPro yet. The underwater kit that it came with works but the screw on lens is crap and doesn't screw on at all totally suks. Can't fault the seller as they just sell it and it does what it says it does but just not quite the quality I would have liked.,neutral
Certainly better than the FM transmitters since this one links directly between the antenna & the radio but it still requires you tune to a FM station. Is not bad for a low cost solution but I found the gain adjustment was barely adequate and sound quality was just okay. Of course the advantage of having the stock radio is less likely to be a victim of car theft.,neutral
"The price on these is really good.  It arrived in a reasonable amount of time.But, I find that about half of the BD I've burned are corrupted.  So, I end up throwing a lot of them away.",neutral
"Pros:  The case is very thin, and fits the iPad mini very well.  Very slick.Cons:  On the case that I received there appears to be a bubble or something on the front.  This has caused the pattern on the front to not print correctly on a portion of it.  While this will not effect how it works, it is noticeable.  Belkin may want to look into their quality control, so that marred ones like this don't get through.",neutral

It seems like a great camera but the previous reviewer is right about the lens. I liked the feature of the f 1.8 lens for low light situations. The barrel distortion however is awful. I rejected this camera. I was ready to order one and went to Circuit City to look at one.

I now just use standard AA's, but when battery charge falls below ~30%, the mouse starts freezing and skipping. All in all, you can probably do better for the price.",neutral
"Its a basic inexpensive player, so obviously you get what you pay for.  The remote control response is slow when turning on or off, which is why I gave it 3 stars, but its actually made of good quality materials.  One thing to note is that this does NOT have an HDMI port, so the resolution does suffer quite a bit.",neutral

I ended up keeping this item - in spite of the fact that the plastic lever for the mechanism locking the bottom of the screen broke off after two uses.

"This stand is a great value for the price. It is easy to set up and use. It's only major fault is that when you go to pan, the pivot point where the camera attaches to the stand is very stiff and hard to move with a smooth sweeping motion.

The earbuds themselves are comfortable and sound good. I haven't had any issues with signal loss either.  My big complaint though is that they put the ON button exactly where your thumb goes when clipping it onto something.

I bought this to use with my MK808b Android stick. To start with I ordered a k400 but the Seller sent me the newer k400r - and this is not working for me. I had to install the 'Easy' software to get this to run on Windows 8 (64 bit) - but sure enough it did work.I think this is pretty stupid considering this was a recommended purchase by Amazon with the MK808b.Disappointed,neutral
I finally gave up trying to use this mouse as a wireless mouse due to the dismal battery life.  I have the smaller Logitech Anywhere MX mouse and it's awesome with great battery life.  Not sure why it's bigger brother performs so poorly.  You are better off just buying a wired mouse as this one has to stay plugged in most of the time anyway.,neutral
I like the sound from Jbuds - I don't need amazing sound - just good - since I listen to audiobooks with them. My problem with these and other Jbuds I have purchased is their apparent fragility. I am not that hard on these things but they have all quit working on one side. In the future I will spend less and feel better when I have to toss them.,neutral
"For some reason my Alpine head unit stopped charging my iphone 4, so I bought this as a supplemental power source. About 30% of the time when I connect it, the phone says that it is unable to charge with this accessory. Plugging and unplugging a few times usually resolves the issue, but it is pretty annoying. Not 100% sure wether to blame Griffin or Apple though.",neutral
"It is ok for the price you pay. I bought it for my fitness center. Works fine. Fits on my 27 inch Samsung LCD tv, moves freely. If I had to buy for my bedroom, I would probably have bought a litte better (and a little expensive one)!But for this price you can't complain.",neutral

"As with any screen protector, it's time-consuming and frustrating to apply so that it's in just the right position -- I suspect that's why the package includes three, so you can waste one or even two in your attempt to get everything aligned -- a great advantage! An Apple Store genius told me that the protector can make the touch screen a tad less touch sensitive, and I may have noticed that. Still, all in all, it's just fine.",neutral
"I wish these use some kind of detachable fastening mechanism instead of adhesive.  As it is, I have DSLR and 4 different lenses I use regularly and to have 4 different lens caps on the camera is simply not an option.  But if you mostly shoot with one lens, this is a good solution.",neutral
"This is a nice bag but it's a bit ambitious to think you can fit all of the items listed in the website description comfortably. I would say you can fit one small, ungripped DSLR with kit lens or small prime attached, a second lens, and a water bottle (or a flash.) Or just a second and third lens, nothing else. Anything else and you'd be really jamming it in there and probably not able to clip it closed.",neutral
"The price on these is good, and it spite of the seemingly flimsy cord, it seems to be holding up to my daily use so far. I was disappointed to find that the microphone only had an on/off button, which means I have to adjust the volume from the iPhone itself.

this is okay but I wish it was more minimal.  It could be less obtrusive and still provide plenty of support,neutral

With this cable in the path the software recognized the camera, and could read from it, but got an error when trying to take a picture.

I've had one of these for about two years. I bought it because it had the dual purpose of card reader and flash drive. The build quality is cheap at best but if you're careful it seems to be fine. One nice feature is that both Windows XP and Mac (Snow Leopard) have read it without problem.,neutral
It is the best of the FM transmitters I've tried but it still comes up short when used in my car with a fairly good audio system. You can't turn volume up without static coming up (Tried every Freq). But on a plain old radio at normal volume you'd probably won't notice anything wrong.,neutral

Bought this camera for my daughter.  My sister had a Casio but the 5 mp and the 10mp is truly a better quality picture. My daughter carrys it with you at all times.

"This is nicely laid out, with the pockets plentiful and easy to access.  I like that the hardware is metal and not cheap plastic, which tends to snap under pressure.

The shade seems adequate for the Nikon kit lenses I purchased with my D40 (18-55mm and 55-200mm).

This is a nice hand strap and base for someone using the iPad in an environment where they stand and hold the tablet and then need a place to rest the tablet often.  Off hand I think education and retail are two good starting places.  For me the way this case connects to the tablet makes it NOT usable.

I wanted to like this case but in the end I returned it.Pros:-Thinner case compared to others-Magnetic cover-Cutouts allow full functionality-Feels durable-Prevents scratchesMine had an issue where closing the cover would not turn on/off the screen without adjusting the cover when opening/closing.

"Bought in hopes of improving Dell Inspiron case cooling.  Worked OK, but not as good as the original Dell fan (go figure!).  Clever wiring design allowed me to connect both fans to single connection.  Moved this fan to the front intake area and kept original Dell fan in place.  Overall reduced case temps ~ 5 degrees once I got it into a configuration that worked for me so it was worth keeping.",neutral
"It's cheaply made, the button fell out of the device soon after buying, and I still haven't used the remote control... but it still works.

It does not attach well to the arm and cannot stay attached well if placed upside down. There are others like this available through Staples that work much better.,neutral
"I gave a three star because I bought two pair and the other pair works fine but this one didn't last. They came with several bud caps, fit nicely in the ear and produced good sound.

These cables are very cheap but also very cheaply made.  I use them to hook my smartphone to my car stereo and they work fine for that.

They sound ok. Good bass but distorted on some tracks. My biggest complaint is that they are unusable on the go.

This rf modulator works converts composite sources to rf cable output. As to autoswitching this only applies to the choice between antenna in and ONE video source. You can only attach a maximum of 2 sources. I routed one source to ant. In (game output) and the other source to the composite inputs (DVD) . At first I expected the unit to allow switching between MULTIPLE composite sources. Not so.,neutral
Its pretty cheap which was expected but seems to work just fine just seems like they can break easily but nothing has broken yet,neutral
"The cable itself is good quality and easy to work with. I pulled about 2 feet out of the box before it jammed. I opened the box up removed tangle and got another 2 feet out before it tangled. Upon further inspection, the whole length of the cable was hopelessly tangled. I've used about 300ft of it and I had to take it out of the box so I could use it at all.",neutral
"Was a decent camera. For the price, I recommend and Canon, Sony, or a Nikon. Casio Z1000 was very fast but the color was a bit distorted. My Z100 lasted one deployment in Iraq, and that was it. Not recommend it.",neutral
"It does the job but is of low quality. I don't regret this purchase, and for the price you can't go wrong.",neutral
"It is as advertised, designed a la Apple, which is the main reason I picked it over other ones, but it has a slight flaw, it is not heavy enough to stay flat on the desk... the weight of the cables makes it tip to the front, BUT do not be discouraged from buying it.. it is still nice and serves its purpose. I am definitely ordering another one, I just wish manufacturers pay attention these days to details.",neutral
The only problem so far that I can see with this product is the transfer rate from the camera to my computer is way too slow.....I hate to sit and wait for things. The Plus side is it can upload your photos automatically to your computer to a folder It even does videos.... I like that as I do allot of videos.,neutral
"I was very proud of this cable at first and was recommending it to everyone.  I received it in January and have already had to replace it though, so it went from a 5 to a 3.  Disappointed.",neutral
Fast but couple of concerns:1. the cable is too short and stiff.2. the CF socket is too shallow and not much 'guide' for the CF card. Needs to be extra cautious to insert the card or you'll damage the CF socket.,neutral

"This mono speaker puts out good sound for how small and cheep it is.  I love the rechargeable battery and multiple inputs.

Hardware is cheap and the entire unit is cumbersome. No room on smaller bikes and I have a wide glide.,neutral
I have used previous products. Four of them all surived less than the announced hours - 60 hours. In average I will say about 30 hours of life time. There is no much choice from Amazon. You have to buy more in case they stop working any time. Wish my new ones will last at least 50 hours. I am searching for sprial flurorescent set to save bucks.,neutral

"Worked for a couple of months, but was cheap and that was expected. The cable was made of a thick material and felt sturdy but that did not stop the connect coming loose and eventually the cord would mess up if jiggled enough.

"Out-of-the-box, this unit only gave my 75% capacity. (~4200 mAh instead of ~5600) But it's held that pretty well for almost a year. For the price, it's hard to beat that.",neutral

"It's fun to play with but unless you are really into photographic, probably you will not use these products that much.The remote died right out of box otherwise I'll give it a 4 star.I used on my T4i and tested with all the filters included. Filters are alright, not great, but OK to see the difference.",neutral
"Budget board, with budget specs.  Its hard to find, but this board only runs it s PCI-E x16 (the graphics slot) at 1.0 speed.  This kills performance of newer graphics cards.  I really wish this were more documented both on Amazon, and on Asus's site.",neutral
"it works well, crisp images on my monitor, no flickering, no interference. It is just that the cable looks thin but at the same time not flexible enough that I am afraid that, if I fold it too strong in a U-shape instead of natural spirals without cable tension, then it may break.But it works well and got it quickly and at a very competitive price, so no worries so far!",neutral
"I thought this screen protector was going to be more sturdy, but it was a bit flimsy and I could not for the life of me get out all the bubbles.  It looks like a stiff thicker screen protector that would be easy to install and not easily bubble, but that is not the case.  Someone with more patience than I could probably like it better.",neutral
"The card works great in the camera, but I have to use a USB cable to get the pictures into the laptop.  The card is not recognized in my laptop which is more annoying than anything.  Other cards work in my laptop, which are not SanDisk.  Formatting the card per instructions make no difference.",neutral
Works great and fully equipped while quality lasts. I loved it but the screen ended up going blue. Eventually found that it was an internal defect from manufacturer but was only out $15 so no big deal just get a different one^^,neutral
"I was looking for some computer speakers to use temporarily and I took a chance on these.  I wouldn't rate them as highly as the other reviewers.

"This sleeve is okay.  I prefer the Nixon (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C10T2EC/) because it has the same slim form-factor plus a zipped pocket, which is good for holding the stylus and Bluetooth Wireless Adapter for the Type Cover (for example).",neutral

"Bought it for the price which was a bad idea.  It has a plastic lens mount, which I hate!  The quality of the photo's is pretty good.  I don't use it often in my wedding photography but it serves it's purpose for letting me zoom in close when I need to.",neutral

"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my dad. He had an old ball mouse. So far it works fine. Mine at home is starting to act up, so if it continues to work, I will be purchasing another one of these.",neutral
Easy to use as long as you don't mind dealing with I-tunes to store your music.  Probably best suited for people with small fingers.  My wife is happy with it and that's all that counts!,neutral
"The unit itself works well, however connection issues are consistent when using mobile devices. Poor or non-existent support for mobile devices. Complicated setup as well.",neutral
The sticky part on it doesn't hold well... usually lets go after about 5 minutes. The sound quality really depends on what you connect it to. Overall I can't say I would buy one of these again unless there were some major improvements.,neutral

"Honestly I have purchased different cords from different places most were okay one or two stopped working for me so I cannot rate this one in particular because I don't know which one it is.  If it is an Apple cord it was probably fine. Some of the third party cords give a message on the phone that it may not work, but usually does anyway.",neutral
It did 95% of the work but I would expect a tool like this to do the job 100% and not leave me having to clean up the edges before I can use the card.The two adapters that come with the card were of no use putting the SIM back into a Nokia handset. I wound up using the remnant of the original SIM to put the card back into a full size SIM slot.,neutral

The Batttery is probably OK. The Description leaves something to be desired. Can'y say more because I did not use the battery.,neutral
Feels very cheap. The USB connector sounded great but it will not lock in place to insert.

It's fairly low quality and the plastic is a little flimsy but you get what you pay for.

Good sound from a very small package. Nice to be able to fill up a memory card full of songs that will go for weeks. The bad - battery was dead out of the box. Would not charge at all. Cell all the way dead. I had to use an old battery out of my very old Nokia cell phone. Worked fine with that. The controls are hard to get used to. Manual just barely helps at all.,neutral
I mistakenly bought a camera that uses a micro SD card.  Big mistake.  No computer will take the card.  This card adapts the micro card for use in a computer that takers standard SD cards. Three stars as it's overpriced for what you get. A piece of plactic with a few copper stripes.,neutral

"I bought like 5 different versions of this same rca adapter between ordering and receiving this one. Looking at it I think I would have been just as good off taking a knife to an old pair and buying and end piece to just twist on and forget, it looks like that's what they did here. Low quality, but it didn't cost hardly anything at all s why not try it. Maybe you'll get lucky.",neutral
It is good because protects but the buttons dont stay at the right place so it is bad to use manual mode and to take movies.,neutral

I bought hot pink ones and thought the sound would be small like other mp3 speakers that have disapointed me in the past :-( but was pleasantly surprised..............buying a pair for my neice to put in her room.For the price definately worth it.,neutral
I've owned many pair of Skullcandy earbuds. You get what you pay for and these are cheap. One side dies within a year and it simply isn't worth trying to make use of the warranty.,neutral
"Bought this to improve the sound from a 24"" Samsung LCD TV. Does that, but it really is for desktop use since it lacks a remote. I knew that when I bought it. Sound is better, not tinny like the puny Sammy speakers. There may be better options out there--this works, but cheaper computer speakers will probably do the trick as well.",neutral
"I thought having this zoom was a great addition to my T2i.  But truth is I swear my 50mm prime I got for less than $100 takes sharper photos than this one.

"I ordered this for my iTouch 4G but is really for the iPhone 4G. It works well as a mirror, but as a mirror I can still see my reflection when I run my apps.

Since I carry my iTouch everywhere, it is great as a mirror but don't expect much more.",neutral
"The iPad2 just fits but the zipper will scratch the corner edges unless you pull the zipper away from the unit when closing.  The should have made the case about 1/4"" larger.

"Tried it out this week, does not seem to hold it's charge as long as the Canon battery(looks better though!).I use it as back up.",neutral
Original extended battery that came with my 1501 lasted longer per charge.  Not a complaint as the battery from the manufacturer of the laptop costs twice as much.Not even a year later and the battery is needing to be replaced.  The stock Dell battery at least held a longer charge and lasted almost 2 years.,neutral
"I don't really care for how cheap the case looks.  I bought it as an add on to the larger case, but it doesn't look very sturdy.  I'm going to keep it because I won't be handling it but so much and don't want to pay the shipping cost to return it.",neutral
"I've only used it a couple of times and it has been functioning as advertised. My only issue with this tripod is that it feels cheap and somewhat unsturdy.

"The design of this is great in theory, however it seems the fan is lacking in power, even with the speed control all the way up. Overall, its not too bad, based on the selection in this price range, but it is no where near as good as an old swiss army one I bought about 5 years ago for the same price.",neutral

Not sure how to review this one but it is 50 ft of Ethernet cable that I was going to use to run a small video player box that hooks to the TV. I thought I would just plug it in whenever I was going to stream video to the TV well I got tired of winding it up and then trying to string it out to use and just ended up buying wireless for the house instead.,neutral
"I'm very happy with the sound quality of these earbuds.  I typically use Skull Candy earbuds, but thought I'd give these a try.  My only complaint is that the part that remains outside of the ear is big and heavy and the earbud tends to fall out easily if I am moving around.",neutral
"If you're buyting this product just to listen to music out loud, then don't get it. You can use any speakers for that. Also I have the HTC one s and was confused on how to hook it up bc the micro usb is on the side not bottom. I just returned it cuz I was too lazy to figure it out.",neutral

cuts out sound be careful buying this cheap cable. I would not recommend this cable. You have to spend time twisting and bending the cable to get sound.,neutral
The background stand and muslins are quite nice for the price. The umbrellas are very weak and not useful for photography at all.

"this product works okay, but if you use the security features it significantly reduces both range and speed. One good thing is that you really don't need the security features since you are just using it as a range extender and it is not part of your 'secure' network.

The battery is working good but the cable is broken when I connect the cable to my cellphone isn't charger but when I change the cable is working good.,neutral
"At first this device worked perfectly but over about 6 months of infrequent use the connection started getting spotty.  it would produced a fuzzy radio sound then, when I tried it again moments or hours later the connection would either work or not.  If it worked with the stereo all the time this would be a great product but since it doesn't the most I can give is three stars.",neutral
"I've had two of these screens. Both of them were okay, but I've had two gripes:1) The retraction instructions are a bit unclear. The label on the handle makes it sound like you have to pull the screen all the way down, but in fact it's a fast, sharp pull that causes it to go into retract mode. It's annoying.2) Both screens I received had ripples that caused the image to distort somewhat.",neutral
"There is also a larger version of this friction mount, and both don't work on my Subaru Forester dash. I havn't found any dash mount that works on my car. This is the 4th type I've purchased.",neutral
Got this thing set up and after a week or so it went into protection mode.  Had to cart it back and forth to local service center where they repaired it under warranty (but had it for a long time.)After the repair it works fine.

"Well built and sounds fine for the money. Easy to use and portable. I mainly bought this to use during tailgating at football games. It works good except for the ipod adapters which is a shame. I'd hate to have the connector get messed up on my ipod just trying to seat my ipod into this device. So, i will just connect my ipod to the aux input and not worry about it.",neutral
"Design is good, but it's signal week, so, sometimes, it's hard to listen my mp3 player through my car audio.",neutral
It is a decent product for the price.  I ordered from two different companies. This one has choppy video and okay sound quality.,neutral
This is great in concept. Directions leave a little to be desired and it is VERY difficult to connect the main connector to the power supply. I have not used it a lot yet and that is why I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt with 3 stars. Preliminary tests indicate it may not be working.,neutral

Bought this little unit with the WDLive Plus as part of a deal.  Unit did work but just wasn't fast enough to maintain or sometimes even connect to network services.150 mbs probably too slow.

Packaging for the Fintie Case was adequate.  I was very disappointed with the case itself in that the openings for the 'on' button and the 'charger' were covered by the leather.  I had to cut the areas larger in order for the functions to operate as they were suppose to.  I will not order another Fintie product.,neutral
"This cover is clearly made for the Fire. It is simple and intuitive.  It fits well and performs as advertised but is pricey for what it is.

"It works. But the cable is short, about 8.5"" from end to end. It's not the high quality piece you are looking for.",neutral
"Strange keyboard configuration. Hot keys not what I expected. Needs numerous key strokes to access things, like eject. Hard to see the black keys in the dark. I'm sending it back.",neutral

There is not enough slack in the hinge on this case for the cover to fold back flat.  Compounding this problem is the fact that it has no elastic strap to hold the case opened.  This case does the job, but it's not that great.  I've already ordered another one.",neutral
"Modem was listed as very good condition. It does work ok, but looked like it had been dragged down the road. Not worth returning, but the person that graded this item sure wouldn't be happy if they had bought it. Luckily it will be located out of sight. I would have graded it as well worn but working. I am giving three stars only because it works as it should, but should be one star for it's condition.",neutral
"I recieved the product two days ago (waited a long time due to international shipping) and almost forgot I ordered these.

"While these are so cheap the ""I can use four of these for one original"" argument stands, do you want to change your battery 5 times in one wedding? Because that's what I had to do with these. The charger works and having them for emergency backup is not a bad idea, but I'd rather invest in something that's not going to have me missing the cake cutting because the battery randomly dies.",neutral
"I don't understand why people gave this 5 stars, maybe they had the thing plugged in right where they wanted to use it. If not It won't work good, i have to plug it into a usb extender and put it right near the mouse for it to work good.  But at least it works good when it's like that.",neutral
"It is very slow. I know, I should have looked for a higher class, but other same class cards in the same devises work faster. I ended up using this one for just data storage, which is always very helpful, so I am fine. But if you are planning to buy it for camera or so, look for 6+ class.",neutral

Very small. That is it's own advantage and own disadvantage.  DO NOT USE under a netbook larger than 10&#34; IMHO.,neutral
"Took some getting use to, because I'm accustomed to a brighter, more detailed sound. But the warmth and creaminess makes for a pleasant listening experience. Older analog recordings sound better with these cans as it masks the imperfections and smoothens everything out. Not really good for the studio where definition and detail are paramount. Good upgrade for those coming out of cheap headsets.",neutral

Bought this for a kitchen tv to be able to play netflix while cooking or eating in there.  Easily hidden away in the back of the tv and you can't beat the price. If you have a smartphone or tablet this is a no brainer.,neutral
Unfortunately this stylus does not work with any Apple products so I was unable to really get a good use out of it. I gave it 3 stars because I didn't want to screw up their rating simply because I wasn't compatible with my device.,neutral

"This is an OK remote.  We use it with my wife's Rebel XTI. It gets the job done eventually.  It doesn't always take the shot when you want it to, so you'll end up with some interesting photos.  It's better than setting the timer, and running to you spot though.",neutral
I took this thing to Tokyo.  It was basically a waste of space.  I'm not sure if it was the voltage in Tokyo or if I just got a busted piece of equipment.

Unfortunately from time to time you come by an inexpensive product that holds up to the saying &#34;You get what you pay for&#34; and this my friends is that product.

"Great product, works as expected but creates lots of shadows on the screen that are not there when plugged in directly so they are artifacts from the switch box.",neutral

I just can't seem to get anything more than about 4-5 feet away. 6 feet would be acceptable, but I really hit the 5 foot mark and the remote just wont communicate with the camera.

I owned one of these for compact flash worked great.Bought this one for my new digital camera and found out that it doesn't support anything above 512mb.

Have had this speaker for about 7 years and it still works. It's very easy to install. It is louder than my cb speaker but the speaker quality could be better.,neutral
Definitely not one of Samsung's market leading products but it works ok. Keys are tacky to the touch. But you get what you pay for so cannot complain.,neutral

This Auxiliary cord works but it is difficult to use. The cord often gets caught and I have trouble untangling it. While I'm driving the last thing I want to be doing is messing with a cord. I ended up purchasing a different Aux cord (from Griffin) to replace this one. It will work in a pinch but the cord problem was too annoying for me. The sound is okay though.,neutral
I really liked the idea of running windows on a tablet. I was not ready to give google doc's a chance.  It is fast and does a lot of things well. It was just too small for me.  Using exel I could hardly read the numbers and trying to click on a cell was a pain. I upgraded to a IPad and am much happier. This may not be a bad product just did not meet my needs.,neutral
"This is great for connecting some standard tablets, cameras, and even some phones to a larger computer screen or television. If you have need for something like this, check it out and make sure that this product is exactly what you are looking for. If it is, it is both a great value and a useful tool.",neutral
"This is about what I expected, but a little bit on the cheap side. It looks a little more like plastic than I hoped it would. It is functional and fits the iPad Mini perfectly.",neutral
"It's trivial to hook up (it can only go in one way so there's no way to hook it up incorrectly), but the image that showed up on the TV was VERY grainy/pixelated. I don't know if it's this device, or the repeater/extension HDMI cable. Research carefully before buying",neutral
"nice cover,  I like the flip thing makes it look like a notebook, only issue is the grooves, they should be sealed or something the grooves are put in to allow you to set the stand up thing,  but they also let dust in,  so you get 2 lines of dust down your screen.",neutral
An OK camera but too small for my big hands.  Seems the picture quality was inconsistent. Some were great but many came out on the blurry side.  Probably operator error! I returned it.,neutral
"I installed this to increase recording capacity of my cable box, which was too low.  I can't tell when it takes over from my cable box, as just a % is given.

I used these for at least 3-4 hours every day and they fit my ears really well.  I used them to workout at the gym and while running outside and didn't have trouble keeping them in.  Just disappointed that they broke down after 6 months.,neutral
"Good - The product fits a specific need and fits that need wellThe bad - The quality is.... not strong sturdy nor worth writing home aboutThe Ugly - The instructions were tiny pictures illegible, and only came in chinese.If it was higher quality I would had given it 5 stars for the value, but as is and due to the stress of installing, 3 starts for meeting the need at a great price.",neutral
As long as this product does what it is supposed to then I have no problem with it. I tried to do it but I was in a hurry so I have not done it yet. I thought it would be really fast but it wasn't so I will try again to set it up.,neutral
The battery compartment clip broke the very first time I tried to open it to connect the battery. It feels solid and works as advertised but the thickness of the tap for the battery compartment was way too thin and it just snapped when I put pressure on it to open the compartment.  I'll have to use it for some time before I can give it a better rating.,neutral
This is an OEM naked drive. which means that it has no software in the box and it also doesn't have the SATA cables or the mounting screws. the product description isnt clear about that. Many of the other reviews stated as such. pretty good price though.,neutral
"This unit has great sound for such a low price, and it comes with a remote, but all the remote does is turn up and down the sound. It won't do anything else. Maybe I did not read the information well enough or it was not stated, but I thought it would have been able to change songs with the remote.",neutral
"In my first review I noted that this unit would not play blu-ray disksbut played dvd nicely by simply connecting a USB.  I added 5V 1.9 amps to the unit, and it now plays blu ray nicely.  In short it appears underpowed for blu ray through usb only.",neutral
Gets so hot after the nights backup - you can hardly touch it - and then it died....I like the drive but....,neutral
"Not bad.  The power seems to come and go sometimes which causes my iPhone to make that noise it makes when you plug it into power constantly.  It was cheap, though so whatevs.",neutral
"Cameras have now become WiFi so having to work with wired cameras even through outlets is kind of a step back. The features of the unit are also limited unless you get a paid subscription. I loaned this unit to my boss since he likes this kind of stuff, but he was unable to get the software to load. It wanted to disable all his firewalls and this freaked him out so he passed.",neutral
"This flash drive was incredibly cheap compared to others when I bought it. That is the only reason I purchased it, to be honest.Using it is easy, but don't expect to transfer GBs of files in less than a couple of hours.",neutral
I plugged the drive in and my Win 7 PC indicated it was downloaded a driver.  After that I could read and writes files just fine.  It does have an annoying habit of refusing to eject disks with labels on them.  I've had to simultaneously hold the eject button and extract the disk with tweezers.,neutral
I wanted some extra chargers for some phones/other devices.  This has turned out to be a good generic replacement for the &#34;name-brand&#34; ones.,neutral

"I ordered a pair; put them thru very wet and hard conditions, battery lasts a lot, it has a very strong mile range, only problem is that one of the radios mic failed after a couple of day hiking, good thing I brought the other one as an emergency. I think all the sweat and rain damaged it.",neutral
"The reason I gave this 3 and not 5 stars is the surface is slippery.  It isn't as easy to hold onto as some of the others that are sold.  Other than that, it's fine.",neutral
"The switch for S-Video and Composite is labeled backward.  The converter converts analog signal (yellow, red, white) to a digital HDMI signal but does not convert to HD quality.",neutral
"I know these are fluorescent lights, so with that in mind, you have to adjust your white balance to avoid the greenish hue in your images. For the price though, you can't go wrong. I bought these for my two soft boxes, and they fit just fine. No problems.",neutral
"The sound pick up seems to be alright, but the little light that lets you know it is only only blinks once when you turn it on, so it is very easy to leave it on and not know it.

I was disapointed that I couldn't get my ipod touch to charge off of the included USB port using my standard ipod cable.",neutral
"Not very loud, bass is lacking badly!  I ended up buying a powered sub and hooked it up and now the bass is perfect.  I was a little shocked that a 1000w system had such limited volume.

"It isn't as fast as the class10 I used before, and the file structure only allows 29.7G free to put data on.  I can see SOME loss, but I'm very displeased with losing over 2G of space!  That's a big waste percentage.",neutral
"Works okay, but does not seem to hold a charge as well as the original battery that came with the camera.  Not sure why, but the price was fair and I will continue to try and use it.",neutral
"I love the design, but the cord is SUPER short. I originally ordered these because of their style and I'd be okay with them being on top of the desk for the plugs, but the cord won't reach to the outlet.",neutral
"I bought a dozen of these for a project.  The keystone Snap-in worked just fine and stayed secure.  It is very simple product, but I had one problem with one of the jacks.  I inserted a USB cable into the jack with a little bit of force (very little) and the black part pushed right through the white part (broken).  Careful not to use too much force when inserting USB cable I guess.",neutral
"These worked well initially, but were worse quality than the ultra-cheap adapters we bought from China. Ultimately they started falling apart after a year of use. Not worth replacing, we started using DP-HDMI and DP-DVI cables instead of adapters.",neutral
"Bought this to match the router. Worked great, but upgraded to a newer Linksys model router later on for larger 2 floor houses.",neutral
"The Tecsun PL398BT functions almost flawlessly, and feels well built.  My only big disappointment is that the sound is overly thin from the speakers.

Battery life seems exceptionally good.",neutral
Nothing special but useful when needed.  It has worked when I needed it.  Keeping track of where I put the cable is more of a problem.  If only someone would make an easy to use and organize cable storage box or case.,neutral

"I was doing some customizing on the case for my Nexus 7. Worked great for the mods I needed to do. As for their original purpose, I only used the various sized USB and 3.5mm and they seemed to fit but did not have a lot of confidence that they would not fall out with normal everyday use.",neutral
Very inexpensive. Huge amounts of noise but that's to be expected with such a tiny wire and and no amplification to the signal. Probably need inline amp with wire this long and this small.,neutral

These sound good in the highs and low's. Some sounds are way to dim to enjoy and you cant use any male to male 3.5mm cord because when i did i got cracking sound maybe a bad pair? idk. wouldn't buy again thoUpdate. The bass nob can get glitchy and they are bright i prefer Koss portapros to these and those are cheaper then the Steez.,neutral
"These are poor build quality, one came with unstitched zipper and the play sand I used to fill them works through the fabric.  I would suggest putting the sand inside of a large plastic bag first.  You get what you pay for, they will work with a little stitching but nothing to rave about.",neutral
"Losing my ear buds became a problem during exercise sessions.  When I saw these phones at the Amazon site, I thought they might be a solution to my annoying pop-out issue.

You don't need a voltage converter for an iPhone/iPod/iPad. Their chargers are dual voltage (I.e. 100-240V-50/60Hz). You only need a plug converter for less than $2. Look at your power supply or plug before you buy unnecessary (and expensive) transformers,neutral

This is very durable and has a nice look and feel. However the ipod slides out the case when it is held upsided down. I have to put an on a rubber case so that it does not slide out and break. Its worth the price.,neutral

Used it for a couple of months now with no major issues until last month.  The device would not power on coming out of sleep.  Now it seems to disconnect even when the computer is in use.  Had to replug it in every time for it to work.  Suspecting it has a loose USB connection.,neutral

I purchased the front and rear covers. I installed both but ended up removing the screen cover because it made the screen look horrible. My iPad 2 screen is so clear that covering it with a dirty looking plastic sheet just made no sense. So i would only recommend the rear cover and the Apple cover.

The case is nice and sturdy but if you re looking for a case to hold everything you need such as an extra battery or lens-forget abot it.  It is ONLY to hold the camera and nothing else.

"This touchpad is a must for anybody that struggles with the confines of their current laptop. Windows 8 gestures really bring the new OS to life.

Good idea. Can buy locally.,neutral
"Works pretty good, but it isn't easy to learn and even then kind of difficlult/clumsy to use. The buttons are so small and so close together, it's hard to type and the airmouse is too sensitive.

"I installed this to monitor my garage doors and it is just a bit finicky. Sometimes when it closes it gives an alert that it is closed, then open, then closed all in a span of about 1 second.

Oh, the range isn't great compared to my hard-wired z-wave equipment -- but that's part of the price you pay with battery operated wireless products.",neutral
"I was really happy with this for 14 months.  Suddenly it stopped working for the mouse,  keyboard and sound on the second computer while still working on the first.

"The packaging is literally a ziploc bag with a paper inset and some extra rubber part replacements. This lack of packaging may be how they keep the prices down.

This adapter worked somewhat well and for the price still isn't a bad deal.  If you use tape adapters as much as I have you know they all crap out eventually with heavy every day use.  This one lasted 8 months before it stopped working so I guess I cant complain.,neutral
"This didn't &#34;blow me away,&#34; but it's a nice addition to a computer case with a window in it. The problem with these kind of lights is, the actual &#34;cathode&#34; tube is white, and just the outer casing is green, which means the output looks more white than green...this would be true of any color. It's the same light used in scanners.Overall, for the price, it looks pretty nice, and very easy to install with a basic molex connector.",neutral

When it works it's great.  The problem is it has a mind of it's own and just quits from time to time.  It does not shuffle well and is want to play the same tunes over and over and over - you get the idea.  A lot of money for a product with a bunch of electronic glitches.,neutral

I have no pity for American corporations who cut their own throats this way. They sure's heck have none for me.,neutral

I don't imagine it would survive being stepped on, and its size makes it particularly easy to misplace.

"This update of our old Garmin has lifetime updates for US and Canada.  It's handsome and has a few very good improvements over the older model.It suffers from the same problems as the old Garmin.

"I found this remote unreasonably difficult to program for some of my components, particularly my Yamaha receiver.  The receiver is a relatively new model, and should not have been that difficult.  I could have made it work, eventually, but I ended up not using it and using the RCA RCRPS06GR 6-Device Remote with Presets instead.  It is a much better remote in my opinion.",neutral

Low Price decent picture.",neutral
"I bought this for my parents, as my mother was ill and she wanted a two-way system rather than the one-way baby monitor.  It is fine for it's intended purpose, but a little complicated for older persons (and a little for us in our 40's).  It is also very light weight, so it is easily knocked off.  You have to use batteries, or find a DC adapter.  Fortunately we had a couple laying around.",neutral

Generally pleased with this flash drive if it has any drawbacks I would say It could have a faster write time. I store large video files and the write time on the drive a little faster than writing to a DVD disc. If you are in no hurry this is a good product. I have read of some drives failing but not so far for me.,neutral
"These are perfect for my needs. They are a bit flimsy so don't expect them to hold up to alot of use. However, my intended use is only occassional.

"I've owned these cables for a few months now and while the cables themselves are extremely sturdy and resilient, the latches on the micro-usb connectors have stopped holding themselves into my devices on both of the cables I own.

Otherwise though, they perform well and are of great quality!",neutral
"I wanted to use this to split MacBook Pro's DVI-I to 1x DVI-D and 1x VGA. DVI-D would go to KVM switch, VGA would go directly to a monitor.

At least the DVI-D portion of it works as advertised, so I'm partly happy.",neutral

"The magnetic filter attachment is a good idea and overcomes Sony's failure to provide for attaching filters to its exceptional camera.

"For the price, I expected a much better sound. For example, the Sony HTCT260 sound bar is cheaper but has a much better sound and is much easier in assembly. For this bar, I did like how it looks but assembly was more difficult that it should have been (awful design for the stands). Also, material on the speakers looks very light and fragile and so you get the feeling that it just cannot support deeper sound.",neutral
"I bought these for a person who could not get used to their C-PAP machine's noise (yep, C-PAP is generally quiet) and would prefer to go to sleep to the sound of an audiobook.What happened with this headset has happened with multiple headsets designed for sleep use: the cable was severed by a single cat bite.Ok folks, come up with an armored, cat-proof, cable. That's an option worth the price.",neutral
it was new but didn't come with many ear piece option so it don't fix over the ear very good.

I can only assume that the manufacturer of the Universal Master control RF20 is no longer in business because I have tried to contact them by email and phone for several months and received no reply to resolve a small problem.

But if you are thinking of using this indoors, you will probably be disappointed.",neutral

The touch screen is not responsive as iPad or Samsung. The universal remote I had to program every single day as device kept forgetting all programmed remotes.,neutral
"I got this off amazon and although I got it at a great price, it became more of a burden to use. Maybe it's just me, but I like to see the entire month ahead of me.

Ended up selling it on eBay.",neutral
"The plastic is too thick over the selection wheel and half the time I would have to press to spin it over and over to change songs.  Not a great solution, but I cut out the plastic over the wheel and that worked out OK. I like the color.  It was tight but fairly easy to get on.",neutral

You can't even fast forward through them.  For this reason, I would look for a different player.",neutral

I picked this up for about $3.00  for a quick download of pictures to my PC it can't be beat.
