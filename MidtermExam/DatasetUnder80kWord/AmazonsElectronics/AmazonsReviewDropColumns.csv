I am using this with a Nook HD+. It works as described. The HD picture on my Samsung 52&#34; TV is excellent.,positive
The cable is very wobbly and sometimes disconnects itself.The price is completely unfair and only works with the Nook HD and HD+,negative
"This item is just as was described in the original description, works without any issues to be seen. Good product",positive
bought for a spare for my 9&#34; Nook HD and it fit perfectly.  Very satisfied with the price much less than on the BN site,positive
"My son crewed my HD charger cord so I needed another one, this is exactly like the one my son destroyed.",positive
"This is a good beefy 2 amp charger, but it covers two outlets on a power strip. It's ok in a regular wall outlet. The best thing is it uses a standard USB connector so it can charge more than just a Nook (I have a Kindle Fire HD+).",neutral
"I lost my B&N original cable.  I looked around for an new one.  I tried  a different, cheaper model but it didn't fit my device properly so back to the drawing board.  I ordered this one.  I am satisfied.  It works exactly as expected and fits perfectly.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a spare or in lieu of the original usb cable adapter.",positive
"Go to Target or Barnes and Noble instead, and pay $25 (which is still a huge markup, considering they make the thing for 50 cents.) This is the worst option if you need one of these. It's price gouging, pure and simple.",neutral
"Works well, a little pricey I think for a charging cable, but then again, not losing the original would be a lot cheaper than any replacement",positive
"This is a great buy, compared to a $60 or more a retail store.",positive
This mount is just what I needed.  It is strong and sturdy.  It folds almost flat to enable the television to sit square and flat against the wall if desired and extends and rotates for angle turns.  A perfect fit as long as you match the correct visa pattern for your television.,positive
"Great deal, easy to mount and it appears to be fairly sturdy. I mounted a 32 in tv on it and it works great.",positive
This mount works really well once you get it up and going.  Only problem is just the arms are a little goofy getting them all in the right spot.  But that's really not too big an issue considering all the different TV's and their mounting hole locations.,positive
for the price you just cant beat this item. I bought it for a house I was selling so I could hang some tv and it worked great. Good quality for the price.,positive
"Took a bit of work, but used this to fit an older vizio 32&#34; monitor to the wall to use as a compute monitor. Stable and like the ability to move the tv to different angles. The vizio was older and did not have the standard holes, this product fit and holds the tv very stable.",positive
I used this for my 47&#34; Samsung. Its fit/feel is great. Easy installation. Appears strong; although I personally spent way too much on the tv to risk leaving it fully outstretched with too little lag bolts for a long time! It is very convenient to be able to move it away from the wall however and I would feel very comfortable tilt or swiveling if needed. The movement is fluid and easily adjustable.I am very pleased with my purchase.,positive
"This item serves its purpose as well as any other mount.  Its most appealing attribute is its large range of motion.  I am using this to corner-mount a 32"" TV and it works perfectly to hide the mount, receptacles, and cables behind the TV.  Very easy installation as well.",positive
I love this mount.  This is the 4th one I've bought and it works great every time.  excellent seller and excellent product,positive
I am very glad for buying it.  It is heavy duty and good quality for the price.  It was very easy to install.,positive
this holds up my 55inch sony with ease. make sure u mount this with ur own lag screws into the heart of the 2x4 ur mounting to and u won't have any problem--u may have to make a modificatoin or two but use ur brain and figure it out-- it'll be there till the house falls!!!3inch lag screws is the way to go don't be cheap go buy em.---how much did u pay for the tv????,positive
Nice quality still works great... very happy with this purchase... need to add 10 more words.. so what can I say its a wall mount that I haven't had any problems with,positive
"Great bracket for small TVs.  I used it on a 19"" LCD and it worked well.  The large mounting plate may block some connections on some TVs.  Installed easily and could be adjusted to make level.  The links were very tight and need to be loosened for initial installation.  When the TV is in the desired position, you can tighten them up.",positive
"I bought this for a 22"" TV for my son. I mounted this onto the corner stud and it works great! I love the angles it can achieve. Fees Very sturdy and well built. It works perfect for my application. Very happy with this purchase!",positive
"Didn't think it would work as well as it has,because the metal was a lighter guage thanwe expected, but it hardly deflected from theweight of the TV, even extended straight out.",positive
"very heavy duty construction, extends, tilts perfectlya steal at this pricewill be happy to buy another 1 or 2 if needed",positive
Well constructed wall mount for TV sets up to 37 inches. The mounting  plate has numerous holes for varius sets. Plenty of extra hardware provided. Price was about 1/8th of what it would cost on the open market. I recommend it highly.,positive
"This mount is excellent. It is very well built and sturdy. I used it to mount a 32"" TV and it fit the need perfectly. The price was also very good and much, much cheaper than what an inferior mount would cost in a retail store. I would definitely recommend.",positive
Works great and is so much cheaper than the more expensive versions at the Big box stores. It is super easy to install yourself too. You just need a drill and a ratchet set to get it into the stud (oh yea a stud finder too).,positive
"We bought this for the tv in our gym as it gets moved around a bit.  It's definitely sturdy and works well.  Our tv in there is 24&#34;,",positive
This mount is easy to install and very sturdy and is very functional and very affordable for the price. A+,positive
"Works like a charm! Lies flat on the wall when I want it too and pulls out and swivels like a charm when I need it too!The instructions call for it to be mounted into a stud in the wall, however mine is mounted directly into the drywall using heavy duty anchors and it works perfect as well! This is a great product for an amazing price!",positive
"Easey to put together and install. Used to mount a 37"" LED flat screen. Instuction say to mount the complete unit but if you mount the TV to the back plate on the ground first its a one person job. Well built product for being made in China.wish you could buy American made, better luck next time.",positive
I hung this in my house with great ease and it held up my 8 year old son because I wasn't going to put the 55&#34; flat screen on it to find out that it failed. Fully extends out 2 feet. This was worth the money.,positive
"Wanted the monitor off of the desk, so we mounted on the wall.  I would have rather had a vertical adjustment as well, but for the price, this unit does the job.",neutral
"very secure, we did have to use concrete bolts thought since we were putting it on an outside wall made of lath and plaster with concrete brick on the outside.  One of the best features is there is one piece that attaches to the tv and another that attaches to the wall.  the piece on the tv actually hooks onto the piece on the wall.  I am really happy with this purchase.",positive
Holds the TV fine and the articulation is great.  We use it in a downstairs bedroom where we can move it to be seen from the bed or the treadmill.  Has cable mgmt as well.,positive
Another great buy from Amazon. The local stores wanted twice the money and the other mounts were cheaply made. this mount is made well and you get a free hdmi cable and level with it,positive
Just to know that the TV will sit off center of where the base is placed. Other than that it has held up and worked.,positive
"Quality was excellent. Instructions were clear. It was not clear about a tilt feature, but there was enough to level it when I finished. Be careful to get the wall bracket real vertical. (I was using it for a 23 inch computer screen so I really need it to be level for reading.) Everything I needed plus lots of extra hardware for different situations.",positive
"For the price, this wall mount is great.  Not too hard to install.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is wire management.  I could not get the little loop to work.  Not a big deal at all however.  Overall, I highly recommend this product.  Well worth the money.",positive
"Needed a corner mounted Flatscreen. This did the job well, easy to install. I had to mount in a metal stud, so I used two support boards in the back to distribute the weight more evenly. Expectations of item met at a fraction of the cost from competitors.",positive
"Nothing fancy, just decent quality and simple installation.  As may have been mentioned, one must discard the provided Phillips screws that the manufacturer provides to affix the bracket to the wall stud.  Use your own.  The TV I mounted with it is an older flat-panel, so it's a little heavier than the news ones.  This thing isn't fazed, and stays where I put it.",positive
Amazing how easy it is to move my 46&#34; around on this mount and able to hang off one stud. Nice quality feel to metal it is made of.,positive
"Very sturdy. The arm is very stiff at first so you have to work it lose.  However, the mount works great, just make sure you get that stud just right. I was impressed with the quality and happy with the price.",positive
"Don't have anything to really complain about.  EXCEPT there doesn't seem to be a way, or i'm missing it to tilt the TV up or down (ie. mounted high on the wall and pointed down towards the chair).  and i am quite savvy with tools/assembly/etc. And it is difficult to get to the bolt heads on the back of the TV to adjust the angle.  No reason to not buy it though.",positive
"Bought the mount for my 30&#34; Dell U3011 monitor.  It fits the Dell quite well, and I bought it for it's reach from the wall, it's ability to manipulate, and it's weight capacity.  And in all those respects, I'm quite happy.However, there is a noticeable tilt/sag to the monitor when I have the arm extended.  I'm not so concerned with sag perpendicular to the wall, as that was expected, but the rotational sag that I sometimes get.",positive
"VERY HAPPY, it looks great, I'm so happy we got it. Holds good, it is a lil hard to get it to the wall. Other then that its fine I love how we have more room in our room. My husband is so happy I ordered this, it only cost us $28 free shipping and FAST(: VERY THANKFUL TO THE SELLER.",positive
"I wasn't willing to pay $100 for simply mounting a TV, so I bought this item to give it a shot. I have no real complaints.  It holds the TV up, which is all I wanted.  It does not have smooth pivot points, so if you're planning on moving it around a lot, don't use this one, but if it's going to stay in a static area, this is your mount.",positive
"Bought NEW but I could tell right away that mine had been repackaged and refurbished.  Plus the was missing the 4 arms but had some other random hardware included.  I made mine work for my 32&#34; set and it serves it's purpose. Just wish the seller was upfront on the condition, I could have bought a used one for $5 less.",negative
This is a rather good tv mount. This tv mount works exactly as expected and described. I would buy again.,positive
"I had to use a hacksaw to cut away part of this to hang my 24&#34; LED TV in my bedroom. Other than that, seems to work fine.",neutral
Installed easy and in no time at all (finding the stud was the hardest part for me).  Articulates well with the 40&#34; TV on it. I would not hesitate to look for this brand when it is time for the next TV mount.,positive
I have two of these now in different rooms. Works well with my Samsung TV'S  for the size noted above,positive
this is a good product.  It went up easily.  I did it myself.  I wish I might have gotten one with a little more adjustment.  It's very rigid.,positive
I have purchased 3 of these wall mounts and they hold my 37 and 32 inch flat screens perfectly. I love these and highly recommend them.,positive
"Very good item; I am happy wit it, and delivery time was excellent!!  I recomended; is a good support for your LED TV. It is easy to install, and it have extra screws for different sizes TV.",positive
"This was perfect for my 24"" LED monitor, I had it up in just a few mins and with no problems.  It included a small bubble level and it also came with a 6' HDMI cable which I was not expecting.",positive
"Installed easily, has a nice long reach.  Attached a 32&#34; TV for the grandkids and it works out great. accomodates many different size TV's and was a very good price.",positive
"For the price.....can't be beat.  I have two TV's hanging in the living room.  No issues, easy to hang.  I would recommend to a friend.",positive
Works Great. Holds my 40 inch TV effortlessly. Very well built. Definitely worth the price. Easy to install TV to the mount. Has cord clips. TV can be tilted up or down and sideways. Extends from the wall 24 inches. I highly recommend this brand..,positive
"I have a 47&#34; TV and had no place to put it in my bed room. With this mount it use the space i had a poster hanging. Very easy to install, came with all hard ware.",positive
"Great Mount, so many areas of articulation. This was a great gift idea my mother loves it. I have purchased two of them and they are sturdy and give a touch of class to every room you put them in. A must have any video file or those who want to save space in a bedroom or office.",positive
This is perfect for what I needed it for. I can move the screen from side to side if I need to and I don't have the TV sitting on my desk.....,positive
have not had the opportunity to install the tv mount as of yet - will follow up once mounted in place. great price and quick shipping,positive
Why pay the $$$$ at Best Buy when you can get the same products for a fraction of the prices here.  The VideoSecu Long Arm TV Wall Mount Low Profile Full Motion works great.,positive
We bought this for a 55&#34; Vizio and it worked perfectly. I would buy it again and recommend it. Good quality.,positive
I bought the uint for a 32 &#34; Tando.  I couldn't get the parts to line up so I bought another fixed type.,neutral
"It took about 10 mins to install this TV Wall Mount with a 48 inch Samsung TV.  It does the job, there are much more expensive arms, but this does the trick.",positive
"I used this to hang my 40&#34; LCD that I bought back in 07, so it's a heavy TV that outweighs my new 50&#34;.  Everything seems to be made well, it was easy to install myself, and the TV has been hanging for 2 months now from a brick wall at it's full reach.  I can't imagine paying $100 for other TV wall mounts, as well as this one performs.",positive
you can't beat the price and the installation was simple as can be. We installed it in our office and it is perfect! no problems and was completed in a matter of minutes,positive
Used this for the bedroom. Put it in the corner but was only able to hit the stud with a couple bolts.,positive
"you can spend a ton of money on one of these, or you can buy this one.  hung a 32 inch tv with it with no problems.",positive
My flat screem computer monitor is very light and didn't need such a heavy duty mount.  The product is fine and would work for monitors much larger and heavier than my 20&#34; LED,neutral
"The mount I purchased is great. It is designed for TV's 32&#34; and under. The link here, and image are not correct. But, I really thought the mount was build well, was easy to install, and the price was fantastic.",positive
Tv has been on wall for a long time.  Hasn't fallen off.  It's metal and considerably cheaper than kits available in stores.,positive
"This TV mount I bought for just $25 easily outdoes similar ones that cost over $100! It comes preassembled, is easy to mount on the wall, and has clear instructions. It also features a wire holder and cover for the screws on the wall. The joints are a little bit stiff, but with use and maybe a drop of oil this shouldn't be a problem. Definetely a great buy at a agreat price!",positive
This device is somewhat weak even for the 46 inch TV weighing only 31lbs that I'm using it with. after some adjusting it's working ok.,neutral
Easy to install and the TV is still on the wall after three weeks! I consider this a good value for the money,positive
"Very easy to setup, simple instructions, has all the mounting hardware and fits a huge different variety of TV's with great support.",positive
Very concerned over hanging a 46&#34; tv on the wall.  Got this mount due to low price.  Very impressed.  No doubt it will handle a 30# TV.  Allows full 90 degree rotation with 21&#34; from wall to centerline at maximum extension.,positive
Another gem hidden amoungst the Amazon halls. This works well for my LED tv's. I used the heavy duty mount bolts for mounting my tv on the back porch. I hung on the sucker and it's not coming down. And I'm 190lbs!,positive
"It needs improment. I wish it has one more hole to put a screw on the wall.It looks shaky for 55 inch TV. However, it still holds it.",positive
quickly shipped to my house and mounted myself. i ordered this for my 32 inch Phillips LCD tv and for the price i paid its a great value. does the job that any other higher priced wall mounts can do. would recommand,positive
"Very good materials, very lightweight,  cheaper than others brands. I have a 47&#34; LG Led tv and it fit at 100%, and I'm capable of sell my tv, buy an 55&#34; and use the same mount without problems.",positive
"Made in china, but this time , its well made. nice and sturdy and lots of options to mount differenct type of LCD. It has a good viewing set of angles and can be adjusted just about any view you want. the value for cost here is big, since most of these sale for over 75.00, or over 100.00 at wm. im pleased with it.",positive
"Mount went up easily and seems sturdy enough.  However, adjusting the TV sometimes leaves the TV crooked.  Also, it is almost impossible to adjust tilt without using the provided tools.  Even after using the tools, we couldn't really adjust the tilt to the full amount.",positive
"Great functionality, really incredible price, and a snap to install.  Honestly, ridiculously good product - wish they were all so easy.",positive
Quick and easy installation - very solid product. Very pleased with this purchase.When in need of this type mount again I will certainly purchase this brand/model again.Great price on Amazon makes it very easy.,positive
Excellent buy! We are very pleased with this item. It performs very well. The instructions were clear. It was easy to assemble. It holds a 47&#34; TV very well.,positive
"Too Heavy and Poor weld quality .Lot of blow holes in welding, though painting was made nice to cover it or else it was made with inefficient welder. I think this is is not well designed by experts. Hope no calculations are involved in making it. Just copied the shape forms some other manufacturer.",neutral
"i bought a funky double hinged wall mount from amazon and it did not work. I went to best buy and they said to purchase this $350 wall mount they had, I snagged a pic of the measurements and extension ability from the box, came home and found this one to be near similar. Needless to say I now have my 47 in LG flat screen securely mounted and sitting pretty in the corner of my living room.",positive
"I use this arm to mount my 39 inch Vizio. I'm surprised my TV has a 100x100 mount thingy. It can tilt left and right, up and down. I do wish it swiveled the TV so that it wasn't crooked. When the bolts get loose, my TV looks crooked.",positive
Was a perfect fit for my 32&#34; flat screen TV.  I would recommend this wall mount for that size tv,positive
"Good wall mount. Sturdy and does what it is supposed to do. In fact, it even held a larger TV than what it was listed as capable of holding. I believe I mounted a 42&#34; television with this one. Not a flat-flat one either. I mounted an older heavy thick one.",positive
"This was half the price of the TV mounts at Costco and perfectly fits a Vizio 37&#34; TV for the spare bedroom. It will work with many different brands so in my book that is great. Strong, sturdy and robust.",positive
Exactly as described.Very heavy duty.Lots of parts to make any installation work.Excellent value.Fits various monitors and tvs.,positive
"I bought three of these mounts for all the bedrooms in my house. I love all three of them. All mounts have different tv's on them, One is a 50&#34;, 40&#34; and a 32&#34;. Product comes with multiple screw for different tvs. Outstanding product for the price. All tv's have been mount for a little over a year. This product is a full motion mount for $29.99!! and it is Prime!",positive
Awesome price and quality. Simple and easy to install and fully equipped for installation. If you need a swing arm mount for medium size tv this is one I'd recommend.,positive
"I mounted this in my RV and it holds a 26"" LCD TV / DVD combo.  Installation was very easy and the mount works GREAT!  I was prepared to pay 5 times the price for a mount that would work as I wanted.  I couldn't be happier.",positive
Got my TV mounted with this above my PC and its been on the wall for a year now. No problems with it holds the TV well and its study. Way cheaper than store bought and its perfect for what I got i got a 37 inch HDTV,positive
I really like the action on this mount.  I purchased a 27&#34; monitor for my wife and this mount really frees up the desktop real estate.  I would purchase again.,positive
"I have an older very heavy 36&#34; Samsung High Def TV that weighs substantially more than my new 42&#34;. I replaced my old basement CRT tv with it, installed the VideoSecu mount easily and it does the job. I was amazed, the price from Amazon was only $30 dollars and with prime I got free 2 day shipping. The original price was $149. Wow, what a reduction!",positive
"The product is good and as described.I have a 32&#34; Vizio TV and somehow, this wall mount seems to be a little too weak for my TV. I still managed to mount my TV just fine, but gets a little paranoid that it will give in within the next few months because the mount won't be able to carry it.But the full motion swing feature is amazing! Especially if you are in a larger room.",neutral
"Bought this mount for a 32inch Panasonic LED TV. The mount may look cheap, but I found it to be extremely sturdy and a great buy for the price. I strongly recommend it to everyone.",positive
,positive
"Very solid...we mounted our flat panel in the bedroom. Like the tipping feature and love the articulating feature.We checked prices at stores, big boxes, etc. best price of all including Costco...",positive
Easy to attach. Easy to adjust. Very Solid and secure. Used on a clients 29&#34; LED with built in DVD.,positive
I have my 32 inch Tv on the wall and it works great. Easy to install and came with all the parts. The screws that it comes with for the TV will not fit but you can buy some for 2 dollars.,positive
"For the money you can't go wrong. Yes, it has a litlle play in the mechanism but, you can adjust your mounting to accomodate that. It works great and frees up counter space. I would do it all again. Why spend 3 times more.",positive
I love this mount! All the adjustments for tilt and extension are awesome! Holds a Sony 32in Ex-3000 just fine even fully extended. Even bought another. A++Mike,positive
"I have this mounted on my wall in my editing studio.  It holds a 27"" LCD monitor (about 20-25lbs).  It's been up for a week and I don't expect that it will fall down anytime soon.",positive
"My students and I used to huddle around laptops to discuss projects. Now I have a 47&#34; TV for display and this mount makes it possible to put it on any wall and swivel it in any direction depending on how many people need to see the screen. Really stable, no wiggling",positive
"It is a good value, but is not top notch quality. If you extend both arms in the same direction, the TV (30 inch) tilts. However if the arm goes right, then left, the play in the hinges offset each other and it works great.",positive
"The mount itself seems fine, it just didn't work with the Phillips tv we bought....the 'x' arm things did not line up and if they did then the 'x' parts would have covered the holes for the inputs...........we ended up using one we had had around here.......seems to be built well though and sturdy",neutral
"It is up know and should work fine, but it was hard to get it to fit my TV due to the bulge on the bottom, but I made it work and it is on the wall.",positive
"Very strong for any tv, but I wish that it was little longer I am very happy with it and very strongly recommended.",positive
"Easy install!! Looks great and works great for what we need!! Purchased for game room, took 5 min. to install and 1 min. to set TV on. Great!!",positive
"The mount works, but it is unrefined compared to other brands out there. Purchased because it was on sale. just ok.",neutral
Works great for a cheap mount. Worked great on a 32&#34; Emerson LCD tv. Does everything as advertised! Can tighten or loosen joints for easier movement.,positive
We needed something to Extend our tv away from the hot pipe for the winter and this wall mount did the trick. It went up with no a problems. It worked out very well!,positive
"its a little flimsy and not the easiest to put together, for the price it works.  But for the quality i'd go with Cheetah.",neutral
It works for the tv I bought but I had to use some of my own washers for the screws.  I thought it would have everything.,positive
"I have mounted a 42 inch old LCD. Easy to install. Easy to swivel, there is tilt option but it has to be locked by nuts(it can not be changed without loosing the nuts).",positive
I wanted to put my mac in the wall and leave it. This does that well.  I don't move it often it seems strong and well built. If you want to move it a lot get something different you have to keep an Allen wrench and a crescent wrench in the desk drawer if you plan on moving it a lot. The articulation is sketchy. For my uses and the cheap price this was perfect.,positive
"I have purchased a total of 4 HDTV wall mounts from the VideoSecu companyand they are all quality products at a very reasonable price.-Tilt TV Mount: for stationary TVs up to 65 inches.-Articulating:  corner mount for SMALL TVs-Long Arm:  corner or high mobility mount for LARGER TVsAll of them are excellent products, and very easy to install.",positive
"Received this item quickly and well packaged (But not so well that I was infuriated trying to open it)Everything was in perfct order. Strong, handsome appearance. Installation Kit is perfectly in order and gives a ton of options for different senarios.  Couldn't possibly be happier with this product.",positive
"Could offer a little more in flexibility of installation, but once in place the set can be placed in just the right position repeatedly.",positive
The directions stink. Just remember the spacers go under the arms if you have to use them and you will be ok.,positive
It is better than spending twice the money on this going into a brick and mortar store. Was very pleased.,positive
"This item didn't disappoint. It's sturdy, has all the screws included for different flat screen models and yes, it works well.",positive
This worked perfect.  The universal design would fit 99.9% of the TV's as advertised.  Easy to mount and very durable.,positive
"had a couple of guys put this up for me, but they said it was easy to install. I like the fact that I can move it around easily and tilt it anyway I want it to be.",positive
This product is user friendly and versatile.It is easy to install and comes with everything needed for installation.Adding bidding could drill and bit,positive
it was so easy to install.  the instructions were simple and so was the process.  i was putting off the project for fear.  i should have hung the TV long ago.,positive
works great was pretty easy to put up and does the trick. it is my sons room and really works great.,positive
"I am very happy with this affordable wall mount for my Sony 32"" Internet TV. One nice feature ist that you can swivel the mounted TV depending on where you are seated.",positive
"I have a 26"" LCD monitor mounted on unit.Seems sturdy enough, would prefer a more fluid motion and a way to adjust the pivot of the screen without tools.  As it is I keep it loose and it is reasonbly adjustable.For the price I certanily can't complain and would recommend this unit.",positive
"Easy to install, and works great. Television moves with ease and always feels secure. Doesn't loosen over time like other television mounts.",positive
This was for a 32 inch LCD.  Easy to install and works great.  I am very satisfied with this wall mount.,positive
"Fits many different size TV's,  is very solid, and was easy to install.  I would recommend to anyone is even slightly handy.",positive
"I'm using this with my 32"" tv and I love it. The price is significantly lower than what you can find for monitor wall mounts in the retail stores (walmart, best buy).I found this to be an easy install and very secure. The swivel is smooth and I can orient my television perfectly. It also has plenty of VESA mount patterns so it will hold just about any TV.",positive
"For such a cheap mount, it works well. I installed in in about 20 minuets and use it to hole a 32"" Vizio LED.",positive
"This was a present for myself, my son installed it, in about 25 minutes, and I couldn't be happier.  I wasn't sure this was for me as it for my bedroom, but my husband and I love it.  So easy to move the TV no matter where you are in the room.  A great buy.",positive
Mounting the TV after mounting on wall can be a handful.  It would have been nice to have some type of slide in mount for the TV so you did not have to hold it while putting in 4 screws.  That would make DIY one person installation easier.,positive
"When we first bought our bedroom tv, we looked at the mounts in the store and almost fell over from shock at the prices.  This is one of the best prices I have found on mounts.  This mount went up easy and moves in all directions to get the perfect viewing angle.  it comes with everything you need but the drill and tv!  You won't be disappointed with this brand.",positive
"The fact that the pivot point on this TV mount was not built straight caused the TV to tilt slightly when it was swung out.  there is no adjustment for it, so i had to make a choice for the tv to either be straight and level when it was pushed against the wall, or when it was out.  i do not recommend this wall mount.to it's benefit though, it was reasonably sturdy and easy to install.",negative
This is mounted in a doorway between two rooms in my basement with a 40 inch TV attached to it.  I can move it to either room and still keep the doorway open plenty wide enough to pass through.  Perfect for my needs.,positive
"Sturdy and durable craftsmanship. Bought for my grandma in Mexico, had it installed and works great. Has awesome mobility to enjoy your television from countless angles in your room.",positive
If you want a wall mount that is universal and can be moved in all directions this is the one to get.  My 42&#34; Samsung 3D tv mounted easily and the extensions were not required.  I mounted it to a stud and it seems to be very secure.  I am able to swing the tv to watch from my bed or from the lazyboy chair without a problem.,positive
"Great wall mount at a great price.  Already fully assembled out of the box and seems built to last.  I really like the swivel and tilt as we need it when laying down in the bedroom.  Easy instructions (I'm not a carpenter).  I used this on a 32"" Samsung LED TV.",positive
"got this to hang a 32"" sony lcd in my bedroom.  used my stud finder to locate the studs, drilled 6 pilot holes and hung it up.  and extra set of hands is helpful when hanging the mount and mounting the tv.  holes on mount lined up perfectly with my tv.  screws fit just right.no complaints.",positive
used it for vizio 42&#34; tv. easy to install. fit perfectly. what is there else to say? strongly recommend for everyone.,positive
"I thought this was a great value for a wall mount.  I have installed a 32 inch tv in my bathroom with this unit.  It worked well with the Visio TV that I bought.  It looked it it could accomodate many other tvs because there were a variety of holes on the mounting bracket.  Is it the best quality ever, no.  It is decent quality, and it worked well for me.",positive
my tv! Couldn't ask for more. Thanks. These reviews require too many words. I could have said what I meant in three.,positive
"This TV mount is easy to install.  Just follow the directions included.  I installed this near the ceiling and I'm using every bit of the 15 degree downward tilt.  Properly installed, the product is rock solid.  I installed a 32"" tv on it.  I know it can hold much more.  The articulating arms are easily adjustable and if you want to tighten it down and lock it in position you can do that, too.",positive
"This is the second VideoSecu product I have ordered. They are rock-solid, and with the range of fasteners and extra hardware they include in the package, it's hard to imagine any speaker or TV that these systems won't fit.",positive
"For the price it can't be beat.  The mount is strong and sturdy.  Two sets of hands are mandatory for mounting, three would be ideal.  Once up though, it's better than most of our friends mounts.  It has full articulation, and I can swing the arm out and angle it towards my kitchen.  This is highly important while cooking buffalo wings and trying to keep tabs on football games.",positive
I am using this with a 40 inch Samsung smart tv.  The extended bars were not needed.  This is very easy to mount to a wall stud with just two bolts.  Many bolts are provided to fit with your television.  It is very sturdy and able to be positioned in many different ways.  Highly recommended.,positive
"Do not listen to other reviewers, screws that this came with are concrete only, there are no wood or dry wall screws. You will!!!! need a stud finder!!! There are 8 holes in total on a mounting plate, so it is plenty enough if you hit the center of a stud. Sturdy,good looking. There is a whole set of machine screws for(my guess)all TV types plus couple of tools that you will need.",positive
I purchased this mount based on others comments beforehand and i appreciate the guidance. The problem with wall mounting flat screen TV's is to make sure the hole pattern of the mount lines up with the hole pattern on the TV you buy. I'm using this mount with a VIZIO E320ME 32-inch and it works perfect.,positive
"Its sturdy, holds my tv really good, its adjustable & really really easy to install. An excellent product. I would definitely recommend it.",positive
"I got this for mounting a tv on the wall in my home office. Price was good and it worked. The adjustments on it work well, and it has a gizmo to hold the cables in place. Don't hesitate to buy. I think I am using this with a 38&#34; tv.",positive
It does the job and it wasn't too hard to install so i'm a happy tv viewer. Nothing bad to say about it. Came with a bunch of bolt options for different make and model TV's,positive
I have this wall mount installed outside. I have a 32&#34; hanging on it in my backyard. Easy to install and have had no problems what so ever..,positive
"We had to &#34;shave&#34; a little off the wall mount plate to get this product to work for us, but after doing so it has served it's purpose on our 24&#34; tv.",neutral
This unit has worked perfectly in holding a 40&#34; TV in an extended position for months - without sagging or failing.  Very happy with the purchase,positive
I bought this mount for our bedroom in order to swing and tilt the TV based on our viewing angle.  In order to move it I had to loosed the screws each and every time.  I had it connected to a 27in vizio LCD which is pretty light.  Could not find a tension to keep it where we wanted it.  Had to return,negative
"Worked great. Easy mounting and setup. 2007 Vizio 42&#34; LCD hung perfectly. It is a heavier TV, around 50lbs and it mounted up great.",positive
"Now I have like four different kendels and I am such a Fan.  My darling Daughter n law requested this.  No way, says I.  Then I see these reconditioned ones with a warranty, cases n protective films, new chargers and 16 gb HD.  Had to get it or her.  Only cause she gave me the worlds best gran babies ...and I guess I love her like mad too.",positive
"I love nooks. Kindle fire is OK, but nooks are easy to root and install cyanogen mod foe a full android experience.",positive
"this is such a great tablet. one time didn't work. acted weird really weird. needed to be cleaned. now I keep eyeglass cleaning clothes (disposable) for it. has worked like a charm since. hooks up to the computer without the shelves going away. book reading is great too. I use it for an ereader with games that I sometimes play, but mostly as an ereader. recommended.",positive
Great product  works just as described have had no problems with it since I got it thanks for a great product,positive
"I do not understand people, they are comparing this $100 tablet with $500 Ipad, of course it is not gonna be the same. I would recommend this tablet to everyone especially for the kids.",positive
"The nook tablet is great.I have used it to check e-mail,browse and look at books,and also transferred one from my p.c.I like the way it will sync with the direction its rotated,and I love the touch screen.Thanks Amazon!",positive
Check your SN with Barnes & Noble's 800 number. Mine was used from BuyAccessories. I paid $70 too much as used is under $30 these days.,negative
"I have tried the IPad, the Kindle, and the Sony, and nothing has worked better than this Nook Tablet. It's light, the screen resolution is amazing for movies, and the applications I use work beautifully. Even the speakers are excellent for what they are. No complaints at all.",positive
"This thing has been through so much. Closed in doors, thrown across the room, been the object of desire in a toddler tug of war and it still keep working. It i just fantastic! To any one complaining that he app store for barns and noble is too small I say just sideload google play with the root kit. It is easy and doecker skills to do.",positive
the nook color is a great tablet. it sometimes is very slow but it is still a good tablet. i have dropped it a few times and it is still okay.,positive
"The customer support people at Barnes & Noble site are clueless. They are useless for providing help. If you buy tablet, you are on your own. In the store it is the same.",negative
I love using this. It's light and easy and fast! LOVE that is has hte capability of Google Play on it! So hard to find things that are compatible,positive
my wife was tired of dragging books around she loves the covienence of the tablet and can make the text larger,positive
"Rooted, and cyanogenmod installed, works awesome.  The Nook Tablet has a bit more memory than the original Nook Color, so that's why I got this one.",positive
"The B&N Nook is a great device. The hardware in it makes sure there is no lag or waits while watching videos, reading books, or surfing the web. The builtin apps are great, as well as the overall layout and options. The major drawback is the inability to load 3rd party apps...but roll back to firmware 1.4.0 and load all you want before upgrading. Or root it (although Amazon Instant Video will not work after rooting).",positive
It accepts up to 32gb micro sd cards but does not work properly with a 32gb card. Mine would not boot because the card used too much energy. That was the only issue I had. Customer service told me to unplug the card before booting up and then insert the card. I returned it and purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 plus.Funny thing is Barnes and Noble rrjected my review.,negative
"Great Product, Great Sale, I love this Product, and my children will too I cant wait til Christmas to Give them their present.",positive
"I got this for my little girl, as she filled up her 8gb tablet with games. We just love the Nook HD tablets. The fact they have Google Play, and you can change the background to a nice picture, makes these tablets superior in most ways, to the Kindle Fire. Yes, the Fires have their own advantages (we have some) but overall, we prefer the Nook HDs.",positive
,positive
"Why pay to be restricted, I simply didn't see the benefit with all of the other tablets out there having apps that perform exactly the same tasks. Just decided to go a cheaper route and I am so glad I did.Maybe I would consider the Nook again if it is expanded beyond a e-reader.",negative
We have both the hd and the hd+ but I love the hd because it is lightweight and very portable. All my nooks are converted to android and work very well.,positive
"It is too bad that the Nook HD hasn't received more kudos. To be honest, I knew it had a great screen, a fast proce fast processor, great battery life, and oh so light and easy to handle. But, I did wait for a means for rooting the Nook HD to become available. Now the tablet lives up to all its potential. Rooting is quite easy and it is a great tablet",positive
"The Nook preformed perfectly and was easy to set up. I checked lots of ratings before I ordered it, and they were all good.This was my first tablet so I did not realize that it did not have some of the specific features I was looking for. I did return it. I must say though that the camera on the Nook was much better than camera on my new one.",positive
"Excellent display quality. It runs fast, and does have more memory than its predecesor. The size is appropriate for my day to day needs.",positive
"I bought my wife a Nook for Christmas two years ago, and she has used the heck outof it, so I have always wanted one for myself. When I saw the price break on this oneI had to act! It meets all my expectations.",positive
"Purchased as a Christmas Gift for my son.  He loves it.  Best gift (according to him).  We loaded a few of his faborite games and downloaded some books.  He loves to read, and hasn't put this down since unwrapping it.Hightly recommend.",positive
"I assumed that I had the 16gb model but the box was misbranded and my bad for not paying attention,too late to take back to the store but it is still a very good tablet and the memory can still be expanded by sd card. I have since rootedmy tablet and it is great! I do have the 16gb one after all.",positive
The Nook 7&#34; 8GB Wifi tablet was a Christmas gift for my husband. He had a  plain Nook for reading. This upgrade seemed logical because he already had a Nook account. The new Nook takes cards he already had. He loves it.,positive
This nook has a very nice format and is very easy to operate and view.  The only draw back is the Battery life is terrible.  I am charging this unit twice a day.  My former Simple Touch only needed charging once a month &#34;with the wifi ON&#34; all the time.  I would NOT recommend this product.,neutral
the nook takes forever to turn the page the battery life sucks it always falls out of its case (not sure if its the case or the nook) i have tried both nook and kindle i recommend the kindle over the nook,negative
This is the nook i dont like..it doesnot habe light to let you read at night but have a colored screen to navigate..this is poorly conceptualized as ereader..not user friendly too..,negative
"I loved using this nook reader. The bottom touch screen made navigation very convenient, and the reading screen was also very nice.We are now switching to the all-new touch-screen nook that just came out. Yay! :)",positive
Beware. I bought this used and the person or company I bought it from didn't have the common sense to de-register it from the previous owner. That should be done before you sell it. No excuse.,negative
I ordered this product and it was not what I wanted. I ordered the wrong one. I contacted the company and returned the item with no problems. I ordered and new one from the same company and cannot wait to get it! Thanks!,positive
"Very good product overall.  Manipulation is somewhat clumbersome, but after use for a few hours, it is ok.  I understand that the new version (color) fixes these issues.  The display really does give the feel of paper.  Only negative is no backlighting for use in very low to no light conditions.Overall love the product.",positive
in my honest opinion nook is unfinished product.none of my technical books in pdf format i was able to read due to pdf reader rendering formulas all over the screen with middle-size font.i am able to see formulas in small font but then the rest of text is unreadable.formula rendering in medium font is a mess however text is readable. i would have expected developer of the device spent more time on fine-tuning the text rendering on ebook reader.,negative
Not worth saving a few bucks. Go with an iPad.,negative
"An eReader without e-ink? Really?eReaders are devices dedicated to reading, and thus the main inconvenience they should avoid is eye-strain.By introducing a backlit eBook, B&N; removed the key point of eReaders.If you need a device that has a backlit screen (and can afford a $283 device), why wouldn't you pay the extra $200 to get an iPad, which does the job much more efficiently?Please, correct me if I'm wrong, because I really don't get the point of this device.Thanks.",neutral
"I bought the color Nook for a family member for Christmas. If I didn't already have the iPad and prefer Apple products, I would have purchased one of these for myself. I think it makes a much more user friendly product than Android tablets, and the price is good. Combine a good product at a great price with an already large library available from Barnes & Noble, and you have a real competitor to the iPad and Kindle.",positive
"I bought it for my PDF library and to surf the net on the go. It turns out that it won't read non-western/latin pdf documents, unless: a word document transformed into a pdf.",neutral
I have never been a big fan of reading until I purchased the nook.  I have trouble putting it down.  I'm either playing games or reading.  Absolutely love it.,positive
"I have had my Nook for 5 months and the only issue I have had with it is the charger cord went bad, but I called the toll free number and they are sending me a new one for free. I'm am lost without it! I have an Easy Reader from Nook, but this is so much better.",positive
"am about to get a micro card with android c7 and use it as a reader and tablet.  this let's me get rid of my netbook,nook wi/fi and router which free's up space and let's me use it anywhere in the house.  hope it's a good move.  cape guy",positive
"My friend loves her nook.I purchased it as a gift to my friend,already own one.",positive
"My wife loves this, and it's one of the best Christmas presents you can give to someone who truly likes to read.",positive
"I really like Amazon and wanted this for my wife for Christmas but why would the change MORE than buying direct from B&N;?I like the service and everything I have experienced with Amazon but I would not pay $65 MORE (?!) than going direct to B&N.;Sorry this time Amazon, I just went to B&N;.",positive
The nook provides a lot of hidden features.. I read a couple reviews and Im still learning more about the product. Challenge is to find parental control,positive
"Wife loves it , uses it daily, works good , the only problem to her is when you charge it thier is no indictor light to say when it is fully charged.",positive
"it constantly acts up.  i try to use it for my textbooks but when i try to turn the page it glitches and zooms in.  the touch screen randomly clicks things by itself, also doesnt allow returns.  would not recommend",negative
Got this for my sons 15th birthday he loves it a great gift for anyone great price and it came fast love amazon,positive
"I got this a week-and-a-half ago and put CyanogenMod on it and it runs smoothly. Nothing is instantaneous, but everything is quick.",positive
"Purchased for my son's school A/R Reading Program as a prize for his school.  This is the third one purchased, at the A/R program's leaders' request.  The look on their face when the one, who wins, finds out what they get!  Totally amazement!  Would purchase again!",positive
I gave it to my granddaugter for christmas with a gift certificate. My daughter says she loves it & it helps her improve on her reading skills.,negative
"It came early which is nice, it didnt come with a box which was already described in the details. but It was nice, came as described and worked fine.",positive
"You can get this for about $40 less at B&N directly (plus tax), or at that same lower price, without tax, at their site.",negative
"The Nook Color is OK as an e-book reader and the apps Barnes and Noble offer are OK, but I installed a 16gb SD card with the Android OS and this thing is smokin.  I can watch Netflix, listen to local radio stations and you can get any of the apps in the world, not the just few Barnes and Noble offer.",positive
this was a life saver for me after my wifes operation it kept her occupied we still have it and she loves great investment,positive
"I don't know why people make fun of these I just happen to love mine. It's very versatile, easy to use, you can add more space, and it's not too big. And it seems like they are getting huge now. I get hours of enjoyment out of it from reading, doing puzzles, playing games and listening to music. And mine is used!",positive
The on-off button is located so that you will frequently turn off tbe machine by accident. The power button should be recessed. Same for volumn control.,neutral
exactly what my daughter wanted.  she is more than tickled with this reader.  She will use it for hours and hours,positive
"Once I replace it's crippled version of Android OS, and replaced it with a Cyanogenmod version of Android, I found the tablet to be very capable. The only negative is that it is a little on the heavy side.",positive
I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE my Nook Color. One of the main reasons I'm so happy with it is because I purchased the micro SD card that turns your Nook from an e-reader into an Android tablet. It works perfectly! Now I can enjoy the Nook ebooks but also have access to all the Android apps and features.,positive
"Ordered the e Reader for Christmas last year. As of today, my daughter is using it and loving it. She says, no regret she loves it.",positive
I have had my Nook Color for about three months now and I must say it has been one of the easiest devices to root.  This is a great bargain for $249 once you turn it into a full fledged Android tablet.  Forget about Nooky Froyo and go directly for Cyanogen mod).  You can then install the B&N Nook reader app and Amazon's own Kindle App (along with 1000's of other apps like Angry Birds).,positive
I bought this used but I was pleasantly surprised that it was like new. I rooted it and made itA Droid pad. I'm using it right now to write this. I like it better than my ipad.,positive
"Bought two of these for my daughters and they both have issues when reading books. The pages jump after a few minutes of reading and the menu screens pop up and down constantly. Power off and on to resolve but it keeps happening. I'm returning these today and getting a Kindle. Oh yeah and it locks up totally every so often and again you have to power it down, very disappointed. Barnes and noble support is terrible",negative
I purchased for my wife as a gift and she loves it. Product met all of her needs and  she loves being able to just select a book and download it without any hassle. Battery lasts a good amount of time and I can now sleep at night without a flashlight beaming in my face on accident!,positive
my girlfriend uses it every single day. i bought it for her as a christmas present. and she loves it.,positive
"I loved the nook. I eventually bought an ipad and gave this to my nephew, he still loves and uses it everyday.",positive
I am dis-satisfied with b&n nook this product is only good at their site. and the choice of books and apps is poor compared to kindle,negative
"Haven't had it but a few weeks, but I am learning how to download from the library, etc.  love how light it is and that it will tuck away in a purse for easy reading anywhere.  No operating problems so far.  Would recommend it for home or away&#34;",positive
"OK, I got this thing and plugged it in as instructed, to which it responded by doing Nothing.  After some further research, I found that it likes to be updated.  I followed the instructions on the Nook website and downloaded the newest version and ... Nothing.  The little monster came back just as dumb as before.  It does show cute screens, but not yet anything productive.  So far, Not Impressed.",negative
"I have had this a few days and I love it! It arrived earlier than expected which is a plus! I have never had a nook before so I'm unsure whether my problem is an issue with my nook or all nooks but the power/sleep button on the back is loose feeling and is hard to press. Other than that, I have barely put this thing down since it arrived (: good thing I'm on winter break from school!",positive
"We have only been using the product for a couple of weeks now, but it is working great.  My wife and my daughter both love it and find it very easy to use.",positive
"The ""newest model"" is the Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight, and not this model.  It may be the newest without a light, but it's not the ""newest"".",positive
"Great product, easy to use and set up--after comparing pros and cons this was the one for me. I especially liked that I could download books from my community library and other sites. I wasn't tied just to a brand name download. Shipped quickly too.",positive
Satisfied with this purchase. The Nook was brand new in an open box. Works like a gem. Very happy customer!,positive
"very very good value for this reader, and I am grateful for the quick exchange they made when the first unit developed a problem right away.  They immediately sent a replacement.  Immediately.",positive
Wife bought this for her elderly mother - but she couldn't quite get the hang of using it (tech challenged)... My wife has been using it instead and seems to like it pretty well... All is good :),positive
"Gave this to my granddaughter, who loves it.  She uses it all the time and loves the touch feature and ease of downloading.",positive
"I dont know why I bought this tablet, just only one day using it and I stored it in a place where it continues stored... I dont like the screen... it reflects light from many sources (sun, bulbs, etc) despite the type of technology used in the screen...the size is no convenient, I think a bigger one good be better... well, this is my opinion about this product...",negative
"This arrived as described, packaged well, and worked well. The only issue I have ever had with them is its not as user friendly as it could be. I had to go to online blogs to find the rest of the steps to download an eBook. Whether it was from Barnes and Noble or the library.",neutral
Bought this as a gift for my husband.  He didn't think he would use an e-reader.  The Nook is so easy to set up and use.  I have one too and we both read with them all the time.,positive
While it doesn't have a light and its screen has been far surpassed by other readers throughout the years. However since it uses android you can easily root it and install apps that allows you to read Kindle books and pretty much anything else your heart desires. Even can play Angry Birds if you really wanted to.,positive
"My screen stopped working a week out of warranty.  Apparently, this is a common issue with the Nook Simple Touch.  Customer service told me that Barnes & Noble is aware of this issue but they do not plan to repair or replace anything.  This is not the way to treat customers.  I am canceling all my pre-orders and I will try a different ereader.",negative
"Ordered for a freind. As far as I know, his daughter is happy with it. I guess you could call him.",positive
"This is a sold update to the older nook, but gez you have to hit the webs just to find out you need to charge it OVERNIGHT in a WALL PLUG only before first usage AND that it MUST be turned on before trying to connect to windows.  Now knowing these two VERY IMPORTANT points, I can enjoy my &#34;Nook 2&#34;.",positive
this thing was a paperweight from the mint I opened it. and the customer service is just awful. it wont let you go any father unless you register the device and since it would not let me do it I could not use it. went back to the Kindle,negative
I was very hesitant to buy a book reader because I really like holding my books.  I changed my mind when I bought a bigger bookcase and filled up immediately.  This Nook is great.  It is so much lighter than my IPad to read with.  I find that I use it a lot.,positive
"In my opinion, the Nook Simple Touch is the best e-reader on the market because... well... it's simple. No distractions of email or social media, it lets me immerse myself in a book and I love it!",positive
Readability in Sunlight is super even when the sun is directly hitting the screen; can't be beat! The blacks are great and the contrasting white whites really helps these old eyes of mine! I like the Android operation too.,positive
"If you only want to read, this is fine. The newer models access the web, have apps, play games, do email and color. This model is only print and only black and white.",positive
good reader. uploads books fast. I do not do wifi on this because I have heard bad things about the updates. also has problems if hooked up to a computer will take the shelves away. I have a lot of books so this is a big bad thing for me. But still is good.,positive

"Bought this to replace a Sony have had for a couple years and am pleasantly surprised.Arrived on time and works beautifully.Only reason i did not give it a 5 star rating is that, for a basic ereader with WiFi, it should have had a basic browser instead of only connecting to the Nook store.",positive
"I absolutely love it. While it doesn't have the bells and whistles of the other Ebook Readers, it does exactly what it is meant to do. It allows you to read books. I bought this as gateway into ebook technology and I love it. The unit fits into your hands nicely and is not heavy. The buttons on the side are helpful in turning the pages. It charges fast and the battery lasts a decent amount of time.",positive
I waited until June 2010 until I bought a nook. So far I am loving it. I love the page turning swipe feature. Those that gave the nook 1 star are the ones who got theirs with the 1.1 firmware. The firmware is now up to 1.4 and the price has dropped to $199.,positive
"Pros: Very nice display , clear than Sony Prs-600S. 5 Star for this.Cons: Touch screen not responsive, navigation is not good. It is a stupid to have two screen for read and menu. waste spaces. Software looks buggy, very irresponsive even if updated the firmware to latest 1.4.3., 2 star for this.Final star 3.",neutral
"This is a good item. Even though it's old, it's sticks to what an reader should be. It really is good for just reading books. It has great battery and the 3G works everywhere",positive
"perfect, as described Thank you",positive
"Great Product Great Sale, I just Love this product, and my children will too I want one for myself this is suppose to be their christmas gift but I want one now.",positive
It's a fine tablet.  The screen is excellent.  The speakers are very good.  The interface is a little clunky but easy to use.  It does just what I want it to do and it does it well.,positive
I couldn't have asked for a better product! I upgraded from the Nook Color to the HD and I am super happy!!!,positive
I had to put generic Android on it because Barnes and Noble had it so hamstrung. Should have gone with the new 7&#34; Nexus. No built in GPS turned out to be a major lack.,negative
I bought this for a friend who studies programming using e-books while he's at work (repairing cars) - and he loves it.,positive
"Bought it for my wife to use primarily as a reader but also to occasionally access the net and read email when not at her computer.  She absolutely loves it.  It's the perfect product for her.  The reader portion is excellent.  The web graphics are vivid and colorful.  It has great functionality for such a small machine and last but not least, the price is right.",positive
"Exactly the same as from Barnes and Noble but less expensive. It has been working great and doing more than I even needed. Wow! Arrived on time, I was a bit worried about the packaging as it came in a bubble envelope in its Nook box, but everything was fine.",positive
She has been using a Nook e-reader for several years. I decided to get her the tablet because she wants to read email and browse as well as read her ebooks.  Her little smart phone was just too small to use.  Now she's using it regularly to browse and can easily read her gmail.,positive
This is a very good tablet for reading..satisfied with my purchase..very handy and easy to tucked in your purse or in your hands..just convenient for my need..,positive
Very good product for those with a Nook book collection. Works well with apps. All google play apps are available except for those requiring a camera.  I brought two units for my children and there are lots of apps and books for them. The Nook HD will read certain books allowed. My two units ended up being defective and kept crashing. Was able to return both with no problems.,positive
Am tired of non-standard charging cables...  I like micro USB and the majority of hand held electronic devices use micro USB now.  Why is the NOOK HD using a non standard 30 Pin charging cable?  We returned the NOOK to Barnes and Noble!,negative
"Just want you to know that I did not get this tablet from Amazon, got it from Walmart but I must say that the tablet is great.  I searched it on Amazon but because it was near X-Mas I went to Walmart and bought one so as to ensure I would have it by X-Mas.  The Nook Tablet looks and works just fine, was a gift for my granddaughter.",positive
My Daughter bought these for her children through me. They love them.  I would recommend them to everyone that likes this kind of stuff.,positive
My husband had one and I got this one for Christmas. It keeps all my books and crafting patterns in one place.,positive
I bought this tablet for someone as a gift. I was so confused about which one I should get them. I definitely chose correctly for them.,positive
"This is good product compared to its price. I'm using it for watching video, writing documents, and web searching. It's perfect for my needs, and I upload CM 1.0, so now I'm using it with Android... It's so good. :-)",positive
"Brand new condition. Fast shipping. this tablet is the best deal on a 9&#34; size that you can get. Way better than what the same size cost in my last husband.Easy to use, lots of storage for apps even the large ones. PLUS will hold additional scancard. Beats the Kindle (sorry Amazon) by a mile in functionality, weight and price.",positive
Got this for my nook (since B&N didn't have it!) Good price and exactly what I needed. It also seems to be a better made product than the one that came with my color nook.,positive
"The original chargers I had for the Nooks were dying, as in literally falling apart after a couple years. Hopefully these replacement chargers will last just as long, if not longer.",positive
This is the third adapter that I have tried other than buying direct from B&N.  This adapter is quality made and works excellent with the device.  It is better made than the original.  Great value.,positive
WORKS AS DESCRIBED .. OWNED 3 YEARS NOW AND WORKS WELL.. NO COMPLAINTS HERE.  GREAT PRODUCT AT AN EXCELLENT PRICE,positive
Since it's a cable for digital data... shielding isn't a big issue with HDMI. Use it for my satellite boxes for 1080i HD plus audio. No problems.,positive
only had it for a few weeks but have not noticed one problem for this price compared to other hdmi cables i feel like I won big on this item.,positive
"It's not top of the line by any means, but certainly a good value for the price.",positive
I bought this cable to hook up an Apple Tv.  Save your money on the expensive cable and buy this one..Works Great!,positive
"This item does exactly what it says it will do - and at a good price.  If I had a complaint, it was that I did not purchase a longer one for what I need it for.  Of course, this is more of my fault versus the product.But, if the length works for you, and you need a HDMI cable, this will fill the job and do it very well.",positive
"Wire is heavy grade, but as with all cables you can't really tell how strong the connectors are till they break.",positive
Item was As described in post. Simple and just what I needed. Great price too. Actually bought two. Good value,positive
"With Amazon Prime, these things are only $4! They arrived so quickly, just in time for me to hookup my computer and other entertainment systems into my new TV. They're fantastic!",positive
"This cable works as advertised.  No need to spend more for an HDMI cable.  There is no difference in picture quality between this cable and brands costing much, much more.",positive
they are inexpensive and they get the job done.  i'm glad i got them. i use them with my wdtv at work.love 'em and if i lose them i'll just buy another set or 2.,positive
"I don't have too much exciting to say about the cable.  I'm not a videophile by any means, but the cable works, I don't see any problems with it, and it is a bunch cheaper than I could get from Best Buy...",positive
A cable is a cable. It's going to work 99.99% of the time no matter where you buy it. But Amazon always has the best prices!,positive
this cable works FANTASTIC and i didnt have to pay $60 for it. i highly recommend!! so glad i gave a cheap price hdmi a shot.,positive
The price was right and I cannot discern a difference between this cable and a higher priced cable I have in my possession. Maybe I'll see a difference when I upgrade to 4K products.,positive
"Bought this to replace a $13, 3 foot cable bought from Target which would cause picture glitches and dropouts regularly - this one works flawlessly, is twice as long and a fraction of the price!",positive
"Purchased this a few years ago and forgot to write a review. Needless to say I'm still using it and have no problems. I purchased this back when the cheapest HDMI cord was $30.00. Great buy, I recommend it.",positive
"Much cheaper than buying in a local store, about one fourth the price. After actually using it, I realize that having a longer one would make some tasks I need it for much easier.",positive
"brought back my IPOD video 30G back life, easy to replace.  Only hard part is to get the case opened.",positive
"Awesome replacement for an ipod video 5th gen 30gb hard drive, saved me the cost of buying a brand new iPod.",positive
"THIS ARTICLE WITH ALL MY EXPECTATIONS FULFILLED RECOMMEND IT BECAUSE THE PACKAGING AND JURISDICTION ENTRAG CORRECT, IN ADDITION TO RUN FERFECION",positive
"My iPod video had hard drive failure.  I used iFixit instructions and this drive to make it work.Make sure you plug the cable in the right way.  Drive is shielded on both sides unlike the original so you have to look carefully.  If you get it wrong, iPod will tell you there is battery failure, but there isn't, it's just the drive in backwards.  I flipped it around and it worked, no harm done.",positive
"Not much to say.  Dropped right into my Zune in place of the original drive.The cable release tab is extremely fragile, but the drive works just fine even though I broke the tab.. oops!",positive
"My daughter's 30GB Ipod Classic needed a new Hard Drive and this worked great...about 5 minutes to install, plug in to Itunes and it set up by itself.",positive
"Works great, but wasn't what i expected .  Thanks  Sent it back. Sorry. Maybe it will be good for a conferance room, but not for singing too record.",negative
"Money well-spent.  I love this little speaker/microphone.  The sounds is very clear.  Volume buttons work great, and the microphone is great!!!  I love this item!!!",positive
I use it on Microsoft Lynch for telecoms.  The speaker is a little &#34;tinny&#34; but the mic works well without echoing.,positive
"I love this produtct.1. Echo canceling is working perfectry.2. It is avairable for room meeting.3. 3.5mm headphone jack.I bought it totaly more than 10, and I will buy more for my friends...",positive
"I got this for my computer to use with my magic jack and I got no sound or nothing.  It may not be compatible with magic jack but more like Skype.  Since I don't have Skype, there is no way of knowing if it would work with Skype or compatible with it.",negative
"We were very happy with this purchase at first, but some of the buttons have stopped working after using it a few times a week for a couple months.  The volume buttons no longer work and the volume can't be adjusted on the laptop, so we have to suffer through a blasting speaker in order to gain the benefits of the microphone, which also seems as if it may be starting to have intermittent problems.",neutral
I would love to buy this movie as I have been to Hannibal Missouri and been to all the Mark Twain atractions.To buy this movie would be a real treat but if it's Pan&Scan forget it! I dont buy full screen movies! Unless it's made for TV.I think MGM should of included a widescreen version of the movie.What a joke!,negative
"This fits my 7"" kindle fire hd perfectly! I love it. It even has a slot for a stylus. The kindle is velcroed in so it's nice and secure. Very glad I bought this!",positive
Not the best leather but worked fine and keeps my Kindle safe and protected.  It should have come with a stylus.,positive
"Case fits well on my kindle, serves the purpose and for the price, you can't beat it.Definitely a keeper.",positive
"I got this got a new kindle fire hd owner who LOVES yellow. The case is nice for price, it does what it has to do but the smell at first is very unpleasant. I'm glad it arrived fast and I had time to leave it out of plastic for a few days  to air out till smell went away.",positive
i love this case fits my kindle perfectly the only thing i dont like is that the power button is not visable in the case other than a great case,positive
"It's her favorite color and it protects her kindle. She has no complaints. Covers the power button, but not a big deal.",positive
the only downside to this was the cover covers up the on off button and the camera and I have to take it out of the cover to use the camera if I had known this I would have chosen a different one,positive
"Great case, not sure how the hand stripe works and wish it had vertical stand but for the price it's the best case I ever had. Very soft and smooth on the inside. Color is the best.",positive
"Well it is nice, i just bought the wrong one, any ways it fits my tablet. and I'm still using it.",neutral
I just received this today!!  I love it.  I have one similar for my Kindle Fire HD and I love the sleep and awake feature!!!,positive
"Great case, especially for the price point.  My daughters favorite color so she loves it too.  Bought the matching stylus.",positive
"worked great for what  I needed it for, and was small too",positive
"I bought 4 of these for my test equipment - they got the job done. Though the screw on one of these did snap under medium torque... the other 3 adaptors were fine under the same torque. However, on a different one of these adaptors, I had to &#8220;open up&#8221; one of the pin holes slightly before it would accept my male cable. I would probably buy again.",positive
Very compact and no problems with baud rates up to 115k.  Couldn't be happier with this adapter.  I highly recommend keeping this and the various related adapters to anyone who needs to interface with network equipment.,positive
"This works as a null modem cable, just as advertised.This low profile connector is working perfect in combination with my USB RS-232 cable.",positive
"Nice construction and nice labeling so you don't use it for the wrong thing.  It does the job and for only three bucks, you can't go wrong.",positive
"It is not very often that I can get something cheap, fast, and that performs as it should.  This is one such item.  The hardware seems to be durable, it is very compact, and it performs the simple null modem task.",positive
Bought this to transfer video from some old equipment. (Sony CCD-TRV308 Hi8 videocam and Panasonic Omnivision VHS cassette player.) It's not fancy but does the job. I prefer to use PotPlayer to capture/convert the video over the included software which works ok. I'm satisfied with this purchase.,neutral
"I have been using this alot, converting old video tapes, VHS, and tv into online videos. Anything you can play on your vcr, from tapes or tv, it can record.",positive
The EZGrabber2 works well but it's software is a little lack luster. I have software installed on my computer that works properly with my night vision so the EZgrabber works well to do what I needed.,positive
I bought it to create dvds from home vhs video. Had to upgrade my pc to a faster cpu to avoid jittery recording. After that it work as described. Delivery was fast.,positive
"A little background...I am a 38 year old man who has played around with electronics and computers my entire life. Windows 7-64bit machine with 8GB RAM blah,blah,blah.I have struggled well over a month with this piece of trash. After this experience I'm DONE with Micro$oft's depending on consumers to fix there crap OS and heading to Costco to let other computers do what this device clearly will not.",negative
"At the time I bought this cover the Kindle had just come out.(1st generation) It served its purpose , but since then there have been so many new cover in types and styles.",positive
"I am a gamer and a coder. This monitor is great for both. Although i would like it a bit more with HDMI, it performs beautifully from my GTX 770 4GB DVI-D.",positive
"I ordered this thing and received it,I tried for hours to get it to connect to my home wifi network but to no avail.A couple of months later I bought a smartphone and connected to my wifi network in seconds,dont buy this piece of junk.",negative
"Very fast, dependable OS (way better than the wm5), good buttons, nice scroll device, good battery life, bt and wifi works very well, the only glitch is that it would be nice to have a better screen, other than that is nearly perfect.",positive
It doesn't connect. It reckognizes that there's internet service &#34;somewhere&#34; but after I get to the log-on network screen ...it doesn't connect.,negative
"This is the best thing I have ever bought, get a wireless signal is the easiest, using the device is the best, and overall this is the best thing I have bought....",positive
"I bought this to go with my new Acer Aspire One.  I also wanted an external burner that is lightweight and small.  This one worked immediately right out of the box and is everything it is decribed to be.  Fast service from the seller with several pre-and post-shipping alerts from the seller, too.  A real pleasure.",positive
"Not much to say here. Good value. Works as described. A little bigger than it needs to be, but does the job.",positive
"Tengo una Mini y no tiene unidad de disco, este producto ha sido de muchisima utilidad para la reproducci&oacute;n y grabacion en cds",positive
"I bought this because my COMPAQ DVD drive is not working too well. The External drive installed and seemed to do its stuff without any problems on WIN7. It comes with an extra USB cable to provide extra power to the drive if your primary USB port is not sufficient,On the ACER I use for streaming to my TV, it was just Plug in and use, no further installation was required, also a WIN7 machine.",positive
I have had this for a couple months. Used it to load Win7 on a Acer Netbook. Worked just great.,positive
Dont buy this unit. It is a dvd-rom and i needed a Dvd writer. It does not read Dvds but read Cd. Absolute waste of money.,negative
I have a 10 1/2 in. computer with no disk drive and I needed to get my computer updated as much as possible.  This is working wonders and I am slowly cleaning my computer off of the old stuff and putting on new or updated programs.,positive
I just re-read the details of this product and still can not find any mention of the fact that this device is a READ ONLY device and will not create/burn CDs or DVDs.  I'm very very dis-satisfied with the product and with Amazon for carrying it.,negative
Drive simply will not mount. I imagine this must be fine for the person it works for but I'm returning mine as non-functioning.,negative
"I must add this review since this is a great product at a ridiculously low price.I needed a CD/DVD player to install programs to my new netbook. Installation was easy; just pluged in the two usb cables and it worked immediately.I upload Microsoft Professional Office 2007 quickly and easily.  It does play movies, I played my Harry Potter Movie with no problems. The VLC media player was already installed. I highly recommend this player",positive
This goes great with my ACER netbook.  I use it a lot to import things from other computers.  It makes things so much more convenient.,positive
"Works as advertised. I needed a replacement for the internal drive on my Lenovo Y510 which had failed. Since the failure on the internal drive had happened before, I didn't want to deal with that again. Having an external drive is a little unhandy but once the OS had been loaded on it, an internal drive would be rarely needed.",positive
"I use this thing way more than I thought I ever would. Great little product, can be a pain if your USB ports are to close together.",positive
"I bought the blue one for my son's blue Toshiba netbook, and it matches exactly. It arrived with two cables and instructions, but I only needed the USB cable. I plugged it in, the driver software loaded, and it worked! It's small and quiet, and works perfectly for a great price.",positive
"This external drive has helped me a lot, it comes in handy when your mac, notebook or netbook cd/dvd drive is not working.",positive
"I had a small notebook computer which had no internal DVD/CD drive so I purchased this. I have used it to run and install countless programs and not once has it ever given me trouble. I have also installed and played many games and it has a fast read speed and gets the job done in a timely fashion, I highly recommend.",positive
"I have purchased a small laptop (netbook type) for use as a large tablet.  It has a touch screen and Windows 8 installed.  However, it does not have an optical drive (too small of a footprint).  To load some of my favorite programs requires a CD/DVD drive.  This unit meets that need very nicely.  It is effective, quiet and seems to draw minimum power with just one USB cable.",positive
"I got this to use with a Linux based XBMC media center on a ZBOX as the DVD player. It was recognized out of the box. It plays DVDs great, until it just quits. I'll have to buy another drive as this one is not working for me.",negative
This drive was not recognizable by either a Windows 7 PC or a Windows 8 tablet.  Got similar item ($5 more) from Microcenter and it was plug and play.,negative
"It's okay and easy to use but feels a bit flimsy although I don't use it often, so I'm glad I have it. But haven't had great luck with DVDs and not sure if wrong type disc or what.",neutral
"There are times that a DVD drive is essential, such as installing office, this does the job throught the usb connection.",positive
I bought this external usb for my netbook and it works great for downloading programs. In fact I've been lending out to other family members. No complaints here.,positive
It works fine to play DVDs.  Haven't used it in other applications yet.  As others have said you have to download a media player if you have Windows 8.  I used VLC media free download.,positive
Sometimes cheap is good. You go a long way with your buck. With this machine I ended up spending more money since it malfunctioned ever since the beginning. My computer wouldn't even recognize the damn thing. I had to install a load of drivers and still it malfunctioned. I would recommend getting a pricier apparatus that is guaranteed working from the moment you plug it in.,negative
I like it but it does take a minute to come on and is quite a pain going from one science to another.  Other than that it is okay!,neutral
Pros: Full system in a small case.Cons: having t use 2 usb portsto transfer and power system is a drawback.Overall a good external system,positive
No problems so far except unable to upload a program CD. Not sure if it was the CD/dvd my computer or the software but just that one disc.  That disc works in my desk top but not in this unit.  Not sure why.  All other dvd's and CD's have been working without a problem.,positive
"This USB DVD/CD external drive works like a charm! Very simple to set up, have been using it with my iMac that does not have an internal disk drive. Computer recognized it immediately. The drive is very light and portable.",positive
Basic dvd player for the computer. Plug it in and it works. So far so good.,positive
could not get my Acer netbook to accept this device.returned it .Eventually got a true plug and play LG  one--had much more luck,negative
"I bought this external dvd for my mini dell.It works great but it does NOT play all region dvds.IT ONLY PLAYS REGIONS 1......Kept trying to view some anime & regular cartoons, but no can do.Otherwise it's a ok  drive.",positive
"I use CR123A batteries like candy, I didn't know they were rechargeable till a colleague of mine happened to have a set. I quickly got on amazon and found this kit which has been a life saver. The ability to charge them either from a 120 wall outlet or a 12V car charger is invaluable, particularly if travel between countries..",positive
"Very powerful batteries, use it a lot and doesn't have to care about spare batteries, great price for the package",positive
"These batteries are good and so is the charger. For my husbands police small flashlight, this is great, especially the car charger!",positive
"This is a great kit, everything works as it should. Fast service from the seller. Didn't realize there was a car plug adapter included, this will come in handy.",positive
"I haven't had these long, but they appear to work.  Only time will tell how long they hold a charge and how many times I can recharge them.  Price was good though.",positive
"If you are like us, and you have tactical flashlites and night lights on your firearms, you know it is no fun to pay $10 for 2 to 3 hours of light. These pay for themselves in no time at all.With that said, I will repost if they fail early or quit retaining full charge. So far we have about 15 charges and recharges. We have had them for about 6 months.",positive
Two of the batteries never worked. I contacted them about replacements and they wanted me to jump through so many hoops I just figured it was not worth the effort. Lesson learned.,negative
"The batteries work and the recharger, recharges. You cannot ask for more so this product has my blessing. It was also a great buy and saved me some coin so it REALLY has my blessing!!! Thanks for providing a great product at a great price!!",positive
"I bought some of these to try with a light using 123 A's. They work as advertised. When you check them with a meter they show over 3 volts, but under load they do not hurt the light. Have been using them for a while now. Hold a charge VERY well, and no longer have to buy throw away 123A's.",positive
These batteries work flawlessly. The charger is why I dropped a star. Sometimes it doesn't recognize the batteries.,positive
"I bought these for use in my flashlights, Steripen Adventurer, and MSR MiOx.  The chargers work better than the solar counterparts but any use overseas you better take the solar chargers.  Still, they arrived quickly and have worked well every time.",positive
Run time in my regulated JetBEAM flashlight was about 40% of what it should be with these batteries which were freshly charged. Well under powered and capacity. They're going to be replaced immediately with any battery other than this one. These batteries will see second string duty.,negative
This is exactly what I needed for my SU-800 wireless flash commander. It sure beats buying these batteries as often as I was. I definitely recommend it.,positive
"Got one for home, and one for the car.  Work great, but sometimes don't last as long as the non-rechargeable versions.  Great for training days for my tactical lights, as I can use one up and grab another from the charger.",positive
Imagine that you dont have to worry that you forgot to turn your flash off or it got flipped on in your camera bag. Imagine you never have to worry that your battery will die on you.And it came fast in great packagaing.Thanks.,positive
"The right charge slot works fine, but the left one insists on flashing (indicating bad cell) when ever I use it, even with cells that charge fine in the right slot.  Since I only need to charge one cell at a time, I can live with it, but it's peculiar.",neutral
Charges quickly. very good set for the price. will review more when field tested. using it for my tactical flashlight used for LE work.,positive
"Worked well for my older iPods, but it was purchased to enhance iPhone recording. However, there is no increased quality or functionality with the iPhone over the built in mic.",neutral
"Works as advertised.  A bit large, so interferes with plugging in usb charge cord.  And, of course, with this plugged in it turns off the speakers.",neutral
"This little microphone transforms my iPod into something much more useful for recording events.  There is no way to listen at the same time, but that was advertised as such.  Thank you.",positive
"When I wanted to use my iPod to record some reminders to myself I looked around for a compatible microphone expecting to pay $25 to $50 or more and having a twenty page instruction book to study, but then I found this little gem at a great price and no instruction book to study and it works like a charm for me, just plug it in and go. I wish all tech stuff could be this easy.",positive
Ipod 5G/5.5G DO NOT SUPPORT LIN IN MICROPHONES!!!!!!DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU HAVE A 6g 120GB,negative
I have a ipod touch i bought this item before i realized that my ipod already has a built in mic and so haven't used this mic and never needed it.,neutral
These work for the itouch 64gb but they sometimes skip when recording. You can not hear what you are recording. The sound quality is okay.. I did get this product fast through the mail.,neutral
This products work for what i was using it for (an old iPod touch). I'm pleased but this is VERY easy to lose.,positive
Wouldn't buy this again.  I never really used the product because it didnt fit the phone that well with the phone case on.,negative
"I gave this five stars because for the price, this tiny microphone is excellent.  I needed a small unobtrusive mic to record university lectures to my 3rd Generation iPod Touch.  I can report that this mic works perfectly.If you need fancy cut offs, filters, or you expect concert quality results, please go elsewhere.  If you want something that works well for much less than $10, get this mic or get a couple of them.",positive
"This mic sounds surprisingly great! It picks up a wide range of frequencies very nicely! My only complaint is that it is easy to lose, but there's nothing the manufacturer could do about that.",positive
"Small, compact, easy to carry around.  Followed the instructions and it worked perfectly.  It's not a broadcast quality microphone, but for everyday voice use it's a great, portable solution.",positive
"Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...",negative
"When I bought my Itouch a few years back, I didnt like the fact that it had no mic.  So I started doing some searching here on amazon.com and I found one and still have it today.  i was able to PTT ( PRESS TO TALK) LIKE A WALKIE TALKIE AND OTHER stuff. I like it.",positive
...you must unplug the microphone unit to hear any replay/sounds.  I'll hack it in the future in order to allow sounds while it's plugged in.,positive
Didn't work on my iPhone or iPods. Loved that it is compact. Wasn't out much money luckily. Do not recommend.,negative
This an awesome product.  It was cheap and works well.  I use it to record lectures in college so I can listen to them again.,positive
It works perfect. The only thing is it is so small. lol. like I think I have seriously swallowed medications larger than this device. Good item. Would recomend to anyone.,positive
I love this mic it works on itouch 3generation 8 gb so well. I love it too much and wat a money saver too . Nothing more to say but to order it soon!!!,positive
"This is a very good seller. The product arrived exactly on the estimated date of arrival. The only problem I have is that the mic has no speakers, so you need to unplug it to listen to the ipod again.",positive
useless piece of device for a device that already has a mic... the performance is very average...!!! looks smooth tho.,negative
"It does not work. When you plug it in, it disables the speakers and then the iPod is practically silent. Not a good idea.",negative
I needed this for my iPod Touch and also ordered a few extras because I lose little things easily. This mic has provided much use and definitely of better quality than I was expecting it to be. I've even recommended this to a couple of friends.,positive
"sensitivity is slightly on the low side...records loud static noise every three seconds...otherwise, it's a good product...",positive
"This item works with an I-phone 4, 4s and a Samsung Galaxy S3.  The microphone picks up sound 10 time better than the built in phone mic.  The shipping time was a little long but that is clearly stated when you purchase it.  This lets you use your phone as a digital recorder.  I will buy another one",positive
Good product does the job. Good price. It has a carrying case. I used for the ipod  does a good job.,positive
"I plugged it in and it worked. It is small, but taking it with you is a challenge. How about making it into a key chain?",positive
"this is a fantastic tool if you are recording anything from Business meetings, you can even use it for the app Shazam... it really cool. not for use for the voip though...",positive
"It's simple and works well for me. Sellers say you have to purchase an additional app, but mine works fine with the included 'Memo' app on my iPod Touch 2G. Down side is that you have unplug it to listen to the recording.",positive
I use this product all the time since I am on Voxer.  I needed a microphone and this product is great because it is small and not as noticeable.  I really love it,positive
I don't know what I was thinking buying this piece of junk.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Invest in quality and stay away from this thing.  Seriously.,negative
Nice add on for those who have an iPod Touch.  Not a miracle worker but provides microphone capability.,positive
SD Ultra Micro SDXC card has worked without flaw so far.  It's been trouble-free up to this point in transfering and managing all my audio files (~29GB) from my HP laptop to my Samsung Note 10.1 2014 Edition.  I've also purchased compatible SD micro cards for my Samsung Galaxy III cell phones which have worked out better than the Kingston cards that I had originally purchased.,positive
"i like it, but a little expensive compared to others i saw online after purchasing.  Other than that, it's good.",positive
"I bought this on March 4th, 2014. Suddenly even thought the Storage in settings showed the card with used and free space, no app could find any files on it. Had to dismount, remove it and reinsert it for it to work, BUT it is erratic! While in the middle of playing mp3s on it, all the files disappeared.. This is happening over and over. Very disappointing!",negative
Works as described. Have not had an issue with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. There was a surprise when it arrived though: there was an SD adapter card with it. Did not read that in the description when I ordered the card.,positive
"These are great, the USB port is especially handy. Small size, and all the adapters I could want. At first it seemed to light to do it's job but it is working great. It is the only adapter that I use when travelling.",positive
"This is very handy and it charges two things at once easily. I usually charge my laptop and iPod touch in this at the same time and have not had problems with it so far. It also has all of its individual parts for the various plugs it is capable of fitting in all contained within itself, which is very handy because you don't have to remember where you put the EU plug or the US plug, etc!",positive
"I bought this device so I can use my laptop and charge my phone during travel to other European countries. But few hours after using it, the fuse blew up and the device didn't work after that. Very disapppointed.",negative
"We are heading to Europe this summer.  Of course, we'll have an array of electronic devices with us (camera, kindle, phones, etc.) and I wanted to make sure we could keep things charged as needed during our trip no matter where we ended up.  This is a perfect solution at a very affordable price.",positive
It is good and as expected. I love to have it with me for my international travel.I love it.,positive
"The usb charger socket was totally broken and never worked. I'm not sure what the two red lights were supposed to be for but I never saw either of them turn on either. It was difficult to fit grounded US plugs in without some serious shoving, and the fakey plastic ground doesn't retract so I couldn't use it on outlets that didn't have a ground socket (common in Hong Kong). It's also quite big and heavy to travel with.",negative
"Great product but is not true as they say that it charges ipads, it does not charge them at all, i would rate this a perfect 5 stars if it did, its a pitty.",positive
"There's not much to say, other than that the price was exceptional. The adapter set is compact and appears durable. I really wanted the USB charger plug, and figured I might as well get a complete adapter set into the bargain.",positive
This is a cable.  It allows power to be transfered from and outside source to my Nexus 7.  It functions exactly as advertised.,positive
Described as a better cable than the one that came with the Tablet. Not so! Mini USB doesn't fit and cord is very short. Sending it back ASAP.,negative
not worth your stress...fit loosely from the get go...I have two nexus 7 tablets and it was the same with both. went to wal-mart and bought a cheap generic one and it works great.,negative
"It looks just like the real thing, however it does not hook into the port as well as the original one. Not a big issue considering the price.Google is selling those for way too much, they will not get my money for such overpriced item.",positive
"This cable is fine, except for the fact that there is no rigid construction to keep the male end from bending. I dropped my nexus 7 from a height of 1 foot onto my bed and it bent about 45. Your best bet is the official nexus 7 charger, but beware, the USB and the cable have almost entirely seperated on the cable that came with my Nexus 7.",negative
"A big improvement from the stock cord provided with the device, liked it so much I am going to buy several more,because I take my nexus everywhere",positive
Perfect additional memory for my Samsung Galaxy 4 smart phone.  Easy to install and transfer data.  Could have not asked for anything better.,positive
"I bought 2 of these thinking they were somehow specially formatted for the S4. I suppose I was naive. I could have purchased the same item, for less, with the 'special format.Yes, good product and works fine the phone. Special? No.",neutral
She put it in her Samsung Galaxy 4 phone to be able to hold more pictures and data and hopefully not lose it if she breaks her phone again,positive
"My last memory card for my Galaxy S4 got some water damage on a camping trip a few months ago, which became apparent when all my photos became inaccessible/got deleted. I needed a fairly large and reliable memory card to replace it. I've had this microSD card for a few months now, and it has been great! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable way to store data, especially photos on the Galaxy S4.",positive
"I bought this for my son's GoPro and it's worked out great. I just wish I would have bought the 64gb instead of going cheap on the 32gb, but so far so good. He's a couple of months into using his camera with this card and no issues.",positive
Purchased this after the purchase of a camcorder that required it and would not work with a 16gig. Got the smaller card at local store because of price and wanted to compare Amazon first. Haft the price of buying it local so was worth the wait. Was in my hands a few days after ordering and would recommend that one at least look here before paying the box store price.,positive
This card is very good. I use it in my Gopro because that need a fast writing and reading. I recommend it.,positive
"I needed a class 10 card for my GOPRO and this one looked like the best deal for the size ,and I have always liked the Sandisk brand .",positive
The micro sd card worked with no problem whatsoever. The adapter that came with it did not work at all. Luckily i had an extra.,positive
This card works well with my GoPro. Lots of storage space in a small package. The price was fair for a SanDisk product.,positive
Bought this for my new Gopro and away we go. Great SD card at a great price...love it love it love it.,positive
I liked it. I is already formatted and no need for formatting it. My galaxy s4 recognized it easily and easy to use. The only reason I gave 4 star because it is not 32G as stated and it is only 29g. I don't know if that is supposed to be or not. I am happy anyway and would recommend this sd card to every body . You won't never regret .,positive
Very High Quality and what a deal! Fast shipping. I trippled the memory on my Galaxy S4 for only $22.90  ship. Anyway now i can have all my music and videos and pictures on my new external memory and my phone runs great. I have the Samsung Galaxy Gear watch so I needed more room to install programs for the gear. Awesome deal!,positive
"this is OEM from Kingston.  i've had other data storage items from them.  all good.  this one, too.  have not used the adapter.",positive
"This is a good, inexpensive option for my camera. It works perfectly. Amazon sells it for less. Kingston is a reliable brand.",positive
Slipped right into my Galaxy 4S and was able to transfer all media from my previous card to this one. Allows me to use my phone without worrying about running out of storage.,positive
Fast delivery.  Works as described and does the job. Kingston reputation was final decision maker.  Would buy again.  Using with Samsung Galaxy S4.,positive
We bought two of these micro cards for my wife's new Samsung Galaxy 4 cell phone since she takes a lot of pictures and we wanted a second micro card for backup.  All I can say is that the card works well in the Samsung cell phone.,positive
Fit inthe phone and worked fine.  It is tough to get enthusiastic about memory except as one ages and loses theirs.,positive
Nice pack. Installed easily in my galaxy S4. Works great.. Instead of paying $100 for a 32gb phone get a 16Gb phone and add the SD card...,positive
Digital works or it doesn't (despite Monster Cable's hooey). This works and the price is right.,positive
This cable for under $7 was every bit as good as the ones sold in camera stores for $40+ dollars.  I'm very happy with my purchase.,positive
The cable works as advertised and the price is unbeatable. I am not using it for a camcorder but for a canon elph camera with HDMI out. The photos and videos look great,positive
Bought this hoping it would be as good as the $20 one at Staples. For the price...why not try it? Works great. No graininess. No interruption of transmission. Perfect length for my purposes. They must have just had an abundance and wanted to get rid of them because they are top quality.,positive
I needed an hdmi cable to connect my camcorder to the flat screen tv.  Did not wanted to hassle and see it on rca cables.  Cables work and were cheap.,positive
Prompt shipping. On time delivery. Excellent quality cable. Tested using my Canon SX 40 and it worked really well for images and for video. Good buy and great price.,positive
What pay $50 for a Canon brand cable when you can get this one for under $10 and the quality is just as good. I highly recommend this mini HDMI cable.,positive
this cable lets me show pictures and videos from my camera through my TV monitor.  Easy to use.  Clean picture.  It does what it's supposed to do.,positive
We use this cable to hook our camera to the RV TV.  Works well and is long enough to be able to see at a table and operate the device.  The photos look nice on a large screen.,positive
"Can view my pictures right from my Cannon 4Ti on my big screen TV with this.  It works great, but be sure to follow Cannon's directions.  You must have the cable connected and have the TV on before turning on the camera.  It is great to look at the pictures on the big screen before downloading them so you can pick the good pictures.",positive
"And I like the length....makes it much easier to make the connection between the cfamera and the TV.  My TV is mounted high on the wall, so length is essential if the camera is not to be dangling.  I haven't yet used the cable, but it appears to be strong and flexible.",positive
This HDMI cable is perfect for sending image and video from my digital camera to my HDTV. Being told that it isn't necessary to spend outrageous money on HDMI cable has proven true. I now have several inexpensive HDMI cables that work perfectly. I would purchase additional cables from this seller in the future.,positive
Works flawlessly to connect my new Canon camera to all the HD TVs that I have hooked it to.  Great pics and vids and sound.,positive
Works just like my shorter cables only with more optional length.  A good price for adding distance flexibility for camera to TV hookup when viewing pictures.,positive
I bought this to use with my Canon G10 camera. The Canon version costs about $40. This one works perfectly. No reason to pay a penny more.,positive
"The cable is doing just what it is suppose to do. The connectors fit snuggly into the HDMI input on the TV and the output of my Canon 5D, Mark II. Saved a lot of money vs. the cable offered by Canon.",positive
Just what I wanted to review photos on my camera via my HD TV.  I can sit across the room from the TV and get an excellent view.,positive
"Works great to connect my Canon 60d or t5i camera to an HD TV. I directly connected it to two of my TV's and it works perfectly. When I connected it to a 3 port HDMI switch, it did not work. The price is great.",neutral
this cable does work with my 5D Mark iii and my canon point and shoot...Audio seems a little off ... not sure if it is the cable or not... I mean it does not sound as crisp as listen direct from card and from computer...  No more thought is given to that...,positive
"I found a tiny HDMI jack on my the Canon SX20-IS powershot and found no one had one in-stock locally and special order- I needed to take out a loan. This cable worked perfectly, no issues. Now my still camera can output full HD video/audio. Signal delivered without errors to monitor. 10 feet is a good length for getting around to the back of monitors or wall mounts.",positive
the cable itself is very flimsy compared to the OEM Canon.  Seems to work ok so represents exceptional value for money.,positive
Very good and normal quality. You can use it instead of originals. cheap. suitable for Canon SX40HS. I haven't more words but the site required more words so I wrote that ;),positive
"Simple accessory. Made well, good price, and the length is enough to give you access to a system from a table and run it across the floor.Clean audio and video. Good purchase.",positive
"This was an error,however I shall keep it for a possible use,I find that the layman's description of the plug ids are lacking",neutral
"Very good, working just as I wanted, plugged to my T2i, this is just what I was looking for.",positive
Plug n play...resolution was awesome. Cord was nice quality did not feel like it was cheap. Now i can take the camera AND CABLE anywhere and plug it in.,positive
Premium Canon Mini HDMI Cable is a great fits for my Canon Camera.  It is good low prices for a long 10ft cable.  I recommend it.,positive
"its awsoooooooooome , i connect it with samsung LED and the picture is craaaaazy `mashallah` , i`m very happy becouse this produce",positive
"Just forgo the aftermarket cables for this. The form and fit are hit-and-miss, but the Canon cable is both durable and made so that using it doesn't block off any other ports.",positive
Glad this is available and at a decent price.  So many cables are overpriced just because the seller can get more for it.,positive
I bought this so I can show video clips taken with my Canon EOS Digital SLR on my flat screen TV.  Works great.,positive
THIS CABLE HAS GOOD CONSTRUCTION AND WORKS WELL WITH MY CANON 7D TO WATCH MOVIES FROM THE CF CARD ON THE CAMERA TO THE PANASONIC PLASMA HDTV.A GREAT PRICE FOR QUALITY AND THIS PARTICULAR KIND OF CABLE.,positive
I have a Canon Power Shot SX20IS. The mini plug of this cable fits the receptacle of the SX20IS perfectly. Great buy at a great price!,positive
Premium Canon Mini HDMI cable is a very good product for the price. So far it is working very well for me,positive
"This is a nice cable for a good price.  It works well with my Canon 300hs point and shoot camera, fits well and delivers a good picture.  Sent to me in nice packaging on time.",positive
"Given the rip-off prices of HDMI cables these days, what a pleasant surprise to buy this very functional, fully operational cable for such a great price.  It works.  It's long.  Perfect.",positive
"Great producct, great price, and very happy with it!  We used it with my wifes Canon T3i and it was nice to see the pics on our 55&#34; LCD.",positive
This cable is 10 feet long and at that length I doubt you'd need anything longer.It connects to my TV well and the audio and video comes through perfectly.5-Stars!,positive
This HDMI Cable works just fine.  The price is so much lower than local retail stores.  I recommend the site.,positive
Cable works looks just as any one you would find in retail store for 10 times the price don't hesitate to buy.,positive
"It is not thin and light.  You can put it in your camera bag, so it is very portable.The pictures from my camera look awesome on my big tv.I am hesitant to give it 5 stars, because the first time I tried using it, it did not work.I had to pull it in and out of the camera a few time for it to actually work.",positive
"This cable works well with my T3i, this best thing is that it is 10ft. long so you don't have to be right next to your tv to review your photos and video....",positive
"Very easy for my father to use on his tablet. Literally, plug it in to an HDTV and it shows the image on both the tablet and the TV. As simple as that. No need to mess with any settings",positive
Cost under $4.00 shipped and works just as good as HDMI 6'length I paid $25.00 at Best Buy.No complaints here. Now I have a 10' so I can connect to the TV and still reach my lazyboy.,positive
What can you say about a cheap cable? It works well and doesn't break the bank. Comes with end protectors. I did not have any problems with using this to display the HD output from my camera to a large screen.,positive
Works great.  I lost the original and this one is perfect for my needs. Without it my camera is useless.,positive
"These cables are good. Not top of the line. However, they do get the job done and seem to work well with my DSLR.",positive
"I ordered this cable to use with my Ainol NOVO7 Elf II.  The cable was 10' as described and produces a flicker free, clear 1080p image.  Mine has rounded edges where the connectors meet the cable.",positive
"No problems running from computer to monitor, great value compared to other options and seems to be holding up just fine.",positive
Cable is great...allows me to bridge TV to PC and watch the pictures taken in travel...this past year... for a low price,positive
Very stable for tablet to TV....love it. Pricing is best out there. Ordering 2 more. Absolutely love this for the price and function.,positive
"Ordered this little package for some real connecting,came fast enough for me to say.Hav'nt got the rest of my order to perform my hook-up yet,so being fast did'nt work for me this time(LOL)  THANKS FOR THE FAST SERVICE..........",positive
"Nice, economic hdmi cable. I got it for my mom to use with her new tablet. So she can connect it to the tv if she ever wants. It works just great. Nice and long cable. I was surprised how thin the cable was, but everything works fine with connecting her asus transformer to her led and lcd tvs.",positive
"This cable is pretty long at 10feet. There are gold plated connectors on either end. I'm able to control my camera with the TV remote via HDMI. So, why spend more money than you have to?",positive
"Worked great, no issues. I didn't realize it was 10' wanted a 6' but that was my fault.Cant beat the price",positive
"The cable works as it is described, it is thinner then some other brand cables like Belkin etc. Can't beat the price.",positive
"Although the name of the item is ""Premium Canon Mini HDMI cable (10 ft)"" it's definitely not from Canon. For the price I had my doubts that it ever was, but it does work and still looks to be a quality cable. Only 3 stars as the description is misleading.",neutral
I bought this for my tablet that has a mini hdmi port it works's excellent with my tablet the lengthily cable helps so that you can still control your tablet and this would be good for any other mini hdmi application you desire i definitely would recommend this product,positive
I already used this on my recorder. I got this at the right price. Everything here is reasonable and a person can't go wrong.,positive
Arrived on time and as described.  Plugged directly from my Canon DSLR to my TV.  Pictures were clear and bright.  Great price when I combined this purchase with other cables I needed.,positive
"If you have a Canon camera with a port suitable for connecting to this cable... but this NOW.  For just a few dollars, you can enjoy HD pictures and video on your HD television.  Cable is nice and long for easy use with the TV.  I would recommend to anyone.",positive
"This 10' cable works great with my Canon T2i and my LCD TV.  Leaves plenty of room to reach the input on the TV and step back to enjoy the pictures.  Picture quality on my 46"" tv is amazing compared to the RCA video cord that is included with the camera.",positive
"Wonderful deal on a good length cable with no adapters required. I use this frequently for previewing on large screens, works like a charm.",positive
I used this to connect an older NVidia GTX460 video card in a PC with a low clearance backplate mini-HDMI port to me AV receiver on a home theater system. Cable worked perfectly with no issues!,positive
"The cable arrived quickly, and is well made with Gold Connectors .  This conversion of one smaller than the other also will fit most digital devices (ie) Android Tablets, Digital Cameras, Cellphones etc",positive
It seems to work ok to connect my TV with a Canon DSLR. . . . . . . .,positive
"this cable made it possible to connect my tablet to my big flat screen, so i could see videos better",positive
"Perfect length! Sturdy, and works as good as any other major brands out there. It's the best bang for the buck!",positive
Does what it supposed to and so far no problems. Length is good too as I don't have to be right in front of the TV.,positive
"All the new graphics card seem to be going to mini-HDMI or DisplayPort, I hooked this up from my PC to my 42 inch LCD HDTV and it works great, the display is fabulous! Playing games like Starcraft 2 is just awesome.",positive
"NOTE: This is an adapter to go from full size hdmi to mini hdmi, this is for digital cameras and other equipment with mini HDMI. This is not for cell phones and tablets that have Micro HDMI adapters like the HTC Evo, Motorolla Droid, Nexus 10, etc.Not much to say here, it works just as I expect it to work on any digital camera I've used. Plug it in and you're ready to view files on the big screen!",positive
Works fine when I use it to connect my android tablet to TV. Only used it 6or7 times but happy for now.,positive
"Canon wanted $70 for a similar cable, but I bought this cable for my Canon Rebel T1 digital SLR at this remarkable price.  The cable is spectacular and my images and videos are very clear.  The standard analog cable that was included with the Rebel is disappointing and there is a night and day difference between a digital signal and an analog signal.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.",positive
"I bought this for my 7D, it good, material seems ok, bit cheap, but it works. But I think it is still a bit expensive compared to same cables from MonoPrice.The thing is that I discovered that having a converter from mini and regular HDMI and a cable works better for me.",positive
"Tested this out to connect a MK808 Android stick to my Panasonic plasma TV.  Works fine, no problems I could tell.",positive
"plugged in my tablet - works fine.I haven't tested it on my DSLRs, but I'm sure those work fine too.",positive
"This HDMI cable got shipped the same day I ordered it. I was thinking it would work from my Canon SLR to my laptop to view photos after I shoot them, but it doesn't. I have a small lcd screen I use, and it works perfect...",positive
I bought this for the convenience of hooking up the HDMI port on my Canon camera to my HDMI tv. The length is just enough to sit back and scroll through your pictures (back and forth) at your own speed. Plugging the memory stick into the tv works as well; but you're stuck using the TV's slide show or other program to view.,positive
THIS MINI HDMI CABLE  WORKS GREAT WHEN CONNECTING IT TO MY DIGITAL CAMERA. I COULD VIEW MY PHOTOS IN HD WITH MY LARGE SCREEN HDTV.,positive
I got this to connect my Canon 7D to the TV. I like the low price and the quality of picture i get on TV but the cable is a bit hard to windup for storing in the bag. I wish the rubber compound used to make the cable is a bit softer to handle.,positive
"This cable has simple small ends, not overly flexible or stiff.  Great value for the dollar.You can purchase with confidence.",positive
Perfect. Does what it says. Very reasonably priced. I use this cable for my Canon 5D mkII with various monitors and televisions.,positive
What can I say - it works at a fraction of the price Canon wants.  I would buy again.  Prompt delivery. Useful product to review photos on HDTV.,positive
"I needed a Mini-HDMI to HDMI cable to hook up my computer to my TV.  This is exactly what I needed.It works without any problems, and I've had it for awhile; and moved my PC / TV many times.  Good durability.",positive
"it works great, for a canon mini type slr, detected the camera and samsung tv with no problems, great price.",positive
Needed it so I can watch my recordings on the big screen instead of having to transfer the files on my computer all the time. Basically just got it to share fast and it does the job.,positive
"...at the price i paid for this.  using two--one as a camera-to-computer and the other as a monitor-to-computer cord, and have had zero problems with either of them to date.",positive
I needed this cable to connect my Epson project to my laptop. Works great and the price made it a no brainer purchase.,positive
...you can buy this 10foot cable for such a great price? The length is great.  It allows you to sit on the couch or recliner and view your photos and videos in comfort.  I recommend this cable.,positive
"Got this to connect my 550 ti to my tv, and it works perfectly. Audio and Video are both delivered fine. It's good length, too. Not sure what else you could want from a cable. I suppose it's a little loose in the 550, but I'm not sure if that's the cable or the graphics card itself.Anyhow, let me know if you have any questions, I'll try to answer them!",positive
"This cable works well for connecting our camcorder directly to the TV.  It's long enough to allow me to sit a comfortable distance from the TV while using the controls on my camcorder.  The connectors on the ends are not bulky, and the cable is not unnecessarily stiff.  I can coil it up small enough to tuck into the camera bag while we're on the go.  We'll see how long it lasts, but it's working great for now.",positive
A cable runs lifetime. Excellent product that is no longer wearing and giving good care never going to hurt you. Product 100 percent recommended,positive
Quality of connection and video seems good with my Fujifilm F550EXR camera connected to my HDTV. 10 foot of cable really helps so I can sit comfortably in front of the TV at a little distance and manipulate the camera.,positive
"What is there to say?  I needed a cable to run from the camera to my TV and this is what was needed.  It works as expected, and allows me to view my videos and pictures that are on my camera directly on my television.",positive
I can find nothing wrong with this cable.  It works perfectly and has a great price.  I do not understand why the HDMI cables are so expensive at the brick and mortar stores.,positive
"Works perfectly at 1080p HD and in all other Canon EOS 7d modes. Costs less than 1/4 the price of the Canon equivalent. Expensive ""high end"" cables are a scam. It would be crazy to pay more. Tip: If you have never tried displaying your HD video or stills on an HD TV through an HDMI input, you will be shocked by the magnificent quality. Absolutely no comparison to the lousy pictures you got with the old analog inputs.",positive
"I was looking for a light weight cable to go from a small video camera to a hdmi video capture card in the computer. Used two of these cables on two jvc camcorders, and they did not transmit a usable signal to a video card in the computer.  Changed to a heaver-weight cable that worked fine.  I plan to try it with a canon camcorder, but I suspect it will work no better. I'll probably end up returning them.",negative
"Bought this to hook up my Motorola Photon 4G to my 60 inch TV. worked like a charm. you cant beat the price too. all in all, its a good product to have if your internet is down and you want to stream HDMI from your phone/device to your TV like Netflix etc.",positive
"On many cars the electric outlets turn off after a period of time when the car is turned off. So, if you want to charge from an electric outlet you need this charger. Works well and fast.",positive
I like to know that when I need a device I can use it when I feel like so the need to have it ready and going made me get this at home charger for my Garmin. Now I can go and around on foot and know that where there is an outlet I can charge up again and go. SLM,positive
"This appears to be a generic charger, not specifically designed for the Garmin Nuvi 1450 GPS, at least I could find no data with the charger that tied it to this GPS.  I decided no to use the charger on my GPS for fear I may damage it.  To return it would cost more in shipping than the charger is worth.",negative
"This product is of sturdy construction. Works well with the Garmin, and you can't beat the low price of this vender.",positive
"He used it a few weeks and it didn't work after that. He had to return it and they sent him another one. As far as I know, this one is working fine. I know initially he enjoyed using it.",positive
"I use a car charger more than i use the wall charger, but the wall charger comes in handy at the house",positive
I bought this AC charger for my GPS so that I could charge it in the house when I get home from a trip instead of leaving it in the car to charge.  I would recomend this to anyone.,positive
"What can I say....it does the job with no problems.  Actually, since I use my Garmin a lot in my car, it keeps a charge without having to charge it at home.",positive
"This is not a Garmin charger ,it is a MOT-V3CE .It works ,but it not as advertised .This also doesnt matter but the light is Green not Red also as advertised",negative
I didn't expect this camera to  be as good as it is. Takes good pictures and videos. But I am glad that I didn't buy from Kodac: their price is pricey. I gave less than $100 and consider this money well spent.I would recommend this camera.,positive
"Well it seemed to be working fine for about six hours, then it began discharging my GPS completely.  Had to charge it several hours in car to get it working again.",negative
Just recieved my charger works fine ! did not understand all the negative reviews. can't beat the price. shipped on time. like HDE,positive
"First of all, this product charges my Garmin 1450 very slowly. I had it plugged in using this device for 3 hours and it still was not fully charged. You may as well use the blackberry cell cord to charge; it also takes this long to charge the device. The car charger will charge the 1450 fully in about 1 hour. Waste of my money.",negative
these were a great addition to my gps but i wish i didn't have to buy everything seperatly but this is necessary to the gps,positive
I bought the wall charger because I bring my Garmin into the house each night.  I thought it would be easier to have it charge at night for use the following day. Now I don't need to use the car charger unless the battery gets low during extended use.,positive
Works as escribed. Shiiping container damaged but no harm to the charger. I use it to charge my Garminwhen I use it at home.,positive
This product was ultra cheap at $3.18 however it didn't work. Apparently it is possible to spend too little. You get what you pay for! For $8.50 I purchased a plug adapter and lighter adapter that works by allowing a standard USB cord to be plugged into either. The alternate vendor's product worked well.,negative
"BOTTOM LINE>DOESN'T WORK AT ALL&lt;>DOES NOT CHARGE NUVI 1450&lt;SELLER TOOK MY MONEY, CAUSE NOT WORTH RETURNING. Plug it in, turns on, turns off, no charge. Can't even work on it while plugged in.",negative
"I don't use this very much, but when my Nuvi has sat in my car for a few months, I'll pull this baby out and let it charge overnight when I'm about to take a trip.  Works well with no problems so far.  A good buy!",positive
"does exactly as it is supposed to do, it charges the gps. best to leave it plugged in over night as it takes a while to do the full charge",positive
"It is designed to charge your GPS, and protect the GPS' battery. OF COURSE IT TAKES LONGER! Works fine. I love it. 'nuf said.",positive
Excellent. this product is lovely and is very good for use in my new iPhones and others thing to me,positive
"At a much lower cost than many cost this does the job very well if you want to do extended work with your Garmin GPS away from a car, like when I was adding all my addresses to it.",positive
It has worked well with no problems. That is the short and sweet. This sentence is added  to satisfy the word count.,positive
This unit works as advertised.  Not the best charger I have ever used but not the worst.  It allows me to keep my Garmin topped off with power prior to embarking on a trip.  (Could be real useful if you use your GPS city feature to explore an urban landscape by foot.)  All in all this unit has performed to expectations and is small enough to store with my other GPS accessories.,neutral
The charger that came with my Garmin was no longer functioning so I was pleased to find this item.  It is worth buying.  It was packaged securely and arrived very quickly.,positive
"Garmin Nuvi 800 series Standard Red LED Wall / AC / Home Charger is a time and Battery Saver, also, the price was right.I needed it for a phone and GPS battery charger.So far it's a work horse and worth the money, if you needed it of coarse.",positive
It worked perfectly. Nothing more that I could ask from a home charger. If you need one it will do the job.,positive
"It's a wall wart.  It's black.  It works.  It looks just like the ones for my pocket camera, iPod amp, cell phone... I'm going to have to start labeling these things.",positive
I used it once. Worked jus' real good.Can't find it now - it's probably with the 87 other AC adaptors I have because the idiots in the electronics industries can't agree on one or two standard charger voltages and connector shapes... grrrr....,positive
It's difficult to write a specific review for this product.  It either works or it don't.  It works.  That's what I want it to do.,positive
Very happy with it I bought this for my Garmin GPS it does what it should without any problems great price to,positive
"Installed into my Garmin 1450 and was able to download entire map of North America. Good price, quick delivery and happy customer.",positive
I uploaded All of United States and Canada via Garmin and have all the space I need for my GPS.,positive
I needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. This one did the trick.,positive
This is the card that is needed to fit the rest of the maps and traffic updates onto the Garmin nuvi 1450. Works great.,positive
Works fine in my Garmin and for a 4GB card the price is right.  I would recommend it to a friend.,positive
"Very pleased with my purchase. I needed a AD card for my GPS to download updates, maps, and fun vehicles. This works great. No problems.",positive
I needed this card to update my maps in my Garmin because there was not enough room on the Garmin to fit all the new maps.  This card worked fine.,positive
"Now I can install the full maps on the micro SD card (4 GB), and have the full 1.8 GB available on the GPS for vehicle, voices and other extras.Awesome memory. Highly recommended",positive
The sd card is fine. But it doesn't work with the Garmin Nuvi 1450 LMT. I specifically ordered this for my GPS. But it doesn't seem to be compatible with it.,negative
"Got this for my Garmin nuvi. I understand the original use of card was for portable devices. Nevertheless, it is too small and easy to lose. Now I have to lug around this slightly larger SD card to adapt it to my PC. I'll probably lose it before the next time I try to update the software on the really tiny card. Clunky design overall.",neutral
"I bought this for my Garmin Nuvi (can't remember the model number) with lifetime map updates, a 5 inch screen, and live traffic updates.  It works great to update the US & Canada Maps because you need about 1.6GB to update those!",positive
I was having problems with my Garmin nuvi 1450.  I could not download map updates. This 4gb card solved the problem perfectly.It was easy to install and now I have updated my maps.,positive
When I began updating the maps I was confronted with &#34;no memory&#34;. I didn't realize my Garmin had a place for a SD card! duh&#8230;I ordered this one because Kingston is a quality company and the price was right. Perfect. I'm all caught up on my GPS updates and assume this 4GB card will last the life of the GPS and not fill up.,positive
"I was not happy that I needed a micro card for my nuvi - I get lifetime maps but nowhere to put them, lol. and the card available through garmin cost three times the price of this one!! I was happy to find this at such a great price. It arrived quickly and works great. Thanks for saving my nuvi Kingston!! :)",positive
I`m a musician and I record almost everyday . These tapes is an excelent way to check my self. Very clean recordings and excelent playback.Good tapes,positive
For some reason couldn't find high bias cassette tapes around town. Amazon to the rescue. No problems or complaints with this product.,positive
"THIS PRODUCT IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE AT J AND R.  YOU ENTER  YOUR INFORMATION AND THEN GET TO THE PLACE WHERE IT SAYS: ""PLACE YOUR ORDER"" AND THE CART GOES TO ""0"".  REAL DRAG.  i CALLED JANDR TWICE ABOUT REMOVING THIS PAGE FROM AMAZON BUT THEY SAID IT TAKES TIME.",negative
"I use this in my car to play mp3's of Rock, D+B, Electronic and some Metal and it all sounds good. Convenient feature allows the cord to come out of either of 4 spots on the cassette so it can fit in any car and lets you control where the cord goes. No problems yet, it does as advertised and as always Amazon rocks with fulfillment.",positive
"The cassette, as other have said, makes a clicking noise as it runs.  I have it in a 2001 Rav4 OEM stereo.  It will also cut out when tracks change on the music player.  Very annoying.  I would not have bought this except for the Maxell name.  Disappointed.",negative
Use this to play my ipod in my nissan maxima tape player. Works great and the audio is pretty good. Better then radio quality but not cd quality.,positive
It works fine and is a pretty good product.  I picked this one over 4 other ones because it was cheaper and had okay reviews.  It does the job well.,positive
I got this several years ago so my daughter could listen to her iPod through the family car radio which does not have an AUX input.It does not provide super fidelity but such a device can't ever be compared to a direct connection.It works good (certainly met my expectation) and it still gets used occasionally to play mp3s from my phone.,positive
My other adapter was taken from my car so I needed a replacement. I am satisfied with this one. It does the job well! I'm glad I bought it. :),positive
This works perfect for hooking up my phone to my old tape player in the car. The cord is probably 4 feet so plenty of room to move and it seems to be quality. Mine does make a slight clicking sound when playing but this could be caused by the car tape player and not he adapter.,positive
"This works great and saved me $$$$ that a newer vehicle would have cost.  Plug it in and listen to whatever you've got on your phone or access stations through your phone.  It's fun to listen to foreign stations, etc.",positive
"I ordered this after much searching.  I ordered this one to go in my Toyota Sienna 2001 which has a cassette deck. I chose this brand because I trust it more than the cheaper ones.  It plays good through my car stereo.  The sound is good enough, not as  great as when you have earphones on, but nothing will sound that good when you are in a car anyway. So far I am satisfied with it.",positive
Works fine. The only Caveat is that you may need to manually switch the end where the cable comes out to match the  direction of your cassette player.  When used as configured my player rejected it until I changed the end the cable came out.  I would have preferred a product that did not require configuration.,positive
"Has a little hum, but the highs are crystal clear. Sounds as good as cd.",positive
I use this in my older model truck to listen to my ipod. I have used different FM transmitters in the past and was never really happy with the sound quality. This is the way to go. I wish I had tried it before!,positive
"I was force to buy this since the one that came with my Sony portable CD player and my cassette player in my car didn't get along! I had one of these for years but time got the best of it. SO if I have to get another one, this was my only choice since it works without ANY drama!",positive
arrived on time.  Was brand new as described. I like this product because it brings out a little more bass in the sound.  This is actually the first stereo cassette adapter I've seen that has an extra bass feature.  I recommend it very highly...,positive
We got this player because another brand would not work in my husband's Taurus. It kept giving us an error message and he could not use it with his Ipod. This one does not have the same problems. It works every time. We are very happy.,positive
LOVE these adaptors ! i got this one  mainly for my car... since it  has a  combo cd/cassette deck(which is awesome)this little  gem  does the trick...i use this to play  my mp3 players (sony and an ipod )  the audio quality is superb.. its  crystal clear..  i  also use this in the house on my stereo system...this is a great buy! and its worth it  to have a few of these on hand...you never know when youll need one.,positive
"Works well, purchased as a replacement for another that just wore out over time. Sound quality is very good with no sounds or squeaks from the cassette player.",positive
"I was really surprised at how good the sound quality is with this unit.  My old adapter distorted if turned up to loud at the source, but not this one.",positive
"After ordering and returning the Coby brand version, which did not work at all, I am pleased to report this one works fine.  I bought it to play tunes from my Sandisk mp3 player on my car cassette deck, and this unit fits the bill nicely!",positive
This works great. It shouldn't be that difficult and it isn't. We used it to connect an iPod to my wife's car stereo. The sound is just fine--much better than an FM transmitter we used in the past.,positive
It works. It wasn't expensive. What more can you ask for?  Only use it for the car. And so for 15 bucks it represents the cheapest way to wire my pod.,positive
"This makes it easy to clean your cd player. It tells you what to do when you play it and is not liquid based. Good cleaner and for dirtier lenses, make sure you use a few times to get it good. Always good to have one of these around.",positive
This arrived in only two days so I popped it in on the way to pick up the kiddos. This directions are on the disc and really simple. The cd makes an annoying beeping sounds while cleaning ( I turned the radio down and kept checking for it to finish) but that is my only dislike. The packaging was very study.  I will definitely buy from this seller again.,positive
Did not resolve the issue with my car dvd drive.  When I put it in the drive ejected it as it did with dvds.I beleive it is ok. Just haven't tried it in any other dvd drives I have.,positive
I don't know why I purchased it. I don't even understand how its supposed to work anyway. Mawell makes cheap products anyway. Pretty sure you can find it in the dollar store.,negative
"The product is not recommended for note book optical drives, but I used it anyways and it seemed to work.",neutral
"It worked great for me, but look out the handle on it may break off as it did me. I found out that you really don't need it. The reason I gave it 5 stars is the fact it really works.",positive
"I tried to use it in my 2008 Ford Explorer factory CD changer.  No luck.  It would just spit it out when it got to the brush section.I know some others had said it worked for them in their car decks and changers, but sadly, it did not work for me.If anyone has any ideas or tips that might help it work, I'm all ears.",neutral
"I just needed something, Any brand would have done. Worked great, helped alot and was pretty cheap. (under $10)No Cons.",positive
Just as described.,positive
"Received the shipment on-time, but the first thing I noticed when opening the box were the words ""not for laptop use"" written on the package.  There was no mention anywhere in the specs or description of this item on the site that said it was only for laptops, so since I only have a laptop, I have now needlessly purchased a product I cannot use.",negative
This is one of the best Dvd cleaners . I use it to clean my Sony Dvd burner head once a week.,positive
"Did the job I needed to clean all discs components, very handy and use ful to have, for all cleaning",neutral
"I have not use it yet, so I can not write a review for this item at this point, but I will as soon as I use it.",positive
"Easy to use and cleans a CD or DVD completely. Try it and you will think it is good also. Great price, much better than buying locally.;",positive
"I was having problems burning DVDs in my Macbook Pro SuperDrive.  Bought this and didn't realize it said ""not for use in laptops"" until after inserting disk and it getting ejected without being recognized by the drive.BUT...it worked!  Tried burning a DVD afterwards and it worked.  I guess it spinning in the drive trying to be recognized did the trick.How 'bout that...",positive
"Started having issues with my in-dash CD player after 12yrs. Kept getting read errors.Cleaned the reader and not having any additional issues. Nothing more than a little dust.Also cleaned the 6 CD system, thought it was having overheating issues.since it is still cold weather, may still have the issue, however no new problems after using the cleaning disk.",positive
I was ready to purchase a new CD Player because the one I had wouldn't recognize any CD/DVD's.  I read quite a few ofthe reviews and based on price and reviews I decided on this one.  I installed this cleaner into the player and followedthe instructions and in less than a minute everything was working like new.  Great product.,positive
got this to clean a dvd drive and it wokred as intended . its good and useful good buy recommened,positive
"I used this product on a Philips DVD Recorder. Horrible Mistake!!! It must have screwed up the lens alignment because all discs that are now inserted into the drive come back with the message ""NO DISC"" and no playing or recording can be done. It ruined my machine!",negative
"I bought this CD lens cleaner a while ago for use with my computer. It seems to work fine, and I have had no problems with it!",positive
"Had trouble with recorder playing and then recording, used this cleaner and now works like new. Will use on a regular basis from now on.",positive
How can you tell that these things are actually cleaning your DVD player?  I haven't had any problems but I'm just curious if it's actually cleaning...,neutral
"Easy to use, cleaned the CD player - but the CDs still skip.Ordering a CD cleaner next. Sigh...the CD's are borrowed from the libary -so maybe they are in really bad shape?  Worked for most I guess...",negative
"this product was wonderful,i have cd player in my basement which quit playing cd and i used it once and thsat is all it took the lens was clean and have not had any troubles since",positive
Totally disappointed with this product. Purchased it after reading several positive ratings on Amazon but the disc did not work in my car. The car CD player kept on displaying werror while reading this disc.,negative
"I tried this with a CD-ROM player that was not recognizing the CD. Initially it seemed to help a little bit. But the problem returned quite soon. So I tried using the cleaner again, I think three times in a row. The problem really never went away.",negative
"It really worked for me I noticed a difference after the first application but I actually had to run it maybe 5 times total but now no more skips! Might depend on just how dirty your lens is. Another plus is the equipment test it can also run on your system, found out my system was out of phase and I didn't know it. Just a fantastic product get it!!Tom",positive
Good  headphones.  I like (very much) that they only have a wire on one side  and they are lightweight..The sound is pretty good. I enjoy using them.,positive
"My job involves wearing earphones ALL THE TIME.  so if they are tight, my ears get sore and especially where my eyeglasses go behind my ears.  These are perfect with really good sound.",positive
"These headphones are perfect for the walking iPod/iPhone listener. No buds in ear, no strand ear canal. I use other headphones but these are good, like the fold in ear pads. Cord could be about 6&#34; longer, but still okay.",positive
"Another good buy.  Again, very affordable, and they work.  Far less expensive than buying them in a drugstore.  I like the single wire, it seems to be much easier to manage than two of them..",positive
This is a great set of headphones cheap only in price.Fidelity is fine.Design and light weight are impressive.,positive
"I have several pairs of another brand for my classroom and they're pretty good. I bought this one to compare and it just feels a little cheap. Considering that I buy a pair every month or so, I'll try some other brands.",positive
really nice headset--especially for the price--i use it for my radio while i am walking--no more ear buds for me,positive
"Not even me but also my friends used it for our car cassette players. Worked well, no bad comments. I am happy.",positive
"This product arrived from High N Low Trading with a cracked cleaning fluid container, and all the fluid long gone and dried up.  It was functionally worthless, and not worth the cost to ship it back for a refund.  I might consider buying one again, but not from High N Low Trading.",negative
"I use tapes over and over. Maxell has been the best so far, use to use TDK but they failed way to soon. I have a Maxell standard I've used 25 times. I tape a lot of stuff Maxell high grade is superior to thier Maxell standard,  for movies you want to save, Maxell high grade will do the job.",positive
Maxell has always been a good brand of vhs tape and this did not disappoint me. I like it alot.,positive
i use this brand because they last me for years. i use them weekly and they have good video and audio qualities.,positive
"VHS tapes are becoming harder to come by. I normally buy Sony blank VHS tapes, but Maxell had the better deal and work just as well. I have used their products before.",positive
"After I initially had some problems, the seller sent me a replacement tape free of charge via Priority Mail.  (Initial delivery was also more rapid than expected.)  The problems now appear to have been because of some programming inconsistency with one of my VCR recorders. Both tapes are now serving well.",positive
"We were getting very grained tapes that we could not play back very well. After cleaning the heads with this wet cleaner, we now get a very clear play back picture. Good product.",positive
"Works great!  If you still have the old VCR, this product will do a good job of cleaning it.  It is simple to use.",positive
Worked as described. Cleaned the heads on my vcr/dvd player and the picture quality was better. Very easy to use.,positive
This cleaner works very well and is so easy to use. I will order more when this one runs out!,positive
"I bought this to clean the VCR player component on a combo machine when we noticed the picture from the VCR was pretty shaky. Despite using the dry head cleaner that was on hand, we noticed no improvement. Apparently this wet cleaner was exactly what was needed. The picture shaking disappeared and did not return.Consider this a remedy for treating a dinosaur in the tech world. Glad this was still available.",positive
This is a good wet cleaner. Works great and cleans the tape head so you no longer see static. Simple to use and can be used many times.,positive
"I have used this product many times before, so knew just what I was getting.  It does a very good job of cleaning the track system of your VCR.  You will notice a big difference in the clarification of your tapes once you have used this product.",positive
"Believe it or not, some of us still use VHSOnly because we are digitizing them now. Converting an analog tape to digital media takes its toll on a VCR and the heads get dirty beyond recognition. Eventually I'll have to tear down my deck to clean it properly but for now this cleaning tape really helps",neutral
"I tried to play some tapes I'd had stored for a long while, they were defective from age and humidity and made my VCR dirty and unusable.  This headcleaner took a few uses to clean the heads, but it got the gunk off and now the VCR works as well as when it was new.",positive
"These products are hard to find anymore. While it does appear that this product does clean the heads, the one thing it does not appear to do, is rewind the tape upon completion. Do not know why it is becoming difficult to find tape head cleaning products such as this anymore considering that the DVD/VHS players are still being sold.",positive
"My hubby and I bought this Wet Cleaner, due to the fact that we still have VCR's at home. Needed this cleaner to keep the heads clean after much usage. We liked it, but eventually, we will have to join the 21st Century and start getting DVR's  since it is impossible to but new (old) VCR's. It did the job, but this product can not be used all the time!",positive
"This was the perfect fix for my VCR!!  I did have to run it through about three times before it was clean and functional, but worth the time and effort.  Liquid drops do come with it.",positive
I used this Wet Head Cleaner and my VCR is working much better.I recommned this product to those who still use a VCR.,positive
"I have a Sony VHS player that had seen very little use yet I managed to apparently ruin by carelessly slotting a home tape inside which ants had made their lair (life in the tropics!).  Debated cleaning the contaminated heads, but fearing ruining the device I ordered this wet cleaner cartridge instead.  It wiped clean the contaminated heads in one single pass and the playback is as good as new.",positive
"This cleaning tape has solved the problem with two VCR's that I still use.  I don't know how the heads get dirty, but this worked well.",positive
This product was as advertised and came with all of the parts. Reviewers who downgraded it must have received a different item.,positive
"did the job, worked as instructions said and removed the dirt that it needed to. My player was worn out, so it did not help that problem in the tape jumping",positive
"I wasn't able to find one of these in local outlets.  I have a bunch of VCR tapes I want to convert to digital, but my VHS player had given me a &#34;Clean heads&#34; message, and I had noticed more than usual static when I was playing the videos.  This cleared that problem up. ( The &#34;wet&#34; media in the package appears to be isopropyl alcohol, which I will use when the small bottle runs out.)",positive
This piece of garbage destroyed my brand-new Magnavox ZV450MW8 combo player so that nothing works anymore. Amazon owes me a new recorder!!!,negative
"Did the perfect job for me,, I have an old VCR, i thought was not working,, so I thought I would at least try cleaning the heads,,Most stores now a days do not sell this product anymore,, but Luckily I found it on Amazon,, and A GREAT price too,, It worked Excellent,, MY VCR is working again,, just from the cleaning tape,,,thanks",positive
this cleaner works very well it is just as advertised and I would recommend this to anyone who needs a cleaner.,positive
We still use our VCRs to watch older tapes and occasionally the units get dirty and project striations on the screen so that the picture is obscured.  This happens probably once a month.  A couple drops of the Maxell VCR Wet Cleaner on the cleaner unit clears up all problems.  The product does exactly what it advertises.,positive
cleaned my old vcr heads pretty good.  quality of the tape playing after cleaning increased slightly enough to backup a good vcr tape to dvd,positive
"I have three VCR's - A Sony DVD and VCR Player/ Recorder, a DVD and VCR  Recorder and Player, and a third VCR player/recorder.  All take the Maxell cleaner in but after about a second of play, they stop.  Virtually no cleaning results.",negative
I could only see a snow screen on my VCR.  Now it's like new!!  I went with the wet cleaner since it looks like that is the best way to clean it if you have big problems.,positive
Excellent VHS head cleaner! Been buying Maxwell products for years now and have never had any problem's or anything at all wrong with them!,positive
It fits in a VCR and shuts it off. Doesn't do anything but jam the VCR and I had to power on and off just to eject this worthless thing.,negative
"keeps the vhs recorder in top shape, great if you use the vcr alot. highly recomend this product. happy taping!!",positive
The Maxell VP-200 VHS Wet Cleaner far exceeded my expections and I will be ordering more of them from you soon. I highly recommend this seller and this product.,positive
I was and still am having thumping noise whenever we use the VCR.  This did nothing to help or fix the problem.  Years ago I used a similar product with great results for a similar problem.... is it because the VCR is old or this cleaner???,neutral
The head cleaner works fine.  I have no issues that I have seen from this product.  It works as advertised.,positive
but VCRs are getting old and so are tapes. Can only remove so much. Good as far as it goes.,neutral
"Tried this in my Sony, JVC, Magnavox and Panasonic VHS VCR's and it does not work on any of them.Don't wast your money.",negative
I needed my old VHS player to work to transfer videos to .MP4 files. This did the trick! Thank you.,positive
"It works but it's expensive.On a side note, I was just playing with it yesterday and i happen to stick it on a hood of a canon 50 1.4 (ES-71II) and to my surprise, it fits it like a glove! It stays there and does fall off. You would think it was made for it! I just thought that was super cool.",positive
Title says it all. This product is so simple and easy to use that even novice photographers should buy this.,positive
"Works just like it should. Serves as a great way to get proper white balance. Just place in front of lens, depress shutter button to focus and light meter, then remove and shoot. Images look much better now.",positive
"I have used this radio for over a year, almost every morning for 30 minutes, and I have only replaced the batteries once.  Great sound, easy to use.  It is a Sony, what else do I say?",positive
"Surprisingly long battery life. After doing the research, this Sony was the one to buy, and it didn't disappoint.",positive
,positive
I've had this radio for months now and really like it. I like the digital tuning and timer function. The battery life is great. I am thinking of buying another one.,positive
"I agree that this is the best shower radio. I have been through (3) other radios, all bad. This unit is true 100% digitial, great reception, good sound quality, and easy to use.",positive
"it's one of the better shower radios for sure, but it still sounds like a shower radio.",positive
"PROS: Good audio, easy to program, good features.CONS:However, the FCC will require broadcasters to switch to a digital format in February 2009.  At that time, the radio WILL NO LONGERr receive televison broadcast audio.  Therefore, a good percentage of the radio's value is gone!Nationwide, the FCC has reserved 10 weather channel frequencies available.  Usually all 10 can't be received.  This radio only has 5 channels for weather.  In my case, none of those 5 channels contains any weather signals.",neutral
"Got this for my girlfriend and she loves it.  She's had it for a little over a year now, and it is working great.  I recommend this product to anyone looking for a good quality shower radio.  She keeps it outside the shower to help keep any water from ruining it.",positive
"I have had this shower radio for several months.  I purchased a similar model for my parents several years ago.  I liked is so much, that I finally decided to purchase one for myself.  Not only can this shower radio withstand exposure to water, but the quality of the sound and reception is excellent for its size.  It is very intuitive to use.",positive
Picked this one up based on the reviews of this site.  Absolutely worth it.  Great sound and ease of use.,positive
This is a nice little radio.  It has good sound quality & it's easy to tune and to set up the clock and the station presets.  The timer function is useful since it does run on batteries.  My only issue is that I wish an AC adapter was included so that I didn't always have to run it on batteries.,positive
"By far the best waterproof multi-band radio on the market.  I am purchasing my second radio only because after nearly several years of abuse from twin teenagers, it finally is starting to wear out.  I will not be without one in my bathroom.",positive
"This is a classic little gizmo. We've used one since the late '90s and, even though the OFF button has long since worn through, it still works like a charm.I've purchased others as gifts for bewildered friends and once they've spent a little time with it they love it.Target and other stores have stopped selling them as off-the-shelf retail, but I hope SONY continues to make this little C-battery shower radio and doesn't screw it up with any ""improvements.""",positive
"I have had one of these for about ten years and love it.  It lives in my shower.  The plastic on top has cracked over the years but it works fine.  i use it to listen to the local tv station news in the morning.  i just bought two more for my kids.***** Note- Since TV has gone digital, I can no longer catch the TV station in the morning.",positive
"This radio has been good - I have owned several Sony shower-type radios, and this unit's quality is among the best.  Very good sound, built very solidly, controls are easy to use and understand.  My only wish is that they had better mounting options - I have it hanging from a shower mirror now, there has got to be a better way to mount a radio, with a holster-type bracket or something...",positive
"Great reception, easy to use and good sound for a one speaker radio.",positive
I have tried several waterproof radios and these Sony's are the only ones that work well. If the volume went a little louder I would have given it 5 stars.,positive
The sound quality is pretty good and the radio reception is very good.  Previous shower radios we had were far worse in both areas.  I especially like the programable buttons since we each like different stations.  Even though the screen fogs the LCD is still readbale.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think the price is a bit high for a shower radio.,positive
"A wonderful product. Well-built. Very clear reception. Easy set-up. The flat, broad bottom is a great feature as it prevents tipping it over when it is placed on a surface such as a sink.Be aware that the TV channel reception feature will cease in 2009 when all transmission goes digital. Until then, enjoy it!",positive
"This is without a double the 'best' shower radio I have ever owned.  The reception is crisp and clear and I love the pre-programmable stations.  It is also a very attractive radio and so when not in the shower with me, it looks nice sitting on my bathroom counter.  It's very user friendly; no complicated directions.  Perfect for us 50+ technically challenged.  I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.",positive
"I purchased this for my dad who uses it in a basement sauna.  The radio sounds nice and is easy to use, but does need to be positioned a bit for good reception.  He is very happy with the radio.",positive
This radio is nice with digital display and nice membrain push buttons. the battery capacity is good.. lasts a long time.. the thing that is disapointing is that you can not recieve any weather stations even though other radios in the area do!! also the am reception is no better than the 20 year old radio I replaced..,positive
"The radio seems good at first but they don't hold up to long-term use in the shower. I've had two of these which have died after several months of use, and am trying a different brand instead.",negative
"I selected this radio for myself several years ago and I have found that all claims for it are true.  It has excellent reception, clear sound, and the batteries last forever.I don't use mine in the shower itself, but sitting on the cabinet. Volume is very good.My recent purchase was a gift; there was no other shower radio that seemed to work as well. They were cheaper, but if they don't work, what have you gained?",positive
"If your looking for a radio for your shower, then look no further.  This gets great reception and the timer to shutoff feature is very handy.",positive
Reception is outstanding.  Easy to set up stations.  Timed on/off is automatic. Easy to read display. Great sound for a mono speaker.  Battery life is amazing.  Worth the price.  I would happily repeat the purchase if I manage to wreck this radio.Update:  The TV function of this radio is not functional with the digital TV change over.,positive
"Very easy to use basic functions. Good tone, sufficient volume. Don't know what I would change, if I could. Well done.",positive
"Worked well, but after about one year it died.  I'm guessing water got into it.  My daughter used it in her shower, and I'm thinking she allowed it to be directly exposed to the shower.",negative
"I have used the headphones for 2 years -- they offer a material reduction in the ""droning"" noise on airplanes.Even when I am ready to sleep and I turn my music off, I leave the headphones on and it reduces the ambient noise.I think you arrive much less fatigued.",positive
I own these and the Bose Quiet Comfort 2 ($250.00) and I can honestly tell you the Bose phones are NOT impressively better and certainly not worth $250.00.,positive
"VHS-C is out of date these days, but these are just as good a quality as they were when they were the main format. Recorded a few things with my old camcorder, no issues.",positive
A very good product.,positive
"These tapes worked nicely in my old JVC camcorder. They did make a bit of noise when recording and playing back, though. For some reason other tapes didn't do this. But it was a very faint sound, and I am happy.",positive
I cannot find thm anywhere else!!  You all have a good price for them too. I wonder if I may order more? But first I'd like to find the ones I needed!! You sent them to the Wrong place!,negative
havent had chance to use the tapes in camcorder yet. I bet i will use this year welll i hope,positive
I recommend this products but today may Concorde not use more but it is good  when I have 6 years ago,positive
I have only used it one time and so far I am quite satisfied. Will order again in the future.,positive
"worked just as i needed,, I know its old style ,,but hey this works for me and my older video camera",positive
this tapes came out o.k just like i expected for my camcorder real nice colors and easy to deal with.,positive
"These are great tapes and are getting harder to find,I love my old camera and these tapes keep it working for me.",positive
These tpes fit perfectly and have been very reliabl eon my video shoots. I will be purchasing more in the future.,positive
"She loves these!  Although Prime is no longer a 2 day process, she still received it in soon enough to take more recordings of her grandchildren.",positive
"It works for me. That's all it has to do. It was and still is, an interesting idea who's time came and is still with us.",positive
Pretty easy to use and down load programs for someone that can spell kompooter 2 out of 3 times.,positive
"This is my first DVD after thinking about it for two months.  I've only purchased it since DVD's are entering the Rental market.  With 500 lines of resolution (Using the S-video connector cable), this system has the same  picture quality of any current DVD player (dont be fooled!), The sound can  still be decoded for dolby surround.  Great Buy!",positive
"I was initially concerned about buying the RCA 5220P DVD player after several of the reviews I read here. However, I decided to give it a try and am thoroughly glad I did. Great picture, great sound! Plenty of features. I  have not experienced a single problem with error messages on any of the  DVD's I've purchased. This is one great little machine for the price!",positive
"This is ok if you just want a cheap, portable radio but the reception leaves a lot to be desired. Many AM stations that are easy to get on my other radios were non-existent on this.",neutral
I wanted a radio to listen to NPR for a few minutes in the morning without putting on the stereo.  I did not want a CD or tape player.  This is a good little basic radio and I am pleased with it.,positive
"This radio might work better if you live in areas with strong radio signals. In the fringe area I live in, it doesn't work at all,whereas the little ten dollar Panasonic RF-P50 Pocket AM / FM Radio works quite well.",negative
"So great, I bought one for everyone in my family.  The ultimate Christmas present.  Great range, clear sound and when plugged in it charges the batteries.  Incredibly durable too.",positive
"For the price, you can't beat this sturdy radio.  Great sound, and durable.  Use it in the garage and around the deck and it's got great volumn and clarity.  You can't beat the deal that GE is providing.  Second model owned, had their original model for 13 yrs and was so impressed I got a new one.",positive
I bought the original version of this radio back in the late 70s. We've had this one for over two years.  It's a great basic radio with loud enough sound for shop/work use.  We left it in the Vegas sun and it melted the case a little.  It still works!,positive
This radio does a great job of receiving local channels and picks up AM stations from hundred of miles away.,positive
"If you like to listen to AM talk radion, sports or news this radio is unbeatable.  I have the Sony ICF SW7600GR and the AM section can't hold a candle to the Superadio III.Personally I think the tuning and volume pods are smooth and fairly precise compared to what others have found.  I am amased that this unit gets the job done for $40.00.It does what it says.  Hope this is helpful.",positive
"It is very large but does have pretty good sound and reception, I live in an area where some people cannot get half of what I get on this unit....buy again because of performance...yes.....buy again .... maybe not because of size being so large....",positive
This was my third purchase of this Model.  I had been using these for listening to stations distant to my rural home for several years but this 'New' set didn't have near the range or tone quality of the prior sets that I had purchased over the  years.  I changed to CC Radio plus Sets which do what I had wished this GE set would do.,negative
"I've owned a GE SUPERADIO since 1985. Works great. Sounds Fantastic. Pulls in stations from great distance.  Seems bulletproof. I especially enjoy the Old School knobs and dials. They are no- brainers. Spin the dial, turn it up. Done. No digging into digital layers.",positive
"I bought this radio in the early nineties to be my night companion. It's showing signs of wear now, doesn't tune like it used to, and the antenna doesn't stand up anymore (keeps flopping over), but the SuperRadio has been more than worth the money, although I don't remember buying it for as much as they want for it here!",positive
I Like this radio. Pulls in AM stations great. Has nice sound quality. I've even dropped this on the floor a few times. Still works great. Very durable. Battery life is excellent! Happy with this radio.,positive
"Good sound, good options. A bit larger than you might think from the picture. Sound is good, as is reception. I have it on the back corner of the desk as background music.",positive
Really excellent reception.  Very good sound quality.  Separate treble and bass controls.I was surprised by the good reception.  Highly recommended.,positive
I recently recieved this item. The reception is about the same as my Grundig s350. I took off 1 star  because on fm I cant get 103 cleary but my grundig can get it better. Is it because the antena is too small? Or is it that I need to modify it??? The am reception is good. The sound is better than the grundig s350!!! Over all the radio is good.,positive
"Very sensitive radio on AM, widely considered the best buy for the money by far.  Very popular in prisons because of its daytime distance performance.Sound is top rate.Dial calibration is poor but you can  get used to it.It's exactly as sensitive as the CCRadio at $160 with  much better sound than the CCRadio.  Lacks only the CCRadio's digital  tuning.  Sorry, Art Bell.",positive
"I bought this a while back for the garage and was fairly disappointed. It uses old tuning technology and the station would continually drift. The sound was ok, but a little bassy. I'm guessing a lot of people buy it for nostalgic reasons. I ended up selling it.",neutral
"it is sensitive and because of it range, you can tweek in stuff from far away, and then flick a switch and pow even more range....had a halicrafters 3 band radio beck when I was a kid, it had range with the external antenna, but this is a very good radio, under battery power or plugged in..............good buy for the price!!!!!",positive
Work well for signing things,positive
"This stylus is metal with a high quality plastic tip, thus giving it some needed weight and smoothness when compared to Palm's pure plastic &quot;cheapo&quot; stylus.  The end unscrews and reveals a pin to reset your Palm in the rare case it crashes.  A small purchase that makes a big difference.",positive
"Why Are You Even Reading The Reviews?  They Get Lost Easily, They Get Easily Left At The Office, And They're Inexpensive...Go Get Some More...",positive
Exactly what I needed to use the touch screen on a Alpha DC power rectifier. Also works with a JDSU T-Berd 8000.,positive
I'm not one to complain much but I hate old products that get mixed in with the new. This is one I should have returned but missed my chance due to events happening. This was ordered by mistake. I'm sure it works just not for any of my devices.,negative
"My new IIIXE came with a flimsy plastic stylus which was not particularly easy to grip or manipulate.  These replacement styli are plastic and brushed metal, prividing a much better grip and improved heft.",positive
"You never know when you're going to need it. A good traveler always knows where his towel, err, stylus is at all times!",positive
Not the same as the original.  Fits too small so had to put tape around it to make it fit.,neutral
"Trust me it does not work. I have tried it on all rooms, anddoes not transmit. Waste of money. If you want an item that does work I have found the SBC wireless to be the best and you can buy it at amazon or walmart.",negative
I bought this a few years ago and works well for the phone connection that my DVR's require.  I've had no problems with this unit.,positive
I purchased this product to provide phone connection to my DSS receiver. I do not have a phone line in that area and this seemed like a nice solution to the problem. This is a low data rate application and voice quality is clearly not of concern. The product was easy to install and worked perfectly for this application.,positive
"I got this for a friend to use on his dial up modem, and it works flawlessley.Great buy.",positive
"Used a Panasonic 2.4Ghz phones as the extension and it would not get a dial tone.  Plugged in a simple corded phone and it worked just fine.So, beware, the operation of the unit is uncertain.",negative
"These worked OK for a while, then they died.  Reset button and repeated attempts to connect failed.Not recommended.",negative
"If you need to add a phone extension without cables or need to hook up a fax machine this product is ok, but for modems and internet connections, your speed will go dooooooown to 9600 or even less.",negative
"Despite several attempts (including changing locations) I was unable to get a strong enough dial tone for my fax.I have seen that a real wireless 2.4 mgh phone extension system is available in Europe but not in the US, where I only find powerline systems.",negative
"The headline on this review says it all.  I'm not mechanically gifted in the least but this RCA Wireless Phone Jack did not test my technical acumen.  (Thank goodness).It's easy to set up, just click in a couple of leads, plug it in the wall and voila!, instant dial tone, good to go and Bob's your uncle.",positive
"I installed this product and tried several A/C outlets,but the phone always produced backgound hiss and static.Within a week it quit working and I could not get the transmitter light to come on after that so returned the unit for a refund.  I got a different brand that does not have the background noise.  I hope it lasts.",negative
"This product does not have caller ID and makes a hissing sound that is irritating. I bought it from BuyAccessories, who weregreat with customer service and refunded my purchase. I will buy from them again. It's not their fault the product is mediocre.",negative
this little gizmo works fine for most phones but it DOES NOT work with phones with caller ID.  Keep that in mind when you're considering a purchase.  Works great with the others.  Overall a nifty little device.,neutral
I bought this a few years ago and works well for the phone connection that my DVR's require.  I've had no problems with this unit.  This was an expansion for RCA RC926.,positive
These RCA wireless connectors are okay for basic phone conversation over short distances.  Don't bother trying to use them for data such as with TiVo or a computer.  They simply won't work.  They use a fairly old technology and even basic phone conversation can result in interference from other devices in the house.,negative
"I thought I ordered both receiver and transmitter, had to re-order by phone. They told me they would send me a R.A. by email and I never got it now I'm stuck with two orders.",negative
"I bought this product to connect my Directv line. There is 25ft. between sender and receiver. All I get on my phone is static. I have tried SEVERAL locations in the room. I have tried to contact RCA (Thomson Inc.)all you get is a recording, you can't get a live person. You can't even talk to a technical support.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!",negative
"This extension requires one of the following Wireless Phone Jack Systems: RCA RC 926, GE GE926 or D916.  (per packaging).  It does NOT work with the RCA RC 930, which Amazon is bundling with it.  Don't buy it with the RC 930!",negative
"Excellent product while it lasts.  I have yet to have one of these last for more than four months.  I usually purchase a few at time so that I always have a spare for when ever it no longer works.  Because the telephone is so uncomfortable to hold, a handset is a necessity and this is the best one to have.  Unfortunately, it does not last for too long.",neutral
I've owned several of these items and all were inferior and really useless. This unit fits well and the sound quality I hear is superb. I've asked those I've talked with how they hear me and they say it is also loud and clear. Guess I'd have to give it a total of five stars.,positive
There appears to be an engineering flaw in the plug connection for the microphone wire.  I have two of these units where you can hear the caller but they cant hear you.  This is too bad because the sound quality is very good for the price.,negative
The only thing it was missing is the volume slider with mute button. I had it on the previous Uniden headset. Otherwise it works great and I am happy with the 3 I bought.,positive
Headset is comfortable and works well. I can still get things done around the house while talking on the phone and this is a great help.  Only drawback is that microphone is mounted on plastic mouth piece and this limits adjustability for the distance from mouth to microphone.,positive
This is a great headset.  The volume is just a little lower than I would have expected but overall I am very happy with this headset and I would buy another if I had the need.,positive
This is the 5th wireless phone jack I have purchased.  It worked for maybe 2 months then died.  Tried to reset but it would not connect. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,negative
Used this for all of about 5 minutes.  Couldn't connect at all.  Gave one star only because I couldn't give 0.,negative
Unfortunately this wireless modem jack had a substantial amount of line noise.  I was able to connect to the internet at 1/10th the normal speed due to the insufficient connection.  I will give this to another family member to try in a newer house.,negative
"This worked well to transfer a caller ID signal to an area where I have a cable box and TV.  This was very good for my needs, but I did listen to the line and it was noisy when using some outlets.  I also had a tough time finding two different outlets that would ""talk"" to each other and transfer the caller ID signal; but after a lot of trial and error it seems to work flawlessly.",positive
"It was difficult to set up, and it does NOT work with the RC920 extension that Amazon is combining with it, but it does ultimately work.",neutral
"I made the mistake of buying the RCA Wireless Phone Jack to connect my TIVO downstairs in the living room where I don't have a jack.  It did not work.  Once I finally re-read what I needed, I bought the RCA Wireless Modem Jack.  It works perfectly and I haven't had any problems.",positive
I bought this for a spare bedroom where we did not have a telephone jack. Installation was a snap and it works great. Sound quality is awesome and in addition you can use it to connect an access point router to expand the reach of your Wi-Fi network.,positive
"I tried this to use a fax two floors above my Vonage phone modem with fax outlet and performance was very spotty.  Sometimes it worked, but many times I'd get a ""poor line condition"" error message when I tried to fax.I finally broke down and ran telephone wire to that room through the walls.  It was a pain, but I finally got my fax to work all the time.",negative
Works ok. Not worth the price tag new. I purchased refurb for half the price of new. Sounds is not CD quality. Sound is similar to FM radio as the device broadcasts over a FM signal. I live in a condo and placed 1 speaker in each bedroom and hooked the unit up to my stereo in the living room. Now I can listen to my Comcast Music Choice and CDs thru out my home.,negative
Liked the reception of this vs. the Garmin unit I had previously. But soon learned that maps are the way to go. I upgraded to a Map330 soon after trying the 315.,neutral
"This is my first GPS unit and I could not be more pleased.  It is simple to use and easy to carry.  I have used it to mark Civil War battle sites and to find bench marks.  It takes me right to the bench marks.  If you are looking for a good unit, the 315 is the one you are looking for.",positive
"Screen small...hard to read while driving.Battery eater. I use the DC adapter, however.No maps.Not enough contrast on screen. With sunglasses while driving, can't see screen.Tiny print on &quot;Goto&quot; destination. Impossible to read while driving.Good, quick operation once you learn it..Does everything it says it will.I like it except for the above things....",positive
"I have a couple DVDs that had relatively small scratches on them, but deep enough to stop playback and I was able to get them to work correctly.  It did take a couple applications, but the sections where the DVD would stop and shut off, now play continuously through.  Make sure to follow the directions and wipe as the instructions say and the disc will work fine after everything dries.",positive
"I bought this repair kit so I could watch a rental movie.  It had quite a few scratches and was skipping during the early parts.  After I was done, I had even more scratches and the movie skipped in the exact spot it did before.",negative
I bought 2 of these kits hoping they would work.  I have found them absolutely useless at $10+ per kit.  I will continue to search for a product/system that REALLY works.,negative
Bought these for a long airplane ride. They worked pretty well for a few days but then the right side went out. That seems to be pretty common with this set. Also the battery compartment is in the cord and in a really awkward position where it hangs free and pulls on the headphones on one side.,negative
"I got these headphones long time ago and still enjoy them! They are so good - you just listen to your music and nothing else outside. They have few jacks to fit to different systems, so it can be universal to many audio electronics. Also it stratches somewhat, so it can fit to different sizes of head.",positive
"These were great at first purchase, but they did not hold up very well. They were used only inside the home and handled carefully.  One side speaker went and then a few months later, the other one stopped as well.  They lasted less than one year.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.We opted INSTEAD for PHILLIPS O'NEILL SHO9561/28.  These are extremely comfortable around your head, noise-reducing, fab sound.",negative
"Very nice.  I used them as wireless headphones for quite some time before finding myself in a situation where I needed a headset and microphone combination.  I remembered that these had that feature - it was not one I could figure out on my own though, I did need to reference the directions as to where to plug everything in at, but maybe that's just me.  Anyway, once they were all set, they functioned wonderfully!",positive
"There is a slight reduction in regular, low-frequency noise as in air travel, but these are not nearly as effective as Bose or Audio-Technica.",negative
"I had these for only a few weeks and they have quit working entirely.  Fiddling with the cord doesn't help.  For $50, I expected much better quality.  I am sadly disappointed and will not buy any headphone that says ""Maxell"" again - you can't trust anybody these days, they've all gone for cheap and to heck with quality.",negative
"The sound quality is good, the fit comfy and the close-fitting cups make for good sound isolation even without the NR on.  When you turn on the NR, though, you'll hear that annoying jet engine hiss disappear into a faint background hum.YES.  I don't even listen to music with these.  I put them on, turn them on and then just SLEEP for the flight.AWESOME.",positive
"I got these headphones in June. By August the sound in one ear was cutting out. I could move the wire and get it back temporarily. Fine, if you don't move your head. Now it's October and the sound in that ear is gone for good. That good price for noise cancelling headphones, isn't so great for only 5 months. Guess they are meant to be disposable.Don't waste your money!",negative
These cassette tapes work well for my needs.I use them for lectures and not for music.I'm happy that they are still available.,positive
"I have used Maxell Cassettes for over 30 years and never have been disappointed.  If you ar an audio purist, don't purchase this, go for the higher bias.  For normal folk like me with tin-pan ears, this product carries audio to near perfection and at a real bargain price, whether that price is retail or sale.",positive
"it's funny to appreciate a source for these tapes, but I do.  I may be old fashioned, but I still like using my cassette player and tapes.",positive
"I immediately passed this link to friends still using Magnetic Cassette tapes. They are getting harder to locate and this brand, length and packaging are excellent. Arrived on time and in perfect condition. I might add that the box looked like it had a hard shipping experience. No damage to tapes, or their plastic cases.",positive
"I ordered micro cassettes and got these, I was angered by the miscommunication and went with another seller, got exactly what I wanted so I am happy. I did not try these out. I don't have a standard cassette recorder.",negative
"I always order these cassettes online. Although people now use CD's, I give a taped session to my clients as a courtesy so I don't have to deal with burning CD's. Buying online is less expensive and easier to find. Saves me the trouble of locating a store that still carries them. Usually one Walgreen's that I know of has them but its hit or miss.",positive
"if you love to record music from cd's or the radio, & dont want to pay an arm & a leg for good quality tapes, these are for you!  i have bought 3 '15' count packages of them so far. im very happy. i intend to buy more.",positive
"SO FAR, I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE THESE CASSETTES OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH NO PROBLEMS IN THE QUALITY OF SOUND PRODUCED BY THEM, I REALLY ENJOY THE BLANK TAPES AS I AM ABLE TO DO WHAT I NEED TO GET DONE, NO PROBLEMS.",positive
I just wrote a review on 160 Maxell tapes (3 pack).  This 4 pack  of 120 minute is a good buy of fine quality reliable blank tapes.,positive
"Two relatives still have multiple VCRs and they tape a lot of stuff.  Tapes wear out over time so I buy them new tapes once a year or so.  These tapes are a very good price and last for a long time even though my Mom and aunt tape over them maybe hundreds of times in a year.  I have never gotten a ""bad"" tape or had tapes break.",positive
If you have an old VCR that still works and you enjoy taping your TV shows you now know how hard it is to find tapes. This will more than likely become even harder.  We located these on Amazon. They are a great buy and are becoming very difficult to find. These Maxwell takes are of very good quality and the prices if fantastic.,positive
I needed some new VHS tapes and these fit the bill perfectly. They have been working well and I'm very pleased with them. Amazon has really good prices on everything anyway so I knew I would find a really good deal and I did!,positive
"there's not much choice for vhs tapes now, I'm happy I can still find them on Amazon. I would give this a better rating if one of the tapes hadn't had a broken piece internally, I could hear it rattling and when I took the tape apart there was a piece snapped off. but they were cheap enough that I didn't bother to return the package.",neutral
"These are really nice tapes, they record well the first time and re-record over and over. Still have a vcr to record tv occasionally and these work well",positive
I have used these VHS Tapes before and the quality is great each time.  I will buy these the next time for making copies.  Darryl,positive
"If you still use a VCR, these Maxell video tapes are a good quality. I have used them both for everyday recording of television shows and a one-time use for recording a movie I want to keep.",positive
"Great price and delivery. We cannot often stay up later to watch a favorite show, so we tape it and are able to watch it later. Maxell makes a good product that lasts.",positive
"I have used Maxwell for some time. I liked the price and having used these in the past, you can retape over them many, many times. I use them to tape television shows on air after my bedtime. You get good, clear pictures even after several months of taping. I would reorder these again. Also, there are few, if any, places locally to purchase any brand of VHS tapes.",positive
"Practical and affordable, as usual. That's the &#34;maxell&#34; brand.It still gives you quality & integrity with each and every product.",positive
"I use these tapes because unfortunately I still live in the 20th Century, and still enjoy taping movies. One day, I will order a DVR, but for the time being, these tapes are great!",positive
"It's nice to know the possibility is there to find them. With them and VCR players (next thng I,ll be looking for.",positive
"We bought a VCR for nostalgic reasons.  We, like everyone else, got rid of our VCR back when we made the transition to DVD, but in the last couple years we longed for a bit of nostalgia, so we bought a VCR, some tapes and these blank tapes to re-experience what it was like watching VHS as kids. These are good tapes. They play well.",positive
"VHS tapes, got them for my grandma, I'm sure they allow her to record the price is right without any trouble.",neutral
"Of course this is a great, great buy... you don't have to pay a lot for quality VHS tapes anymore so we didn't. We got a bargain.",positive
"I still use videotapes for easy, uncomplicated recording of things I don't plan on keeping indefinitely.  I've used two tapes from the pack I bought and they are just fine.  No problems so far.  Am rating 4 rather than 5 only because I haven't been using them long, and I haven't done much re-recording, which is something else I do.  I may buy more before it becomes impossible to buy them!",positive
"This was fantastic, you see my husband and I have a unit that requires VCR tape and we tape our soap operas and this is the only way we can get them. Stores just don't have what we are looking for",positive
"I admit I still use a VCR, & probably will forever, just seems to work better for me.  These are hard to find these days, so glad you can get here & the price is good. It's a quality item as I use these over & over & they never give me problems.",positive
"These do the job expected. No problems with recording or playing.It seems VHS tapes are being phased out, at least I can't find them in local stores anymore.These do at least as well as what I've used in the past.",positive
The price was right and the quality is what you'd expect on a vhs. I am using these to record mini-dv films and would recommend,positive
Maxell is a well trusted brand that has quality products. Bought these because I still use a video recorder. Have never had any problems with them and am sorry to see them go.,positive
A couple of the tapes required break in and I suggest a fast forward and rewind before you start recording. I have DMRs and record TV shows on EP mode. Both sound and video are good even on a 60&#34; 3-D Plasma and 350w sound system.,positive
Very happy with this product.  It arrived in record time and the tapes work well with my VCR's. Would recommend to otheres that are still using VCR's.,positive
I like to tape a lot on my vcr and this is a quite reliable product.  I will continue to purchase these.,positive
These VHS tapes are good but after I got them I realized that I needed more time but this was no fault of the Manufacturer and since they are no longer available it does not matter now.I have found them at another website with more hours.  Now I just have to remember how to use them to my advantage.,positive
Excellent 4-pack of tapes. Been buying Maxwell for years now and never have had any problem's or been unhappy at all!,positive
"Had them shipped directly to my brother on the other side of the state.  He is a little &#34;old fashion&#34; and still records on tape.He tells me that the quality of his recorded material plays back great, especially the football games.",positive
I bought these to use with my vcr little did i know my hdtv will not accept my on air vcr lol so now even though its a great buy...im going to use this some other time i'm glad i bought it though.,positive
"Good tapes that can be recorded many times and are easy to remove from box. If you still use tapes, use these!!!",positive
These are wonderful for recording anything you like if you still have a VCR!  I will use them and order more!,positive
"If you still use blank VHS VCs like I do, this three pack is really handy. I know that most of us are using DVDs now, but I still find a use at times for an eight or nine hour VC and this fills the bill. This tape stands up pretty well to being used over and over and I would surely suggested it if tape is what you need.",positive
"These tapes are oustanding. Brillant picture. No tracking problems. I used to buy another name brand 8 hour, to many tracking problems. First time buyer for Maxell very happy with the product excellent price and quality.Believe me I have gone through tapes since VCR;s first came out still have the original GE VCR. Cannot go wrong with the Maxell.",positive
I gave these tapes an OK rating because they were OK for recording only one time on them but if you had to re-record on them they were no good and unfortunately I found this out the hard way. I would only recommend  these tapes to someone who is only going to use them one time.,neutral
"Great product that performs exactly as needed.  Great look to it and could not be more pleased.  I live in the absolute boondocks, 88 miles from the nearest WalMart, 50 miles from even a McDonalds burger stand.  I absolutely count on amazon.com to order things I need, they are nicely delivered by mail, UPS or FedEx and spare me the need to travel long expensive miles for some of the simplest things.  AMAZON.COM ROCKS!!!!",positive
My husband was very please with these VHS tapes and he was excited about the price.  He would definitely purchase more at a later date.,positive
"Perfect for people like my daughter who like to record their favorite shows to watch after work at night. With up to 8 hours on a tape, you can get quite a few shows on one tape (of course I don't recommend recording on slow speeds if you want to keep a quality recording.)A perfect solution for those who don't want the expense of Tivo or similar devices.",positive
"I use these at work, and the sound is great and the cord frees me from my desk.  (I often have to travel around the building.)  I work with computers andI wasn't sure how it would work with all of the electrically noisy  equipment around us but it works great!  Highly recommended!",positive
"Fine sound, good reception over a decent range (looks like I can get around the yard without them making any big complaints), comfortable.I would say that the fidelity is only slightly less than the earbuds I'm used to.  And the separation is better than I expected.  There is a fair amount of hiss if no music is on, but I'm pretty picky and I think its totally tolerable.",positive
"Overall very pleased with the product. The phones are lightweight, comfortable, and the sound quality is good anywhere in our house &amp; yard. The quality of construction of the phones and the base unit is good. There is an ample supply of cables &amp; adapters, i.e., for plugging into  a computer soundcard.",positive
"Used it as directed on a polkaudio cd player, and it did not improve the machine.  Cannot say for sure that the product didn't work, or the machine is just broken.  Machine started to not recognize certain cds that it played before.  Using the cleaner did not improve the machines performance.",neutral
"Works very well.  Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem.  Easy to follow audio directions.",positive
"This product is a wast of money,it is not thing but a cd disc with some soft brushes on it for to spinning around trying to clean the cd player laser eye and this cd disc thing can't clean the laser eye at all.Most portable cd player this day are lid open anyway.You properly can clean the laser eye with a cotton swab with a dip of a little rubbing alcohol.That what I used this product for.",negative
"Dont waste the money.Used multiple times on two different units, did NOTHING to either......DON'T BOTHER.",negative
I thought my expensive old Sony CD player was finished - it skipped and sound was not as good.  Allsop restored the player to original good quality.  I highly recommend this product.,positive
"I can't say with any certainty that it's the end all laser cleaner. It's ingeneous approach does seem clever though. Consumers buy this product when their CD player starts skipping. I did too. If you're  lucky enough that the problem is a dirty laser, you're in luck. One cannot expect this humble product to fix a mechanical or lubrication problem. Good luck, it's definitely worth a try.",positive
"THIS CD CLEANER HAS MORE BRUSHES TO DO A LITTLE MORE CLEANING TO A CD PLAYER, BUT IT'S NOT ADVANCED ENOUGH FOR A CAR CD PLAYER.",positive
"Over the course of the last few months my CD player had gone from the occasional skip to eventually not being able to play a CD at all. 5 minutes after my package arrived with this CD cleaner in it and I was playing CDs again. I can also play CDRs now, something my stereo hasn't been able to do for six months.",positive
I purchased item for my PC/laptop/boombox/DVD player.Just for maintenance to keep eye lens clear of any dirt/dust after using it on all of 3-5 items their was a coat of dust/dirt on disc.WOW what a surprise I try to keep my electronics clean  & dust free every 2-3 months but dust/dirt seem to find it's way inside electronics.,positive
"This product really does make a difference.  I had an older CD player that was doing a lot of skipping, and sometimes it would not function at all.  I ran the cleaning disc through it once, and now it's working just fine.  Great item to have around even if you only need to use it once a year... certainly beats having to buy a new CD or DVD player!",positive
I have only used it once and it cleared the skipping problem. It has an interesting method to the way it works by playing a piece of classical music while the lens cleaner cleans the lens.,positive
Tried this on our 2004 Toyota Highlander. The CD player wouldn't even read the disk. Tried several times. Don't waste your money.,negative
"Can't say enough good things about this. It took less than a minute to clean my very dirty car CD player. I was shocked that it worked so fast ! Just listen to the voice and switch to track 3, then after the music on the cleaning disk stops, remove the disk and your done. Unless they came out with a better product, I don't know why they stopped selling this one !",positive
My professional CD players have always performed well.  They are &#34;broadcast quality&#34; units and it is just not acceptable to have them skip or not read a disc.  One of my players recently began to do just that and I was hoping to just get the lens cleaned with a laser-lens cleaner.  This particular product did the job and so far the unit reads better and does not skip anymore.,positive
"This laser-lens cleaner works well for what we intended to use it for, it helps to eliminate dust from our CDs.",positive
"These are good cd cleaning wipes for cleaning fingerprints, stain, and other marks on a cd to avoid going to a dvd store to get it cleaned. Good additions for cd protections.",positive
I USED THIS ON A DISK I WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH. AFTER I USED THIS THE DISK PLAYED FINE.THE INSTRUCTIONS TOLD ME TO WIPE ON THE SIDE WITH NO PRINTING. I WAS ALWAYS WIPING ON TOP.,positive
I down load a lot of CD's and need to keep them nice and clean. I will use these wisely and keep all my music cd's clean from finger prints and dust. Thank you so much. Beverly,positive
Had old movies that we were unable to view because they kept skipping. Gave them a good cleaning and all were view able.,positive
I have a Netflix subscription and receive DVDs in the mail. There are a high number of these discs that have scratches and smudges on them. Rather than send it back because it won't play correctly I give them a quick wipe with these cloths and have had success with almost every DVD.,positive
There is really not much you can say about a clean wipe. The product does clean fingerprints on the DVD. I'm very satisfied with the product. If it had come with a small bottle of a cleaning solution it would be even better.,positive
You can use a clean piece of cloth to clean your disk.  It did not remove the scratches from my disk.  Waste of money.,negative
"Pretty simple product.  There are about 30 or so sheets in a package. Take one out and wipe in a circular motion.  Gets rid of the smudges and makes the disc shine.  However, if your kids touch it with grimy fingers it will struggle to remove those types of stains.",positive
"These are indespenisible around our house. Out grandchilden find then and play with them.  I've witnessed them trying to get our wee dog, Nola, to catch as one would catch a frisbee.  Thankully, we have only totally lost a few CD's.  Easily replacable!",positive
I use these wipes all the times on my electronics. They are lintless and have many uses besides wiping clean CDs and DVDs. I use them from time to time to clean VCR heads too. I just cut a small section and saturate it in alcohol. It works a treat. I highly recommend them.,positive
"Very handy. And reusable. well, .....now I have to provide more words.... Handy, handy, handy! I just need to remember to use, especially on RENTAL DVDs.",positive
This was the first time I have used such a product and was pleased with the results.  Works great for a fast clean before playing,positive
I got these to clean dirty DVD and Bluerays that I got from Netflix. Works great. Saves a lot of frustration when a movie stops or skips because of crud on the disk.,positive
"I use these to clean every movie I receive from Netflix. I repurchase these wipes every couple of months to clean rented Blu-Ray movies, Wii, and PS3 games. I prefer to see the dirt I'm removing. Make sure you wipe back and forth, away and towards the center of the disc, instead of wiping in circles, as stated in the directions.",positive
"I just needed a product to quickly wipe down my rented movies, or used DVDs and CDs I purchase online or at garage sales, etc. So far it appears to work well.  Nice price.",positive
Good price but they don't work as good as a mild detergent and warm water.  These still leave fingerprints on the disc.  Good for a quick wipe but not a through cleaning.,positive
these wipes did get the job done but the fabric doesn't hold up long but for a quick cleaning its good just to have around when u are on the go...,neutral
I have looking around for this item for some time. I had some trouble fined them. It work really good.,positive
"At first I thought it was little bit expensive price, but when I get it and use it, it is not, definately worth the money.This CD & DVD wipes really cleans. The wipes is good quality cleaning materials, cleans the dirts and finger prints off the DVDs very well.I definately recommend to give this a try, worth your money, it does the job good. Thanks Amazon!",positive
"I had a DVD that kept on not playing every other disc l got from Netflix. It would say the disc was dirty or scratched. I gave any one that didn't play a good clean with these wipes but rearly got any to work. Maybe if you had dusty CD's but l never got any sense that this was ""cleaning"". More of a light polish. Didn't work for me.",negative
Did not clean my cds as good as it says. they were still scatched.  would not recommend this products to anyone,negative
DVD Fastwipes clean my cd's and dvd's and make them extremely clean it wipes of dust and dirt and does a great job!,positive
I have purchased many of these Belkin Velcro Cable ties over the past few years. They are well made and very useful.,positive
"I love these things, in fact I use them in my backpack to manage the cables I travel with. Power adapters for tablets, phones, chargers and computers, with all that i carry a bunch of cables. so its nice to have these!",positive
"If you have cords that you want to identify or cords that you need to pack away then these are excellent.  I use them on my laptop power cords, headphone cords, etc.",positive
My stereo system was a jungle of wires once i used these cable times I tamed that jungle.  I love that I can remove the cables that I no longer need and add new cables without cutting cable ties.,positive
These work and look exactly as expected.  Easy to use.  What more can I say about Velcro strips? Evidently I need to say more to meet the minimum word requirement to post this review.,positive
This are great. They are high quality. Nothing more to say really except that they work. I use it for all the cables on my computer.,positive
"Cable ties works as they are promised to. Was able to organize the cables behind the TV, looks much better. Preferred to use these over the smaller ties, the larger velcro straps allow multiple larger cables to be bundled together.",positive
They work as I expected they would without too much extra material left over and here are my last words.,positive
"Quick, reusable, and color coded... these velco cable ties are a fast and effective way to cable management.  Easy and reusable, unlike zipties.",positive
"i definitely prefer the radio shack ties because you can adjust the tie to the size of the tie to the cable, and the whole strip is velcro so no extra cable hangs off of the bundle.  but these are a little cheaper and work most of the time too.",neutral
"Good Product and different colors come in handy for using a certain color for a specific device, they are priced right so like me I bought 5 packs that way I have 5 ties of the same color.",positive
"These are OK for wrapping cables behind your desk or something like that, but they do not attach to cables.  If you are putting them on cables that you wrap and unwrap on a regular basis these are not so good.  Seemed to be designed for semi permanent installations, not for daily work",neutral
"For no more than they cost, I would recommend these to everyone. Yes the colors are rather primary and boring, but they are dirt cheap and have withstood daily use and abuse.These travel around in my flight case and camera bags all the time and still work great. I'm ordering more as soon as I finish typing this review.  Seriously, stop reading and just buy them already!",positive
"These were purchased as an &#34;add on&#34; item and must say that they fit the bill in our house.  We use them as a tie on the cords for equipment that we move around the house.  Easy to wrap and unwrap.  Thanks, Amazon!",positive
As someone with far to many computers anything that helps me tame the mess of wires is welcome.  this fit the bill well and I like the tab that makes them easy to remove.,positive
"These are great. That the hooks of the velcro only occupy a small strip on the band isn't a big deal. They hold well, they're colorful, and good quality. My strips from eight years ago still work.",positive
"I use these every day for keeping cords neat since I have a lot of computer equipment, ipad accessories, power cords, etc.",positive
"These little cable ties may not be of the highest quality, but they do work, and you sure get a great deal considering the price.There is only Velcro on part of the strip, so I don't know how long the tie would last if  you were tying and untying it all the time.  What I have found, is that if I just tie something up and leave the cable types alone, these work great.I am happy with them.",positive
"I travel with cpap machine and this works great for my hose, power cord and extension cord. Highly recommended, A+++",positive
I use these all the time to organize my cables and power cords. They are long enough to do a great job (nlike some that are too short to wrap the entire cable).I recommend them.,positive
"This is cool and all, but I was a little upset when I found out I could buy it at the dollar store for about half the price.",positive
"I have been using these for a few years as I use Belkin A/V Pure cables a lot. The colored ones are nice, think I will use them to color code cables.",positive
A simple little product that is a great help in keeping control cords used on a video jib. I like having them in various colors so as to be able to keep track better of several different cords. These are well made.,positive
"I love this things. I use them to keep wires contained and out of the way, and I use them to keep things organized and handy. They can be reused over and over, and the colors help to organize and mark things.",positive
They are simple and easy to use.  The eight inch length will wrap around a fairly large bundle.  I bought  them to use on earbud cables and charger cables for which I trim them to about 3 inches in length.,positive
"Strong velcro grip, long enough to wrap a bunch of cables together, short enough to still be convenient when just wrapping one.  Good product.",positive
I hate having long cords gather up in a pile and look ugly. These ties do the job and make it look more organized.,positive
"Performs as expected from any cable tie. I like that it's Velcro and reusable unlike the stiff plastic ties. I used it to clean up the wires under my desk in my tiny cubicle at work, so that I'm not constantly kicking or stepping on wires.",positive
Belkin has never let me down.  I had order 2 of these packages and used them all - and am ordering more.  I'm also ordering a longer length version.,positive
"It;s so much easier to wrap a long cord and put a velcro tie to hold the cable in a shorter,bundle than having several feet of all the cords.",positive
"They were only a buck as an add on item and work as expected. Honestly, it's easier to use a small plastic rubber band if it's a cord you're going to constantly use...",neutral
"Boo, hiss, buy the 50 count one in my other review. For some reason these are short and they are not designed to stay on a cable like the other ones I reviewed.",negative
I was looking for Velcro ties that had the loop that i could slide the many iPad/iPhone cables i carry through. These ties will keep your cables bundled individually but i would prefer an additional loop or eye for the cable than i would wrap the excess around.,negative
"I've been using these allot latley and these work great! Don't tear or come apart and the velcro is enough for office use. NOT recomended for giging musicians or roadies, these are not strong enough for road use but great in the office.",positive
"Short, sweet, and colorful. Everything you could want in velcro ties. =]I'm not sure how else to rate these. They're as advertised. For me, it was hard to find short sizes, and they were close enough. The colors are an added bonus. They are high-quality, sturdy, and lock together well.",positive
"I love the fact that they work well, don't separate and can hold alot of cords at the same tome.  My husband hates seeing cables all mess - I always have a spare set for him.  All the cables are color coordinated at are place and these are the reason why",positive
"This product is very good: high quality, good service, and fast ship. It is sutable with my think before I got it.",positive
these work for just about anything that you might need them for.  there are only six in the package so you don't get very many.,positive
If you are looking for something to bundle your cords together or if you have mess behind your TV and/or computer I would suggest these to help you get the cords organized.,positive
Fine little Velcro ties. The ties lack a tie to the cable (I use them for extension cords). If they had a small slot to double them back through it in order to fasten them to the cable then I would rate 5 stars.,positive
theres Belkin Velcro Cable Ties (8 Inch) are excellent.  with the color pattern i am able to label both ends of my cables making it a cinch to locate the one I'm looking for.  all of my cables are bound together with the monster cable management system also sold on amazon,positive
Needed some wire wraps (instead of wire ties) to keep my bass guitar amp power cord and equipment cord(s) in place while not in use. I tried some other brands and was more of a &#34;pain&#34; than help. Seen this at Amazon and it couldn't work better. Easy to put on and easy to remove and keeps the cables nicely tied when needed. Get price too even if it is an &#34;Add-On Item&#34;. Thanks : ),positive
Don't spend a lot of money.  Buy these easy to use velcro cable tie wraps that allow you to use and reuse over and over again  Comes in multiple color pack (for that color coding you want to do).  Remember these aren't just for cables.  I've used them to hold shelves together for extra support!  These really stay stuck together!  I've chained a few together for a bigger project I needed help together.  A must have in any household.,positive
"I carry these in my tool box and found them handy to use, especaily with the different colors to chose.  I have used them to temporarily hold something in place while I am trying to drill it in place.  I have even connected severl together for larger items.",positive
"These ties are perfect for managing cords. I like that they are reusable and can color-code your electronics. I use the colors based on sound cords. For example: black/silver for HDMI and red/green/blue for composite.I would recommend getting two packages though, you'll probably need more than you think.",positive
"One inch of the eight is the name tag (belkin), another inch is the hook portion of Velcro.  If there is any movement in the cable bundle you wrapped, it all comes undone, (except that 1"" of Valcro) What a waste of money. Buy something else, I am having to.",negative
"Great wire ties.  Easy to use, release and reuse. The colors make it easy to identify different cords. Highly recommend.",positive
"well, they are velco so they work. they do get lost easily though, kind of wish i had bought a different kind....",neutral
"Umm...seriously? $1.63 for these? These cable ties are really good quality, have a nice long strap with a tight velcro to secure them all. Different colors makes it easier (kind of) to keep things organized, but at the very least it adds a bit of color to the jungle of cables you have.",positive
I don't have much to compare these to except for the heavy duty version that I use for power cables and extension cords in the garage. These are obviously light duty. Works great for computer and game cables. They are atrong enough to hold my Hdmi switch box strapped to the pole of my computer desk to make it easily accessible.,positive
It is Belkin product so it is of high quality.It does the job it was marketed for.I would recommend purchasing the cable ties.,neutral
You can never have enough Velcro cable ties.  I use them for everything.  I also have plenty around. Never know when you need one.,positive
"green ones for hard drive, red ones for DVD-drive, ... blue cable tie to help with fans and wires.Worth every cent.  Every pc enthusiast should have some sort of advanced cable-tie system in place.",positive
These ties are great for something you repeatedly bundle and unbundle like a laptop power cord.  They're slightly expensive per strap but are worth it in my opinion.,positive
"You can buy the same thing at the dollar store. Save yourself the five dollars, but if you want color coding, this will work well for quick visual ID.",positive
"I'll never understand why re-useable cable ties are so expensive, or so unavailable.  These Belkins are really for permanent stereo or computer installation.  And even for that purpose, I don't care for their design.If you are a musician looking to tie up microphone, speaker or instrument cables, these are not suitable.",negative
"Easy to use, I needed them to organize all the cables in my desk, they work but I would rather to get the 6 of them in one single color.",neutral
"These are so much better than using zip-ties!n They're easy to see, and - more important - much easier to remove! How many times have you needed to remove a zip-tie and you had to find something sharp, then hope you didn't cut through whatever you had bundled together?! These are great for the job!",positive
"Nice for small cable bundling, but not enough Velcro for large bundles.Works great in computer cases for cable dressing.",positive
Easy to use velcro fasteners to keep wiring tidy and neat with a belkin labeled pull take to easy undo the fastener. It works.,positive
"I use these to hold my kitchen appliance cords.  They work great, I use to use twist ties, which worked, but these are just so much nicer.  The entire strip is velcro and then the one end has the sticky part.  They come in multi colors.",positive
"They're little velcro straps.  Not much to say here, they work exactly as you'd think they would and do a great job of keeping cables organized.",positive
"If you've got any devices that have cables, this is the best system for keeping the cables controlled.  Whether you're traveling or simply want to gather cables together so they're not hanging or lying all over the place, these &#34;ties&#34; do the job.",positive
"those are exceptionally well made. I used &#34;cheapo&#34;-products before but these are really nice quality and come with a sling on one end that allow you to slide it onto a wire, provided the plug on either side is not too large, so it does not fall off when untied.",positive
the whole tie Velcro to  it self only at the end of it is there the opposite type of Velcro.,negative
This is just a high speed USB cable and is of Belkin's normal good quality.  It does what it is suppose to do and the price is excellent.,positive
I had a printer I needed to connect to and this was great for doing that and the price was great for what I needed it for.,positive
"I had no idea what this cable was because I found it in my drawer one day, I thought it was the VCR cable and I tried to hook it up to the TV and VCR one day and nothing happened except the reception on my TV went bland and empty.",negative
"I had no idea what this cable was because I found it in my drawer one day, I thought it was the VCR cable and I tried to hook it up to the TV and VCR one day and nothing happened except the reception on my TV went bland and empty.",negative
You did a great job sending this printer cable to me! I got it really fast too! thank you!,positive
"Bought it on sale.  Cheapest I found, no problems.",positive
I have been using this cable with my Samsung Laster printer for over 2 years now and couldn't be happier with the no problem performance.Its long enough to be used as a printer cable (which is important) and it works.  What more can you ask for from a usb cable?Much nicer setup than the bulky parallel port setup.,positive
"This cord does what it says, dont waste your money on ""top-of-the-line"" cords they sell at best buy or other palces. They all do the same thing!",positive
Excellent cable.  Very reliable.  Now if only my operating system is the same way....,positive
clean connections and flexible cable. no reason topay 2x or more for any other cable that does justthe same.,positive
"There is not much to say! The Belkin USB Cable works and is priced right on Amazon when compared to the ""Big Box"" stores. If you have a need for this item, get it. You can't go wrong.",positive
"It works great to run a cable from the computer to the photo printer. The Cable works great, love how long it is.",positive
What can I say about belikin?  Belkin makes GREAT products which makes me satisfied with this cable!,positive
Please price this Belkin USB Pro Series 2.0 cable at your local office supply store.  I did.  It is over $20.00.  Another amazing Amazon deal. We have three in use.  Stocking up on a couple of extra at $4.95 each with free shipping is a good idea.  Quality printer cables will only increase in the future.  And the hits just keep on coming.,positive
These are excellent quality USB cables that will allow you to connect any USB device (printer etc.)to your PC or other USB device.,positive
Its always good to have extra USB cables floating around.  2 for home 2 for work and 2 for the laptop/spare.,positive
I bought this cable to use with my new printer.  I've had it for about 2 months now and it's working fine.,positive
"I've always seen high-quality products from Belkin, and this one is no exception. It is a high-quality USB cable at a great price, by a leading computer accessory company. An extra bonus is the lifetime warranty!",positive
"There's no reason at all to buy misc. electronic USB cables anywhere except through Amazon!  Prices at the 'shacks'...'marts'.....and the less'es - usually will cost you more than double for the same electronic items found on Amazon.  So let your motto always be ""Caveat emptor"" i.e., buyer beware!!",positive
I really like Belkin products and this cord works great from my pc to the printer and could not ask for it to do more,positive
Hooked it up between my printer and my PC and printed about 700 pages with it.  Works fine.  Not as quite as cheep as monoprice but the super saver shipping will make up for that if you're ordering more stuff.,positive
"Does the job intended, good value, good quality. Not a bad product for the price.There are better products out there, but not at this price point.",positive
It might be a little short but seems to be a fine cord (don't know what else to say),positive
"I was looking for a USB2 cable to hook up my all-in-one printer, I found this and I don't regret it, the build quality is excellent, I recommend it.",positive
"Considering all the over-priced products on themarket,this cable does the job perfectly and theprice is great.  Thanks Amazon.",positive
"This is a reliable brand and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Great product for the price.  I only needed one, but was tempted to purchase more just because it was a great value.  I would buy again.",positive
package was recieved barely 2 days after i orderd it i am extremely happy  would that all packages arrived asPromptly as this one,positive
Basically needed a longer cord for my USB hub. The stock cable that came with it was SO short. Didn't want to spend a ton of $$ but still needed something with good connectors and decent speed. This did the job without breaking the bank.Would recommend!,positive
Extremely low price at a high quality made. The cost of it is only a small fraction of any cables price at stores.,positive
"I'm not sure how this can be advertised as a Belkin product.  The cord that was sent to me is clear with two bright blue LEDs on the ends.  It works, just bring some sunglasses.",negative
"When I bought a new printer for the computer I use, I needed a USB cable to connect the printer to the hard drive.  I ended up purchasing this USB cable from Belkin. It works great and I've never had any problems with it. Even though the cable is a 2.0 device, it is apparently backwards compatible and will work with most 1.0 devices, too.",positive
"Absolute dependability, no matter the device they connect.",positive
Ran a local networked computer on this wire and had no issues whatsoever.Good quality and no speed issues whatsoever.Update 10-24-2010:Still using the wire for networking with zero issues.,positive
THe item arrived in a timely matter and works great!,positive
"Not much to say since it's just a USB cable.  I ordered it, it arrived, and it works.  I plugged one end into my computer and the other end into my printer and lo & behold I can now print things from my computer, just as you might expect.  It does what it's supposed to do with no problems, so five stars.  Too bad everything can't be that simple.",positive
this cable is very good i recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend it,positive
This makes it much easier to plug and unplug USB devices.  Also allows me to play on my device while it remains plugged in. I measured it to be sure and it is 6 feet and an inch - so they did not short me on the length at all.  I recommend this quality product.,positive
It works. I use it to plug portable hard drives into. The through put seems pretty good. It works fine.,positive
A good quality cable at a reasonable price.  Works as advertised.,positive
"This cable works well and is a good quality product, unlike other cheap cables which sometimes affect the USB transport. I recommend it.",positive
great does whats described sorry cant think of anything else to say except I hate that we have to do this in twenty or more words totally excessive,positive
"It's an extension. Kind of hard to say more than that. It's a Belkin cable, so it's good quality. The ends have molded strain reliefs. This is a USB 1.1 cable, however, so data transfer speeds will be slower. But if you are using it only to charge something, it won't affect it.",positive
"Instead of the pictured Belkin cable, I got a flimsy generic cable.  Total and complete rip off.",negative
This simple usb extension cable seems to be very well made.  It has heavy molded connectors and a flexible insulation on the cable.  Extended my tablet charging cable and works just as it is supposed to do.,positive
"Great USB cable, durable made very well.I use this cable to add a extra USB port on my desk so I don't have to bend over and plug in flash sticks or other USB devices.",positive
"I use a Mac, and everyone knows Mac lovers keep their keyboards.  The one thing is that if you use a Mac keyboard, they have the shortest cord ever.  So I got this and it worked like a charm, giving me that extra distance between my Mac and my keyboard on my desk; keeping the wires off the top of my desk.",positive
"I needed an extension for my wired mouse and this extension was the answer, works great, plug in and go!!",positive
"With the popularity of flash drives and the inconvient USB connections on most computers (in the back or in the front that requires lying on the floor to make the proper connection), a USB extension makes a lot of sense. This one fills the need splendidly.",positive
This is a staple that you must have on hand.  It has so many uses.  It is a good product.,positive
"Good cable, no drawbacks, works fine, clamps on firmly, not much to add here",positive
"This is the best deal you are going to find for these extention cables, great quality.",positive
"It's a cable, what does one say about a product like this. I wanted one and I now have it",neutral
A 2 meter USB extension cable for this price from a reputed maker is a surprise. Works well.,positive
Ii needed this to expand the reach from my laptop that i have connected to the flat screen to the marble mouse and worked fine. Price was good and product is belkin,positive
The cord worked great. I needed a longer cable for my Logitec mouse. The cord fit on there prefectly.,positive
I had a 1996 PC that I needed to run.  It booted up and ran the display.  Unfortunately I did not have a 1996 keyboard.  This adapter filled my need.,positive
Perfect if you have an older type keyboard plug and need to use a PS-2 type keyboard with it.,positive
"Item that arrived was opposite gender from what is pictured, both ends.  In addition, one of the pins was badly bent--something easily fixable, but not in condition to sell.",negative
Use with an opposed adapter to monitor a server with an old rack mount terminal. Worked as expected. 5 star because you can fined these.,positive
It does what it was supposed to do. It works well for the computer it was bought for. thank you.,positive
The package arrived in a timely fashion and in good shape. The adapter is exactly what I wanted and makes the connection I needed.,positive
If you want to use your newly purchased 1984 IBM Model M keyboard with a modern computer using a PS/2 interface. :P,positive
"Perfect, worked exactly as expected. Needed this to attach my Model M keyboard to a KVM switch. So happy, typing on it now!",positive
Affordable and works for us keyboard nerds who love the old style keyboards. I even use this attached to about 2 more adapters and I have no keystroke loss or anything.,positive
It is a good cord.  Simply packaged.  Nicely priced.There is not much more to say about a simple cord.,positive
"Not really much to tell.  I needed a replacement power cord for a computer (puppies chewed the old one), bought this one from Amazon.com, plugged it in, the computer works.  As Jerry Pournelle has said before about Belkin products, it Just Works.  And the price is right.",positive
I needed a replacement cord for my computer and this one works great! Very easy to hook up and at a great price!,positive
Not really much to say other than it being exactly as expected. Lost the cord to my TV (moved it around a lot) and this fit perfectly. Cord doesn't get hot at the connections and fits sturdy into the plugs on each end.,positive
"Cables either work or they don't. Belkin works great; it's now my brand of choice, and I don't look at any other cable other than an Amazon brand cable.",positive
This extension cord is a waste of money and I feel like a tool for ordering it. I should have ordered a cheap one instead. I guess I bought the brand name instead lol FML,positive
I just built a new PC when it dawned on me that I didn't have a power cable. I borrowed my printers and bought this one right away. Cheap and it works. What more could you want?,positive
"A friend of mine gave me an old computer of hers, but the computer lacked a power cord.  Low and behold, Belkin comes to the rescue.  The power cord was perfect for the old PC, but would be good for a new one as well.  It never hurts to have extras on hand when it comes of cords and cable for ANY computer.Great product from a reliable company.",positive
For such a low price it is great! It is true to Belkin quality-low price high quality product; can't be beat,positive
"Somehow in my piles of cables and connectors I managed to lose one of these.  I bought this as a replacement for my Thecus n4100pro server but also tried it on my PS3 and Samsung 26"" LCD tv.  It worked fine on all of them.",positive
This power cord fit the monitor and the outlet.  What more could I ask for?  Worth the $ if you need one of these.,positive
"If its wire, I perfer Belkin. In my opinion its a quality cord. This cord is being used on a monitor and I like the way it lays. It doesn't have a mind of its own. It stays where you put it.",neutral
Works great! I plugged it in to my Acer monitor and image is as it should be. No cut outs and good quality.,positive
"I needed another power cord because I forgot to bring it with me on a trip, so I ordered one from Amazon and got it in two days (Amazon Prime).This Belkin cord has a higher quality than the one that originally came with my PC, and the price is very reasonable.I recommend it highly.",positive
Purchased these for the two hp monitors we picked up at the local goodwill.  Cheaper on amazon than buying at the electronics store and works just fine.,positive
High quality material and brand. You can buy this product to replace any cable if you broke the original or if you want to use a diferent male to avoid using an adapter.,positive
"This item did not work for both an LED monitor or for my desktop PC.  For the price, i'm just going to throw it away.  Although the plug has the right shape, it fits loosly in the socket of the device.",negative
"Good quality, Its sort of hard to write allot about a cable but I would buy this one again.Thanks JP",positive
"Works just like any power cord should, no issues at all, bought as a replacement for one that was ran over with a sweeper.",positive
"Does what it says, says what it does. You'd have to work to screw up a power cord IMO though...",positive
I needed this cord to supply a desktop with AC voltage. It works perfectly. I have no complaints with it.,positive
"Works like it should, and cheap as well. Worth it in my opinion, and I definitely recommend it if you need a power cord.",positive
"I don't know what else to say about this product, but it's exactly what I expected and works for me. I'm glad I could find one at this price. Any electronic store would sell this for $18",positive
"Good snug fit on both ends. No overheating of cord with my computer hard drive and screen...works perfectly. Good sized cord, which is average for 6 foot cord length. (Had lost my 2 previous cords). Belkin makes a good product.",positive
This is the power cable I needed to use with my Desktop PC and it worked wonderfully. The fit on both ends was snug and secure. I didn't experience any loose connections that others have mentioned at all. It plugged into my power supply with just the right amount of force and it will never detach itself unintentionally. PC powered up immediately on first try - which really doesn't need to be said...The bonus - it's really cheap!,positive
"Looks nice, considering it's a cable. It works well too. My only issue is that I find it a bit short, It is the correct size but for my preferences 6 feet isn't that big for cables in general. Regardless, did it's job well. I am satisfied with it. Bought 2",positive
"Had enough to make it possible to get this well-priced cord. Very happy with it; Belkin makes a good line of products, at least so far as I've found.",positive
Well known make to me always rated. Used a few times and no issues yet. Hopefully will last a number of years.,positive
This is what I used to replace my monitor power cable that I also lost.  This way I was able to turn on my monitor.,positive
"Belkin is a good brand, so I did not hesitate in purchasing this power cord. Anyway, there is not much science in a power cord. This one fit perfectly.",positive
This is one of those products that either works or it does.  In my case it worked.  I used it to power a CRT monitor.,positive
Product came in Belkin packaging and was the same quality as power cords that come with computers and printers.  Worked perfectly with my LCD TV.,positive
"It works, it's long, it's tough, it's high quality material, my chiwawa is not going to be chewing through this. If your looking for a power cord that just does its job, then get this one. You can't find a better AC Adapter Power Cord.",positive
This is a basic pc cable it works on most computers and monitors and some printers. This is way cheaper here than in Walmart or another store so if you can wait for it in the mail do it will save you some extra $$$,positive
I needed a power cord for a Cisco switch I bought recently. This cord was cheap and got the job done. I'll be buying another one if I ever need it. I used to have a ton of these lying around and got rid of them. Isn't that the way it always is? :),positive
"This thing is more then up to the task. This is as good as the cord that come with any computer, printer, or TV. It's a great replacement part for a good price.",positive
I recently acquired an old desktop from a friend that didn't come with a power cord. This arrived quickly and works well (at least for the week or so that I have been using it). I don't foresee any problems.,positive
"Nothing special here, we needed a few spare power cables for some PC's and Monitors that went missing and these fit the bill perfectly.  No issues, cheap, and work great for various 23&#34; LCD's and XPS 8700 Dell systems.",positive
"Exactly what I needed to get my LCD monitor working again. For buyers, this is interchangeable with many desktop computers and other monitors, so buy it with confidence.",positive
"We bought a couple of these to replace our cords to our monitors because we had European cords...anyways, these are just as good quality as the originals and dirt cheap here on Amazon, so it was a no brainer. Perfect.",positive
bought it to use as an extender but it wasnt for that and even so I kept it because it will be used for something,neutral
This cord is amazing. It feels great and fits into most monitors. It is also made by Belkin which means a lifetime warranty and quality product. And its cheap!,positive
Extension Cord was needed to make my Computer monitor stretch farther to my Desktop unit. Fast shipping and works great. No problems after 6 months.,positive
"These work great when chaining lighting and speakers. I found these in red, blue, and yellow on Amazon, they are different colors and legnths. I wish they made 10-15ft in colors. That would be great. Having the color allows you to know how long you're grabbing!",positive
Simple need and this product delivered.  Great quality too and very heavy duty.  Connections are solid with no worry of accidental disconnect.,positive
Some Belkin branded products are overpriced imho but this Cable in particular is a steal.Hard to find in stores and if you do find it expect to pay 2-3 times the price.,positive
Choose this product from a reputable mfg. to try and extend my computer reach before making a permanent installation in my home.,positive
"It's an ethernet cable.  It's fifty feet long.  It works.Need more?  Well, I like that the plastic molding at the connectors doesn't slide down the cable.Still need more?  Buy it if you need it.",positive
"It is an ethernet cable. What is there to be said? It is cheap, and it works fine.",positive
It fits. It works. It was priced right. I bought it. What more can I say about it? Still need 2 more words... sheesh...,positive
"Great value if you just need a regular 50 ft. ethernet cable, and you don't care about the color, etc.",positive
"I saw the same exact cable at best-rip off (oh I mean bestbuy) and it was 40 bucks more.  Buy here, be confident, the wire is just as quality than the one you'll get at best buy.  Im am extremely happy with this deal. I paid 12 bucks for a 40+ cable, doesnt get better than that.",positive
This is a great buy if you need to run the wire from one room to another.  The brand is good and the quality is there.,positive
"Cable was delivered promptly, product was as described.  Used it to connect a second computer to a router ... connections worked with no problems.  Connector ends appear to be sturdy  enough that I have no concerns about connecting and disconnecting this cable over time.  Considering the price, this is a good value.",positive
What can I say?? It was a great price on a 50 ft network cable and it works great!! Will buy again if needed.,positive
The cable is of good quality and had worked without problem.  The terminations are easy to plug in and remove.  There have been no performance issues with this cable.,positive
I received this item in record time I dont know How these guys do the item for such a low price. Why buy unknown makes names when you can get the real thing for less. Thank you and I will surely buy again and reccomend. Wish you every success.John,positive
"I have the tools needed to make my own Ethernet patch cables, but for $12, I opted to just buy this 50' cable and be done with it. The cable is high quality and the connectors are strong and molded in. So for less than 25 cents a foot, I have just what I needed.",positive
After receiving this cable I immediately plugged it into my router and my 360 and was up and running. Just what we neede for Xbox Live. Seems to be a high quality cable.,positive
"It's a cable, what does one say about a product like this. I wanted one and I now have it.",positive
"I have an old PC in the basement that runs as a file server; instead of buying a wireless card, I picked up this cable and ran it from my router up into the rafters and down into the front half of the basement - with cable to spare. It does just what it claims to do - gives you 50 feet of CAT 5e cabling glory. :)",positive
"This cable performed perfectly.  The data transmission speeds were every bit as fast as I had hoped, and the cable was not bothered by being in direct sunlight.",positive
"Its a 50' ethernet cable that I got for so low a price it bugged me for a bit... I got over it. This cable is well made and works as described.Now the SELLER, on the hand, was incredible! I got the item in three days brand new.",positive
There's nothing to it...The belkin network cable worked well right out the box. Its solid construction produces good signal conduction. So far I have used it to download firmware to my BD player. Great product. Worth every penny.,positive
The cable connected my computer with the blue ray dvd player to give me access to Netflix.  It worked flawlessly.,positive
"Don't go to Best Buy and pay that 200% mark-up. These cables are just as good, if not better. You won't be disappointed by the quality, and the length available here for a fraction of the retail price makes them a bargain.Frankly, the big box stores should be ashamed that they mark up items like this so much. The real quality and bargains are found online, with items like this one.",positive
I needed to connect a blu ray play to a wireless across the room. 50ft belkin cable worked out great for this task and now i get all my BD live stuff.,positive
I set this up and have been using it for a while now. Excellent quality and was able to run it throught the floor boards to my PS3 for a faster network connection.,positive
"A regular long ethernet cord that shows no signs of wear. However, it does not catch in ethernet slots (it sometimes slips out).",positive
"Belkin A3L791-S 50-Foot RJ45 CAT 5e Snagless Molded Patch Cable worked great for my computer, without any problems. We have a wireless Internet/connection in the house now, but I keep Belkin A3L791-S 50-Foot 5e Snagless Molded Patch Cable...",positive
What can one say about an ethernet cable? This is well made and works properly when plugged in. Reasonable value and I will order Belkin cables again,positive
"Rarely do you find such a good deal on such a typically overpriced commodity. Why should a simple cable that's used by billions of people be so unreasonably expense usually? Well, the answer is because they can get away from it. In this case I felt like I paid what I should pay. Good price and the product was everything I needed. Shippiing was pretty darned fast too. Recommended",positive
"THIS BELKIN QUALITY CAT5 IS WELL WORTH THE SUPER ALMOST REDICULOUS LOW PRICE.IF YOUR WIRED AND NEED LENGTH,THIS IS THE PRODUCT FOR YOU.EAT CROW RADIO SHACK!",positive
Not much to say- works as needed; cheap.Will buy again if need. Recommend.,positive
"I just needed it to work (connecting PS3 and router), and it does, 5 stars.",positive
"This is the 2nd time I've used Belkin Cat5's, I have some shorter ones and needed to change my router placement. I've also used Belkin HDMI cables and I think Fiber optic cable as well. I've never had any problem with their cables so far and their prices are reasonable...",positive
I like the snagless feature and easy coiling for storage of this cable. I get it out when using my portable in a wired network and then coil it up and stow it in the case.,positive
"Usually it's better than average,but this one is not as good as I bought before. I have quiet few Belkin's items and I like /trust this brand. Everything would be fine if not for the cheap plastic plugs ...If ur intend to unplug/re-plug it often, than I recommend other brand-Belkin screwed up on this one;) Thought it's cheap-don't like it-throw it in the garbage.;)))",positive
Some days it is better to just buy a good cable like this instead of putting your own ends on a bulk cable. Very reasonably priced and a quality product.,positive
This was exactly what I needed. Thanks for great product and great price. The product is sturdy and works well.,positive
I ordered this as a spare so I have not used it yet.  It does appear to be of good quality.,positive
"It works as I expect an item from Belkin to work. I needed a few extra cables to connect some home theater components to the switch box for the router, these do the job quite well.",positive
"Shipped immediately to me, this patch cable is worth way more than I paid. Very good quality.  Excellent customer service as well. Excellent Value and Product",positive
"These cables rock, I got a bunch for my dorm room, and they work perfectly and do what I need them to do.",positive
I am pleased at how well this cable works. I use it to hook up my XBOX to my router in order to get greater speeds for streaming video and it doesn't disappoint.,positive
I have no complaints pertaining to this cable.  I particularly like the molded connector feature.  It's always a personal fear of mine that my wires and cables will fail at the connector due to cheap construction.  I doubt that will be the case with this cable from Belkin.I also give kudos to the pricing.  I simply cannot argue with $3 for a 7 foot CAT5.,positive
Secure snug fit great colors price is definetly right!  Get what you order at your door with minimal time usually 2 days,positive
I bought this cable and it worked well.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for products sold by belkins.,positive
great quality cable . What I mean to say is it is well made and has decent insulation tonot disturb the flow of information between that and your modem.2nd Finally able to color match some of your cables so they actually add to the look of your rig or ambianceI would reccomendthese cables,positive
"Works very well! It has a nice length to it. For it to have been SO cheap, it really gets the job done. It doesn't fall in and out of the ethernet slot. It stays right in place.",positive
Don't care about color the cords are hidden. Just like the high priced store cables. Great packaging. Why go to BB when you can get these.,positive
"These Belkin network cables are well-made, and they do the job.  Of all the colors available, the gray is the least expensive, and blends in well.",positive
I got this cord for under $5 and it lasted almost a year before the plastic ends broke. I unplugged and replugged it in one or more time a day and was satisfied with it for how much abuse I put it through.,positive
What can I say- it's a CAT 5e cable and it works exactly as described- no problems. For people who can't deal with making our own cables- like me.,positive
This item worked as expected and the price was lower than other suppliers.  I have had no problems with this item thus far.,positive
"It's not the prettiest cable in the world, but it's well-made and it does what it's supposed to do. I can't really ask for more.",positive
Its a patch cable. I hooked my xbox and dvd player to my router and can now access the internet on both.,positive
I'm using the cable to connect a router to a desktop. It works fine,positive
Good quality cable. I used it to hook my HDTV to my router and have had no issues. Would buy again.,positive
The is an extremely cheap and one of the fastest commercial cables you can get. Totally worth the money. Look no where else.,positive
"this was just the right length, color, and price for us, came in retail packaging and works fine for us",positive
The quality of this cable from Belkin seems to be good. They fit my router and are easy to install and remove. I have had trouble with some Ethernet cables in the past so I bought 3 different sizes of Belkin  and they all worked great.I even tested the cable and it was fine. I'll definitely buy these again in the future.,positive
I used this cable to hook up my BluRay player to a Ethernet switch.  It was inexpensive and works great.  Would recommend it.,positive
I needed a few of these for various internet enabled bits of kit and a few of these did the job and weren't overpriced for what it is.  Works fine!,neutral
"Good enough price, nice ends, good sheathing.",positive
I returned it because the network adapter which I purchased in conjunction with your product didn't function well with my HDTV and my modem. I would have kept it had I had another use for it.,positive
"You can't beat the price, but if I were to buy one in the future, I would get a 10 or 15ft. I bought it for my bedroom and 7ft is pretty short to reach everywhere I want.",positive
"""Snag-resistent"" would be more accurate: a pair of flexible plastic ""ears"" guard the release lever that is the bane of normal CAT-5 cables, but those ears can bend down so that the lever is unprotected.  Otherwise, it's fine, and the price was right.  I will buy more of these when needed.",positive
"This cable was exactly what I needed, and the quality, price, and speed of shipment was terrific! The type of cable was the perfect speed, and complimented the rest of my system very well! All I can say is Thanks!!!!!",positive
What can you say about a patch cable?  I chose the Belkin product because I have used Belkin for many years with no failures of any of their products.  The products are reasonably prices and Belkin has always maintained a high level of quality.,positive
It's Cat 5 cable with an RJ-45 on each end.  What else is there to say?  It's portable and works.,positive
"What can I say, it's a ethernet cable, nothing special except for maybe the snagless ends. Cable is well-built from a reputable brand at an unbelievable price. Great connection, doesn't come loose from my router (or the wall). Also comes with a lifetime warranty so if anything goes wrong you're covered.",positive
Fast Ethernet cable built to last.  Bought this as an extra cable in case I needed it.  Works like a charm and is a great asset to have.  You can never have too many cables.,neutral
"Connects my PC, and my xbox to the internet. I cant think of anything negative to wright works well for what it is.",positive
"Good cable. It is nothing special, but does everything I need it to.",positive
"They sent a different product.  Does not say that is made by Belkin anywhere on it.  They sent me a RJ45 cable made by FOXXCONN #E204149.  This does not have the protected cover 'snagless' over the release lever, as shown in the picture/item description.  I'm not happy; I do not plan to buy from this company again.....",negative
Pros: Cheaper than any Brick and Mortar. Snagless design is nice. Let's me get on the interwebz.Cons: Hasn't made me a BLT. Belkin should incorporate this into their next CAT 5e design.TL;DR: Buy it,positive
"Cat 5e cables are Cat 5e cables, for the most part. But quality does show when you compare the lowest quality products to the highest ones. This cable has solid sheathing and well built ends which will probably last for many years even in somewhat abusive situations.",positive
"I got 5 of these cables in pink, since amazon was offering them as an add on item for a discounted price. I chose pink because it was less expensive than any other color by at least a dollar. So far they have been working perfectly, as most cables do.",positive
I needed cable for specific purpose and and specific length and color. This was perfect and I would recommend to everyone,positive
works great,positive
"7 feet, just to warn you all, unless you know for sure that the things you're connecting are gonna be close, could be a little tight, especially if you're going around a desk or something.Looking for cables? Go with Belkin, go with snagless. You'll save yourself a lot of grief.",positive
There were needed in my computer/TV setup.  They arrived on time.  And they seem sturdy and well made.  Note that they are a full 7-Feet long.,positive
Came on time as expected - thank you Amazon. Works as expected - thank you Belkin. What more is there ? Plug it in !,positive
Once you see the price of these in stores you will appreciate the great prices here. Ordered two of these and they work great and the snagless feature is a real plus. Ordered two more to keep for back up. The different colors are nice also for identifying different computers or whatever you are using.,positive
"It works and it's 7 foot long.  What more do you want from a 7 foot Ethernet cable.  Wifi is great, but there is no substitute for hard-wiring in when I am playing StarCraft II.",positive
"Not much to say about ethernet cables. I wanted a mix of different sizes as I rearranged my office, and it was easy to find on Amazon.com.",positive
Needed a shorter cable to hook things up around the TV to a router.  Cable is good quality and works perfectly fine.,positive
"They are inexpensive, flexible, and work just fine.  I'm just using them in mundane applications.  Don't know how they'd work in high speed applications.",positive
"It's a cable, it transfers data. Not much else to say about it. The price was right for the length that it was and connects my new desktop to the router.",positive
"Simple, made sturdy and hooks up my mac and PS 3.  Would recommend to anyone and inexpensive.  Great buy all around.",positive
It does what it's supposed to do...and well,positive
I cannot recognoze well how 7-foot long because I'm Japanese and the peoples other than US use metric unit. It doesn't wrok for my intension because too short!,negative
"Belkin products are usually a good bet.  This isn't complicated, it works fine and is what I expected it to be.",positive
Used the patch cord to connect my modem to a switch then from the switch to two Rokus.  Good price and fast shipment.,positive
"I'm so sick of most local stores overcharging for cables.  I always try to buy my cables online.  Sometimes you don't really know what you are getting though.  This one worked perfect and I would not hesitate to buy again.  Good cable, good price!",positive
"This Ethernet cable works great and is cheap!  I think this is a good size for most purposes.  It's not too long where it gets tangled up, but not so short you can't use it.  I like the way it latches in; this is a nice feature compared to other cables I own.",positive
"It's a good cable.  The only thing I would change on it is to make the snagless attachment more like what is on the Cables to Go 27150.  It's just a better design, but this one still does the job.",positive
"We bought two of these, basically because they were the cheapest 7 foot cable I could find on Amazon.  We've got other Belkin equipment, and have been happy with it.  But, to be honest I didn't expect much for that price.  I figured it would be cheaply made, toothpick size cable, or the end locks would break right away.  They were actually a pleasant surprise, especially for how cheap they were being sold.  Can't complain a bit.",positive
Great cable.No problems or issues.Does what it needs to do.Not expensive.I've bought many Belkin products with no complaints.,positive
"Great cord.  Does what it's advertised to do.  Can't beat the price and loved the color options, specifically the purple.",positive
"This cable was exactly what I needed, and delivered very quickly. No question that you will be happy with the purchase ... if you need a 7' cable.",positive
"I bought two of these to connect my TV and my surround receiver through an ethernet switch to my router. Plugged them in, everything worked (Netflix, internet radio) and never looked at them again. For that price you can't make them on your own.",positive
what you would expect from belkin.  these are high quality CAT5E cables and they work great to connect all my devices.,positive
"works great, the snagless head is good when you are pulling through areas so you don't snap the clip off the end.",positive
This is a standard cable and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I am happy with the purchase.,positive
"this cable works and is cheap. the tabs haven't broken off after extensive use, and the rubber shield covering that extends up onto them for the &#34;no snag&#34; feature might be responsible for that, though it seems to be decent quality plastic (not super brittle) on the connector too.",positive
"Bought the 7 ft gray cable: Good price, works as advertised. The snagless feature is good to have since I have broken the plastic latch on other cables in the past. Highly recommend.",positive
Good quality for your money. You don't have to spend more for a similar prodduct as this one. 5 stars.,positive
"Well, its simply a cable...not much really to say about it, other than it works and its size met my needs - having different colors helps, that was the major reason behind this purchase - various cables to same location (or even different locations I presume), all have different colors making identifying them easier when necessary (couple times now, removing cables, checking link lights, etc.). No problems since purchase though!",positive
its a cat 5 cable good quality and seems to work well is kind of short though make sure you measure the run that you will be using it for before buying,positive
It came on time and the cable works.,positive
"works as designed the price is just right . I will  recommend this item to my friend ,it works with the proper length.",positive
At this price its probably a knock off but it shows 100M across so I don't care.  I guess the snagless clips are pretty nice too.,positive
it works great..,positive
"Needed a couple of cables for a project I was working on and once again Amazon had the best price compared to most of my local merchants.  These worked, and are still working great for my application.  Thanks Amazon.",positive
"Ahhh its a network cable... Works as expected, would give it 10 stars if it could talk to me but since it cant 5 stars will have to do. LOL",positive
Does the job I got it for at a stellar price. No complaints. Buying from Amazon saved me money. I would have paid a lot more had I gone to Radio Shack or Best Buy.,positive
"This cable was exactly what I needed, and the quality, price, and speed of shipment was terrific! The type of cable was the perfect speed, and complimented the rest of my system very well.",positive
"I bought these because they are purple.  Good quality cables for a good price.  Really though, they are purple, and that's why I bought them.",positive
"The cable works as advertised. The connection is fast, and gives me no reason to be dissatisfied. A cable at this price cannot be beaten.",positive
"What can you say, it is a CAT5 cable, has quality molded connectors, works, and was cheap. I carry 2-3 with me on trips to plug into the connections at my hotel in various lengths, and Belkin always delivers with quality cables.",positive
This cable came at a good price and works flawlessly. I used it to increase my download speed by using the ethernet connection instead of the much-slower wireless. What more can you ask for?,positive
Works beautifully.  Now I get to sit back and bask in the glory that is fast internet service from my modem to my router.,positive
You could have paid much more money for the exact same cable. This cable works as well as one you might pay two to three times the price. Recommend the product and the vendor.,positive
Works great... it is just ethernet cable.  nothing special but perfectly fine as long as reasonably priced.  Seems to be well built and solid.,positive
I bought them to replace the ones I have in use that have broken clips. Next time I pull my computer mess err desk apart I will replace them.,positive
It's cable. It works. It wasn't expensive. Why do I need so many words for such a simple review? One more  word argh,positive
It's ethernet cable. It's the right size. And it didn't cost an arm and a leg. The connections are well made. Would buy again.,positive
"Bought these to connect my router to all my home theater stuff. Rasberry pi, etc. Love the vibrant off beat colors.",positive
its a jumper. cant say much more than that. works. nice quality. went from switch to internet ready device. ok.,positive
"I'm guessing the ""snagless"" refers to the tall curves on either side of the clip on the ends of the cable. These tall tabs on both sides of the clip make it rather difficult to push the clip down when removing the cable, at least in tight places where you're limited in how you can twist your hand. Meh, no big deal. The price is good, the black looks really darn good, and they do their job just fine!",positive
It does what it's supposed to do and it does it well. Fits perfectly and the casing is high quality.,positive
"I bought this to link my cable router to my bluray player for streaming video.  Works great, seems to be a high quality cable.",positive
The cable did it's job. It arrived on time and was as expected. I needed a CAT 5 cable to hook another PC to my network,positive
It is nice having a 7 foot cable as opposed to the usual 6 foot. It worked out perfect with how I routed the cable to the PS3. Looking forward to more great shopping on Amazon.,positive
"Fast shipping and this is a good quality item. Simple to install, does what it is designed to do with no complications!",positive
"Ya, this thing is pretty cool. I bought it to connect one electronic thing to another and to my surprise, it worked! Data is being transmitted as I type this thanks to this cord.",positive
After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.,positive
"Use it with my new docis 3 modem and wireless router, works like a charm, gives me great speeds. Does exactly what it's advertised to do.",positive
"I'm not sure there's a whole lot you can say about network leads, but I'll try anyway:* It worked* the covering on the cable wasn't cracked anywhere* The RJ45 connectors were intact and undamaged* I liked the grey, it really brought my room togetherYeah, that's about all folks.",positive
Middle of no where. my wireless card went out. At that time I did not even know what an Ethernet cable was. However it got me up and going. With simple instructions off of YouTube,positive
There is not much to say about cable it works or not this 5e cable worked for my purpose it delivers my full Broadband speed of 300mbps to my devices,positive
Basic wire. Works. Too pricy for a basic part made up of wiring and plastic. Not much more to say.,positive
"The price on these cables is great.  So much cheaper than most stores, and they come in many colors so that you can use multiples.  Packaging is easy to use, and completely frustration free.  Would buy again.",positive
Then why do you have to spend 200% more for it in a store than online.  GREAT quality and price.,positive
Yet another example of Belkin getting it Right! This is not a unique length-it's the right length. Printers or other devices that are not immediately adjacent to all the other equipment need this length. Another great product at a good price by Belkin.,positive
I bought this and plugged it in and have been using it without issues ever since. I'd buy this again.,positive
"What more can I say than it works and was inexpensive!  I generally get my cables from monoprice, but this is good, too.",positive
"No issues with this cable at all. The ends hold firm in my switch, and have survived about a half dozen unpluggings/repluggings. The molding around the plug is strong and the cables flexible. Will buy again if need more",positive
the product just works just fine. One thing you'll notice about quality ethernet cables is where the insulation stops on the ends of the cable. If you're cable is filled with the plastic on the ends(like this one) you're getting a pretty good quality cable.,positive
"Exceeded the use for what  I needed .... Very good cord for the price .... The &#34;5e&#34; is for extra heavy duty wire gauge.Hooks up in a snap and doesn't come out of the plug unless you need it to...... The end plug is made with very good quality.... Thanks for sending it to me the way you did,  I received it one day before the promised date...",positive
Good wire to connect my ROKU to router. It enhances the speed as it is fast as compared to wireless connection,positive
I bought this product after doing a lot of price comparisons and reading reviews. I am satisfied with it. The cable is of good quality. I use it to connect my wired Trendnet Broadband router to my laptops.,positive
Not much to review here.  They were inexpensive CAT 5e patch cables.  They work just fine.  Construction was fine.  I would have no problem buying these again if I needed more patch cables.,positive
These arrived in good condition. They have worked fine for my needs. It's a pretty straight forward product and I think Belkin does a nice job with it.,neutral
Seems to work fine and quality is comparable to products from electronics stores.  This was half the price so that makes it a great bargain.,positive
This cable does what it is supposed to do. It works! What more can be said? It is well made and performs to specs.,positive
They worked fine and are well made. It's a cable but now I have to add 13 more words - there!,positive
"Needed this for my computer and it works just as I need it too. Nothing more, nothing less. Would suggest to anyone with a computer.",positive
The snagless part is really nice. Most any problems I've ever had end up being broken ends and this type seems to solve that problem.,positive
It's hard to review products that work as expected.  A 7 foot cable for less than $3 can't be a bad deal anyway.  This works as expected and was very inexpensive.  Grateful!,positive
"I love the price and free shipping with prime, this cable was a great buy and if i ever need another cable I will buy this one, I love the different ranges in length also. all around 5 stars on this product",positive
These are well made cables with good features such as the molded guard for the release lever to keep it from catching when the cable is pulled back out of an  installation.,positive
"This cable did what it was supposed to do, and was a great price.  I did recently upgrade all of my cables, including this one, but not for any reason in particular.",neutral
"I actually ordered this Belkin Ethernet cable for it's certified status and did receive a new (packaged) Belkin Ethernet cable. Plus, the price was the lowest I've found for this brand name cable. Of course, it's working fine. It's manufacture and durability appear among the best. Don't get me wrong, I use and am happy with the generics too...only difference seems to be the thicker construction of this Belkin brand. I expect unparalleled performance and longevity from this cable.",positive
"It is as advertised and works extremely well. Construction is above the standard. Before there all gone &#34;Get One, NOW!&#34;",positive
Good Network Cable. It looks reliable and made of good quality plastic.I wish I got a longer one though.,positive
"What can I say? It does what it's supposed to. No drama. For applications requiring a cable more than 3 feet, but less than 12. You know that, but I needed the extra words to fulfill review guidelines.",positive
"I love purple and this is really purple.The cord is good quality and I am happy, have gotten a few more since.",positive
"They work just like they should.Always go for the snag-free design, so the little clippy thing doesn't break off due to your carelessness.",positive
"I don't no if their is much to say about a Ethernet cable, but it feels like it has a solid build qualities. I have had no problem with the cable. I would recommend this item to anyone.",positive
This is a quality product at a great price. Works like a charm. Should last for a very long time,positive
"Does what it is supposed to do, with no snagging among cabling. Quality product with sturdy construction and flexibility, and a nice gray color.",positive
Belkin 7-Feet CAT5e Snagless Patch Cable (Gray) arrived before the due date and it was pachaged well. I sure like the color issue. All my cables are colored and I log them in a note book for easy access.,positive
I like the snagless connection feature.  Otherwise it's your basic Belkin Ethernet cable for home or office networks.  It's good.,positive
"I really like the 'snagless' feature on this one. I've broken off so many of the little clips on other ethernet cables. I think this will be much better protected. The length is good. I can sit in an easy chair near my desk with the laptop, and the cord reaches, but it's not so long to be cumbersome when I'm working on the desk.",positive
I have used this product on multiple devices and some of them dont seem to hold together as well as others.,neutral
"It's a CAT 5 cable, you use it for networking. There isn't much to say besides that I suppose, but it's very good for the low price.",positive
"There is nothing bad to say about this cable.  I bought three at once.  They aren't the exact ones shown in the picture, or at least, the ends look different, but they still have the ""snagless"" design, albeit a slightly different one.  Still works just fine as far as functioning as an ethernet cable.  I used it with my TrendNet ethernet switch, with no issues yet whatsoever.",positive
It's ethernet.. as advertised. Snag protectors work well. No complaints here; would buy again. 6 more words required required required.,positive
"Great Cable.  This cable is very rugged to use, the tab protectors are great since is really protects the tab.",positive
Snagless cables at an affordable price. Just what I needed. The connector head was solid and felt like it had a good build quality.,positive
"It's hard to go wrong with a Belkin product.  They always do what they're supposed to do and for a reasonable price.  It's hard to be too picky about a cable that plugs into your modem and computer, but it does seem to stay un-kinked.",positive
"No complaints about this cable. Functions perfectly, and is exactly as described. Used for connecting desktop computer to an ethernet switch.",positive
it is a great cable and easy to tell witch one goes where i highley recomend it to everyone it will not snag on anything,positive
"Exactly as advertised and shown. Nice quality, ""snag-free"" (meaning it has a molded ridge on the cable end to help try to avoid snagging the port clip), and fully molded (not crimped) cables. A good buy, especially with Prime shipping.",positive
I bought several (five) of these so my network cables would match and each of them work perfectly as expected.,positive
What can you say? It works perfectly and is of high qulity.,positive
"there's not a lot to say about this cable but I've got to try since there's a minimum word requirement for this review - the cable is good, its the right length, it works.",positive
always go cheap for digital cables. i found this same cable at Wal-mart for ten times the price. no difference what so ever.,positive
This is a nice cable with dual ears to protect the tabs from breaking. They work like they should which is good. They are a little pricey for what they are. Also note that the color is not the same as in the picture. These are light gray in color not Dark Gray.,neutral
I brought this cable when my old cable broke. I'm use it to connect my computer and wireless route together. It's a good cable.,positive
It was really cheap and shipped quickly. Not too much that you can say about a cable except that it works. I needed a second one and this one did the trick.,positive
"Hey, it's just a CAT5e cable and it seems to work as intended.  I didn't test it to see if it would work at Gigabit speeds (which a CAT5e should) but it works fine to connect my network-attached color laser printer to a local Ethernet switch.",positive
"I got this cable to connect my laptop to the internet occasionally as the wi-fi is pretty bad.The wire didnt look or feel like new and out of the box.I saw that there were bends and it felt cheap.I was going to return it, but it gets the job done and has no loss of speed.So for the price there are not a lot of complaints.",neutral
"New, does the job and arrived on time. Why would you pay two or three times more at an electonics store? Amozon is the place for all your cable needs.",positive
Just what they siad it would be and it works just fine. The color helps to see which item is pluged into which port.,positive
"Solid, well built product.  Does the job.Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.  Hate word length requirement when a few simple ones will do.",positive
Very good quality cable for a good price. I bought this for my desktop computer and they work great. The clip is not flimsy like most cables.,positive
"I have a HTPC and even though its rare sometimes I do need to use a keyboard with it.  I had a large print keyboard that is so easy to see in a not so brightly lit TV viewing area that I wanted to use.  Got this cable and routed it from the PC, around the back of the TV, and that puts the keyboard at a comfortable location for typing on.",positive
I needed to work on an old computer and needed more PS2 link.  Works as expected as an extension cable.,positive
"Needed to extend keyboard for older style desk. Six feet was clean, simple, and perfect fit. Cable flexible enough to move well without being so stiff it hangs up.",positive
This was a must have for my windows 95 keyboard! I enjoy the classic keyboards and this made it that much easier to use!,positive
great cable.  works great and was plenty long enough for my purposes.  Belkin is a great brand for this kind of stuff too,positive
This is just an extension cable to be used for a keyboard.  Most keyboards today have very short cables and this fixed the problem.  You may want to tape the two cables together with electrical tape to prevent them from pulling apart but mine had not pulled out so far.,positive
"I needed this for my old computer, which I use when I want to pretend it's still the 90s. I had a slight fear that the extra length - my keyboard's already long cable plus this one - would cause problems with the strength of the signal, but everything's fine. And how sweet it is to finally be able to sit at my desk, far from that computer, without a keyboard cable stretched across my monitor screen.",positive
"This extension fits into my older PC's PS/2 port better than the cable from the keyboard! The connection is snug, but not too tight. It works just as well on my new self-built Win 8 computer. I've got an old keyboard that is really great, so I'm using it alternately for both computers.",positive
"Work as they are supposed to. I sit about 5 or 6 feet away from my monitor, so these are perfect. I go through to many batteries in wireless keyboards and mouse's, so this has saved me tons.",positive
"If you want a longer cord on an older non-usb keyboard, this extension cable works great.Keyboard plugs into it snugly and wont fall out easily while moving it around or lightly tugging on it.",positive
"It's Belkin. What more to say? Nice tight connections and it works. Probably will have only wireless mice soon, but this was handy when I needed it and it didn't give me any problems.",positive
I have two of these connected together to extend my keyboard from the computer.  I would definitely purchase again. Thanks.,positive
"I use this to connect an old PS/2 keyboard to my HTPC, and it works fine. I bought this to replace a generic brand that wore out, so hopefully this name brand will be better.",positive
"The configuration of my office made it impossible for my cpu and monitor to be close enough together to use the existing cables. So, I purchased these extension cables and they work beautifully. They were the exact same product as sold in stores for 3 times the cost and there is no loss of function. I would recommend this product to others needing just a little more length in those cables.",positive
"don't quite understand what I need to say about this product, it's an extension cord, it extends the distance between the motherboard and the keyboard and/or mouse.",positive
and it's screw handles are ribbed and very easy to grasp.Nicely constructed.,positive
Well built. Thumb screws are very ergonomic. I use these cables with standard external modems like the USRobotics 56K faxmodems. Good value for the money.,positive
What more can you say. It works like expected. The cable didn't appear to be cheaply made and all hardware interfaced using the cable worked perfectly.,positive
This is a decent cable for the price.  The connection of the cable to the connector is rugged and will resist breaking easily.  Cable is well insulated and connectors are of typical Belkin quality.  Have used this in several environments including in the lab setting with satisfactory performance.,positive
"Just what I needed to allow my users to connect to our CNC machines from their laptops.  Great price, I couldn't make them for this price.",positive
"This is basically just a DE-9 to DB-25 adapter. It has the normal RS-232 specified pinouts on both ends, so it should work with almost anything. It will not work with things that use a proprietary pinout, such as point of sale (POS) machines. We use these for factory hardware and label printers.",positive
"I installed these in my garage and am very pleased with the sound and clarity.  A salesman at a big box chain electronics store tried to talk me out of them, but for $30.00, you just can't beat these speakers.  They are easy to set up.  Anyone looking for an inexpensive speaker for a garage, patio or for a secondary stereo system would be very happy with them.",positive
"I bought these speakers for less than $20 and am very impressed with their quality. I put them on our patio and the entire area is filled with great sound (the patio is about 15'x30'). If you are looking for an inexpensive set of speakers for outside, this is your pair.",positive
I bought these speakers to use on our deck and also to point out at our pool.  I am amazed at the sound quality for such a small box.  If you are looking for an inexpensive set of speakers to place outdoors then these are a perfect fit.  I am going to order a second pair in order to increase my coverage area.,positive
These speakers sounded great but I do like to crank up the occasional KISS or VanHalen and these speakers just stopped working. I've never blown a speaker before but I guess that's what happened.,negative
"to me, Kensington is a name that project 'trust'.  this was priced right and works great.  good cord length.",positive
"I love this!  It comes with matching tags.  We always have a mess of cords over by our tv.  Between all the components it is iimpossible to tell what is what...not anymore.  You just tag it with the matching color, up by where you plug it in.  I love this, and it comes with a great warranty, which also sold me.  Worth the little bit extra, IMO,",positive
"I have these all over in my house!  They work great!  I had one for many years that I paid over $50 for but I got my money's worth for sure!  So when I was able to see these on Amazon for less money, I was happy!  They work well, they allow you to plug up many things and move freely.  The cord from the power strip is average length but it does the job!  I would recommend.",positive
"Purchased six of these for use in our store. They are durable, with an 8 foot grounded cord.Amazon's 2005 product description indicates 1260 joules protection - 2010 model has 520 joules @ 330 clamping volts.Will certainly purchase Kensington surges again.",positive
"This is a great power strip.  I use it in my office and there is enough room between each plug that it doesn't matter how big the plug next to it is, it does not interfere.I also really enjoy the design and colors.  Having a quality item that also looks great it just an extra plus in my book!",positive
This surge protector is super cute and can handle your tv and other big items. I bought two of these just because it's awesome looking. lmao,positive
This is a brilliant product. It's so helpful to not have to tug and pull and guess which cord is which. I love that they added tape so you just put matching tape on each end of the cord and pull the cord into the coordinating plug.,positive
I got this strip because I was living in a mobile home and wanted to protect against surges on my computer. This did just that.,positive
"For the price, and the brand name, Motorola's FRS radios should be more durable - these don't last long in average use (either business use by IT professionals, or the real torture test, with pre-teen boys).",neutral
Fabulous product - works great - highly recommend - have used on my friends boat and it is great when we are on shore and need some one to come retrieve us - also works great on the boat that is 168 feet long,positive
"this thing is now just a blue brick in the corner of my room. i tried to download the driver from a website but no such website exists. i could download it from the from pirate bay, but that's illegal and unsafe. so i have all these pictures of dear family members (some of them are dead), and i can't retrieve them!",negative
Best buy.  Excellent quality.  Thinest case around.,positive
This is a nice case.  Bought it for my dad's M515 and out of the box it didn't fit because the stylus insert is too large for the accessory slide but he was able to modify the case so that it does fit.  He likes it!,positive
"This is a decent case for carrying your PalmPilot.  A lightweight metallic case with hinges might be better.  Actually, I don't know anybody that carries this device and I haven't for 10 years, but the case was good.",positive
"I have used this case for almost 7 months and still having difficulties when trying to put it in my shirt pocket.Forget about putting some credit cards in it, because it gets thickerI gives a lot of protection for the Palm, but it affects the best characteristic: SIZEI have been alternating this case with the original cover, depending the ocassion and the clothes I'm going to wear (in order to carry it in a comfortable and practical way)",neutral
The quality of the product is excellent except that it serves as a big impediment for when you charge on the Palm cradle.This won't fit inside the Palm Cradle.,neutral
"Nice looking, good feel. But my rail pulled off the rubber binding after 6 months of light use.",negative
"I bought my first ZIP drive (parallel port) a long time ago, and replaced it with a USB/AC-adapter model a while later. I am still using it, and it works. The disks have a higher failure rate than the drive, but hey-still working after all these years.",positive
"I bought this to read some old Zip disks I had lying around. I wanted to save the old files. I bought my Zip drive from third-party seller ElizabethLeeHR and even though it was used, it ran on my Win7 laptop flawlessly. No driver needed; pure plug-n-play! Of course, Zip drives eventually all develop the click-death syndrome, so I can only rate this 4 stars!",positive
"Mine's been working flawlessly since I bought it in early 2000. I understand the newer models are bus-powered. If for some reason you can't have a power strip, that's a concern, but I do wish the AC adapter was smaller.Gotta love the way it shoots non-Iomega zip disks half way across the room, too!I recommend this drive for low-cost, low demand storage and backup. Now if only zips would come down in price...",positive
"I had backed up a legacy computer on ZIP disks and stored them away.  (I now use thumb drives and CD-ROM.)  When I needed some old material from the old computer, I could not read the ZIP disks without getting a new drive.  This convenient USB ZIP drive was just what I needed.  It was shipped promptly and in excellent condition.  It saved my life on this occasion.",positive
My zip drive finally went out. It worked for at least ten years. Current USB drives have more capacity and are a lot cheaper.  One can buy a 128MB USB drive for $2.99 dlls!!,positive
I purchased a zip to keep from loosing files...if system crashed...not realizing the zip would stop working first. Found a refurbished more updated with usb and I am in heaven.  Now I can travel with it....,positive
"Item was delivered on time and in good condition.  All the essential parts were in the package (Power cord, and USB cable).The ZIP drive works great.  I'm very satisfied with the product.",positive
"Since I was out of internal bays and I still needed a Zip drive for my PC, I purchased the Portable USB model and it has worked just fine.  No glitches in either the installation or operation.  I don't quite get the  translucent blue case (oh yeah, it works with the Mac, too) but other than  that, no complaints.  Now that is high praise, indeed, these days!",positive
"I plugged this adapter into my new Dell Laptop and it brought up my CompactFlash card as an additional hard drive in Windows 2000, no software or additional drivers required.I was then able to browse and even edit pictures on the card as if it were a disk drive. Truly amazing. All peripherals should be this easy to install and intuitive to use.",positive
I use a viking 128Mb CompactFlash card in my Canon S200 digital camera. Simply plugging the card into this reader and the reader into the PCMCIA slot on my Mac TiBook automatically launches iPhoto and imports the contents of the card into the laptop. Much faster and certainly more elegant than carrying around cables and using the camera battery.  Highly recommended!,positive
"Adapter works fine -- laptop is 5 years old, but everything worked fine.  Good price at Amazon.",positive
"This adapter works great for quickly moving digital images from cameras to your pc.  The only problem I have with it relates to the overall length of the card.  They should have made it 1/2 inch longer so you could remove it more easily from the PC card slot.  When inserted, it is &quot;flush&quot; with the PC.",positive
"It does what is says it does, the only downside I can think of is, that it does not have an eject button for the CF Card, so when the card fits tight, you have to remove the PCMCIA Card to actually get the CF card out.",positive
"This device was the second wind my old Panasonic digital camera needed. I connect the camera to the laptop with a serial cable wich makes it to slow (No USB cable), so I tried this inexpensive alternative in order to revive my old camera wich still works perfectly. I needed a way to download the pictures from the CF card to the computer. Now, I can download in seconds what usually took hours.",positive
"This Compact Flash Adapter work's great. All you do is snap you compact flash card into it and slap it into your Slot and bam! It is also much faster for me then hooking up my Digital camera to the computer using a USB cord and AC/DC adapter (saves on batteries). Faster in the hook up time and faster in downloading and uploading. I can highly recommend this product, I am very happy with it.",positive
I use it with my IBM Thinkpad to download pictures from a Nikon Coolpix 5000 with a 512MB CF card. This adapter works great. Plugged it in and WinXP automatically recognized it as E drive. This adapter worked in Win2000 and Win98 as well. Great price and buying it new is actually cheaper than used!,positive
"This is a fabulous device for transferring large volume of data from my handheld (Jornada 548) to my laptop, and vice-versa.",positive
This is a very high quality leather case with good hardware.  My laptop fits well and it has a place for almost everything.  The almost is a limited amount of space to carry the computer power supply and cords.  There isn't a pocket deep enough to carry those items without causing the outside to bulge.  The velcro flap fastners are noisey and overdone.  A few snaps would have been much better.  Other than that the quality is first rate.,positive
Product shipped fast and looks exactly as it did in the photo. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.,positive
"There are better cases on the market, but I couldn't find one close to the price of this one.  Holds the PC snuggly, and there is lots of gadget space.  Great deal.",positive
Looks nice. Only complaint is if moderately packed it is hard to close. Good for the light traveler.,neutral
"I got one of these before and they are really good.  I was going to get one at Staples but it was $32.  I paid $10 less for the same product, that is a good deal to me.",positive
When will Amazon wise up and allow NO stars for a rating?This is so cheaply made it is worthless.  The battery compartment is &#34;held in place&#34; by a tiny plastic bar.  Broke almost immediately on my unit making the thing totally useless; with out the battery compartment locked in place it simply doesn't work.  They might as well have made the cable out of a piece of string!Don't waste your money,negative
Great lock for the price.  If you need a low cost lock to defend against amateur thieves than this is the lock for you.,positive
"I bought a Defcon 1 PA 400U in 1998. It works perfectly x 13 years. It has no key, but works w a combination.I have just bought another for another computer.",positive
I needed three of these for field employees.Easy to set-up a memorable code and attach to the laptop.I would recommend!,positive
"I bought 25 of these for my work so we can lock down our laptops while at the client site.  The product is good, minus the fact you can only set the lock code once.  I already had a coworker forget his code after 1 day, so we had to scrap that lock.",positive
"Compares favorably with much more expensive cables. I actually don't use it for anti-theft, but as a safety wire to secure a ceiling mounted video projector, but I'm sure it works as a theft prevention devise as well. Fit the DEFCON connector and the price was right.",positive
For users that travels a lot 100% recomended most cases when you need leave your notebook in some conference room or room hotel.,neutral
"I don't know why there are so many negative reviews, I bought the combo lock and the key lock and they both work great for me.  I take them to starbucks all the time and no one touches my laptop.  This is a great BUY, WORTH YOUR MONEY",positive
"Like this key lock, as I always had problems with the combination locks. The length of this is not too long, and I did not have problems with chemical smells that some people have mentioned. I noticed that the review section for this product had people reviewing the combination lock. I had the combination version the combination changed and I had to pry it off my computer.",positive
I now have three of these and have to HIGHLY recommend this item.  I use it for my computer as well as for my tv center.,positive
"This surge protector works well and provides lots of outlets, more than I actually need for my equipment.  It does the job.",positive
Fits great under a small desk and plug is flat against the outlet saving more room. On Off switch in front also easily accessable. Fills need for smaller footprint surge arrest.,positive
"How much would you spend to protect your $... palm?  this case looks real good, and it fits your palm like a glove, adds very little additional weight and gives you the mental peace that your palm will be protected from about everything it could happen to it.  Leather may look more stylish, but they are also bulky. A great buy.",positive
"I too thought this case was a bit on the flimsy side, given its plastic + metal covering construction.  However, my Palm Vx has survived more than its share of bumps and drops with aplomb, and it's because of this case.  It opens easily, closes easily, and still fits in my pocket comfortably.  I'm confident the Palm's screen is protected with this case.  It's given great service for over a year now.",positive
Very nice. My Palm Vx fits in it & is Protected. It is also shiny,positive
This is a great item.  I tried three different 'soft' cases and always had a problem with the Palm coming on and beeping while it was in my pocket.  Give this baby FIVE STARS!The critism is WRONG.  A.  Can't use left  handed?  Sure you can.  Just put it in the left side!B.  Can't synch  while in the case?  You bet you can.  Just tilt the stand to the side.  No  problem.,positive
"I  purchased these rechargeable batteries for my daughter and myself. In the description it said twin pack AA batteries. So I ordered 2 packs and was billed for 2 pack shipping. But when I received the batteries, it was a for pack. So if I only received 1 pack of 4 batteries instead of a 2 twin pack of batteries. Why was I billed for 2 twin packs instead of just paying for 1 4 pack. Very confusing.",positive
these batteries are exactly what i expected (@1.3 Volts) and work well for any electronic device i put these in i plan on buying even more in the future this is a Great buy,positive
"I fully charged them, put them in my digital camera, and immediately got the &#34;low battery&#34; signal. Not made is US. I do not recommend them.",negative
really good deal for only 7 dollars. they came very quick and work like there supposed to. i got what i pad for and have no regrets.,positive
Why Case Logic discontinued these I'll never know.  Back in my DVD collecting days there were my chosen medium of storage and protection.,positive
"...I'm so dissappointed in CaseLogic for discontinuing the hard cases. They were great, a HARD cover with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside (that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center). Somebody could have sat on it and it would've been fine...",negative
It's not foolproof but makes a good inexpensive deterrent. It makes it harder for anyone to just grab and go. I hooked this up to a Mac Mini and a monitor.,positive
"Definitely worthwhile for equipment one wants to keep. I teach at an urban high school. It is amazing what some students will take. Ever since a student took my projector when I had a sub so I could attend a meeting, I lock as much down as possible. Interesting that the school district does not bother with locks.",positive
"I chose this because I had a monitor without a lock slot. It was almost impossible to find a lock with its own plates! This comes with 3 plastic discs and a tube of superglue.Good points: thick cable, discs stick well.Bad points: cable only works with discs (not lock slots) or holes it can pass through. I don't want to stick a disc to my computer, so I'm using my old lock for it.",positive
"Excellent lock! Kensington builds good stuff.Kensington Desktop Microsaver Universal Computer Key Lock and Cable Security System (64162)I ordered thru ANTOnline though, and I was delivered an ""open box"" which was missng some parts. I ended up going thru the complete dispute procedure to resolve the issue. ANTOnline did not respond. Amazon refunded my money - Nice job!",positive
"This will help give you a sense of security. I know from personal experience that you will have to take a hammer and chisel to these discs if you want them off. Wrap them around the desk and you are good. Easy and quick to install, smart design of the discs and the wire, just don't lose the key :)",positive
"Excellent! Just what I needed to secure a 32inch flatscreen TV. Of course it hasn't been put to the acid test yet, but install was easy enough and it seems solid enough.",positive
The parts that glue to the hardware are quite small compared to other brands. It really just takes a few minutes to install and then your hardware is secure from the evildoers who want to steal your RAM.,positive
"This product came as described and worked perfectly. I consider all factors when ordering, including quality, price and company reputation. This product passed all. I can recommend this to others.While it is not by any means foolproof I do feel better. The install was a breeze.",positive
"Just what I needed to protect my valuable stuff that I can't take with me.The security cable kits I bought didn't have good glue pads on the anchors, so I ordered more anchors and used the super-glue instead, with much better results.",positive
"Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.",positive
"This is exactly as I expected and as described. Simple to install. Sturdy &#34;module&#34; attachment via included Super Glue.  Cable is long enough for three items.  I ran mine through a large eye-screw in the wall to keep the systems from going anyplace.I suppose this item might deserve 5-stars - but, by necessity and function, it's not every attractive. Not really Kensington's fault on that.  But something ingenious would earn a 5th star :)",positive
I share a house and always wonder if something might happen. These add extra security. Locks are meant to keep honest people honest. Of course any really determined thief will get them off but at least these will slow them down and maybe make them look for any easier target.,positive
"Have a small home safe for documents and cash at home.  Wanted to create a deterrent to someone walking off with it.The outside of the small safe is plastic and the adhesive worked great on the case.  I now secure it to a fixed object and have some level of security.  Not many solutions out there for securing file safes to fixed object, that I could find.Great value, does the job.",positive
Great for securing computer equipment.  Currently I purchased this to use in a hospital and was exactly what I was looking for.,positive
"This is surprisingly the best power strip I ever had! I love it for many reasons, it's compact form, the color code system, I can fit all the chargers in without conflicting with each other!",positive
This multi-outlet has a long cord (16') so we were able to make a charging area for 6 devices (and their respective adapters of all shapes and sizes) quite far from the outlet.  The product also looks nice enough to have out in plain sight.,positive
Pros:* Heavy enough to stay where you put it.* Cord long enough to be useful.* More aesthetically pleasing than the long beige strips.Cons:* Octopus style wiring does not support most cord organization strategies.* Pricey.,positive
This is the only one of my many surge protectors that has a 16 foot cord and I find that to be so useful.  I have had it for over a year and it is my favorite not only because of the cord length but also the compact size which is nicely balanced and able to easily accommodate six uniquely sized charger plugs.  I like this Kensington model so much that I have just purchased another as a gift.,positive
"This is a nice looking and space saving 6 socket outlet. I replaced an old PowerSquid with this unit and it has worked as expected. I really like the color coded sockets and the circular design, which resulted in a smaller footprint.",positive
I love the round design on this.  The design allows for you to use big plug in adapters and not have it take up another outlet.  I use this in my office and it works well.,positive
This works perfectly for what I needed it for...it fits adaptors well and the circular shape is definitely welcomed verses just a strip.  This also has a long cord which is incredibly helpful!  Definitely a good buy!,positive
"Used it in team gathering/meeting areas to allow multiple users quick, table-top access to power. The round format is nice for a centralized location.",positive
"The current protection is good, the design is clever, and it feels much sturdier than my cheap-o power strips. But why does it cost $40??",positive
it is small enough to sit om my desk and large enough to hold all of my chargers  it eliminated the cord clutter on the desk and the colour code is fantastic and it is approved by ul and csa expensive but well worth it will recommed to my friends,positive
"With a new HP touchscreen computer, I also needed a minimal footprint surge protector - this really answered my need on a modestly sized desk top.  Thank you Kensington.",positive
"We recently placed this SmartSockets power strip under our conference room table.  It looks good and has plenty of room for some of those larger adapters.  We don't use or need the color coding, but it does add to the visual appeal of the unit in a professional setting.",positive
"The circular design saves desk space and the extra long cord is helpful in setting up in an office cubicle. There is central power button that turns off all the items plugged into the colorful base. The colors are not the same, so different appliances can be assigned a different color. Useful if you have to unplug on device to use in another room or location.",positive
I love this because of the sixteen foot cord.  So versatile in where you can use it.  Highly recommend to anyone!,positive
"This works well on a conference table, like for class sessions with multiple laptops. Will hold 6 of the larger powersupply type plugs if needed. These come in handy. Functional as well as attractive with the different colors. The color scheme allows instant identification of cables with stickers that come with it.",positive
"I bought this for use on my desktop. The shape makes it very convenient for use with power cords and the odd shaped transformer packs for cell phones, hard drives etc. The power switch on top is convenient if you want to shut it off to avoid wasting energy on the plugged in items when not in use. Nice long power cord, heavy base keeps it from moving around to much. Highly recommended.",positive
"I was skeptical about using the Palm, but once I started it quickly became indispensible.  I have eight large rolodex files on it plus tons of memos and 'to do' items.  The 2mbyte of memory is still handling it with no  problem.  .........GIVE IT FIVE STARS!",positive
"I can't believe this can still be reviewed.  I don't have much to say, but I have a few old contacts still on my ten year old Palm that I still havent transferred over.  I know.  The point is that my Palm sits in my drawer and always powers on perfectly.  I don't think I have even charged it in a few years.  This thing is amazing in its longevity.",positive
I have found a few places that will do memory upgrades for all the Palm's. 8M seems to be the max.,positive
"I was forced to buy the aluminum case for my P-V because the power would consistently come on while it was in my pocket.If you intend to carry this around as a pocket device, you'll be stuck with investing in a case...  beware.",positive
"Although the Palm V is more appealing than the III it's essentially the same technology. I've had one wear out and die, another just fail and &quot;reboot&quot; itself alot, another fail from getting a little wet. I  love these things but for me the extra $150 for the V translates into $175  per year vs $100 per year, assuming it lasts two years.",positive
"I love my Palm V!  I won it over the internet and now I don't leave home without it!  Very simple to use and EXTREMELY useful.  I store telephone numbers, my date book, grocery lists, myriads of other lists for work and home, and just yesterday I downloaded a trial copy of SplashPhoto that lets me show a slide show of family pictures on my Palm V.  A GREAT electronic toy!!!",positive
Great and slightly more sturdy version of the popular Palm. I like the metal casing. I hate the fact that when you put the unit in your shirt pocked it is very easy to create pressure on the buttons and pretty soon the device is scrolling and clicking away.,positive
perfect,positive
"I love these inserts.  I used to print on cardstock and cut out my own labels.  My lines never turned out straight and I always ended up with inserts that were too large or too small.  With these, I end up with a great looking label label that fits perfectly",positive
"In the product description, it might have been helpful to mention that the software isn't available for Mac....I'm going to attempt to figure out another way to get it done using these, but not sure if I'll be able to...",negative
"I needed to read the description better. However I feel I need to say that this paper is pretty much like a thicker printer paper, not really cardboard or glossy. And the printing comes out rather flat. of course I have used Memorex before, but have always used glossy before, so they make great products, but this one is pretty much of no use to me. But it's mainly my fault for not reading more carefully.",neutral
Fast delivery and great product,positive
Product does exactly what I need and the price works very well for me! Will keep on buying these for as long as I need to...,positive
ummm the paper is slightly thicker than regular paper. it never jammed my printer. it has perforated lines for folding but it didnt work out like that for my printer. maybe i aint doing something right but to gets the job done so whatever,positive
I'm slowly getting my program cd's into jewel cases and needed a way to label them.  I'm going far too slowly to try doing the labels on a computer and am hand-lettering them.  They fit well and do what I need to do.,positive
"These days, people seem to have forgotten what jewel cases are, but these inserts are a definite step up from the scissors and printer paper method. They don't look especially good or fit better than adequately, but they are better than....see above.",neutral
These labels are perfect for what they are supposed to do and are pre fit exactly to the space provided and are exactly what I was shopping for.,positive
I have tried an awful lot of CD inserts and these are by far the most cost effective and functional.  I just love them.,positive
"The template prints a little off and these are pretty much just pieces of cardstock paper, but for a cheap insert these are good. They tear off of the sheet easily and fit perfectly in jewel cases.",positive
"These are fine.  They are not glossy, but they are measured right and very good for home made covers of DVDs and CD's,  There were some whiny reviews, but remember they are not pro photo paper.  They work just fine though and look good.",positive
i will definitely be back to get more of these i like these because they are easy to work with.,positive
I have a recording studio so I make a lot of CD's. Most of my artists gives me the information they want on the CD & Jewel Case Insert & I do the rest. I hope Memorex never stops making these inserts & Amazon never stop carrying them. I go through several thousand a year.,positive
Purchased as a gift for daughter. She was very satisfied with quality and the colors to help her arrange her music by catagory.Good price and Great Seller...prompt ship.,positive
"Very easy to use and they fit very well. Good, cheap labels that work very well with my printer. Thanks!",positive
"The title of my review says it all. I am running a very old Jewel Case designsoftware program. Nevertheless, this product works perfectly and producesvery professional looking results.",positive
These labels are great for CD's and DVD's. The labels have perforations in the paper to give excellent neatness that gives your projects a professional look. Great for thin and thick media holders.,positive
These worked very well first time and every time so far on my printer. I'd been printing my inserts on 25-pound paper before so these are a vast improvement; the perforations make it easy to separate the parts.,positive
"I love the grade of the paper and ease of perforated edges makes it easy to insert and look ""pro""... you can find the templates online at the memorex referred website..I only wish they had a more professional grade Photo Paper, it would definitely be worth whatever extra cost.... even a 10 pack of paper! possibly a better ""economy"" template as well, so I don't waste so much of the 8 X10",positive
Software that you download is a little tricky but once you get used to it it works as it says.  Paper isn't the heaviest of card stock but that's ok.  Serves its purpose.  I would buy again.,positive
"I'm moderately comfortable with my PC's innards, but I'm no hardware guru. Therefore, I was extremely pleased when this card installed with the ease the documentation (and other Amazon reviewers) promised. The low price was icing on the cake.",positive
"Can't be any finer with how compatible it is, and how bullet proof they made these.  I'm glad that these were available still, they are prefect for 100Mbps network access.  I wish they would get into fiber at a systematic speed sheet.",positive
"Work well in Linux, 98, ME, NT and Win2K.  I use these cards and the Linksys PCI cards all over my network, both work great.",positive
"This NIC is very robust as it is easily installed in any Windows computer or even a Linux box.  Netgear's website is done very well, in which you can get tech support issues resolved quite easily.I never had to contact tech support due to any of their items that I have purchased.  Their web site support is superb.I highly recommend any of Netgear's products.",positive
This is a great hub. Work well. This is part of my first network that I installed myself. I used all Netgear compnents and I am pleased with the simplicity of the installation. Just plug and go. I do recommend the  Netgear FA310TX Nic's also.,positive
"I got this hub in the mail, plugged in the power, plugged it in to my DSL modem, plugged by PC and laptop into it, and everything just worked!  No configuration or anything (despite my DSL setup), basically no problems of any kind.  Can't beat that!",positive
"These days, there is almost never a reason to buy a hub...  For most applications, everyone should be buying a switch.I just bought for of these for our lab, because nothing beats a hub for allowing you to sniff network traffic when debugging network software.For someone wanting a REAL hub, the DS104 is a real hub!",positive
"My cable modem makes for great, fast internet access... for one computer. But what about downloading updates for my iBook without disconnecting my iMac? This hub has done that with ease. Easy to follow instructions had my home network up and running within ten minutes. Never a problem since.",positive
"For just a simple 10 Mbps hub, this is an excellent one for the price. It is compact and sturdy, especially with the metal casing. Link and status lights are handy along with the Normal/Uplink switch. No software installation needed - plug the power in and the CAT cables and you're all set!",positive
"A great hub that allows you to share an uplink onto another network with 3 computers or have a local network of 4 computers.  Either way, the hub has been very reliable and performance has been as promised.  Netgear is known for making quality Ethernet products and this is just another one of them.",positive
This sturdy case has outlasted many cameras and I find it adequate for carrying my camera around.,positive
"I bought this bag to use with my Olympus C-4000.  Based on what other reviewers wrote, I expected the bag the bag to be more compact than it is (I could fit two of my cameras in there).  Construction and compartments are excellent, and it's a great bag if you have a few accessories to carry.",positive
"ANd its rain resistant (got stuck in the rain at practice a few times), padded for drop protection and fits a boatload of stuff.  Got my gamboy on one side and my digicam on the other.  AA Batteries in the secret compartment, and money and stuff on the outside.",positive
"I own the Kodak DC3400 digital camera, and can't say enough about this case.  It has room for my battery charger, extra set of batteries, all PC cables, Kodak's software CD, and the manual that came with my camera.If your digital camera is similar in size to Kodak's DC3400, get this bag.  It's simply the best balance, between compact size - and having enough room for all your accessories.",positive
I ordered two and they came in the standard distribution box that stood up to thefreight carrier.Inside the carton was the two seperate retail sales boxes in premium shape.Units worked right out of the box once batteries were connected.Powerchute CD was original older version and the web had the updated 3.0 (2012).Stable angled plug with a very sturdy cord.,positive
"Had mine since December 1999 but noticed that the battery failed after about 3 years, like the other poster wrote, APC didn't list a replacement at first but now they do and I finally got around to replacing it.  Battery type is RBC2 for those wondering.Solid unit, having a telephone line/out and USB controller is a plus.",positive
"I have owned other sound blaster sound cards. I have found Creative Labs to be the best in the sound card industry. This sound card is to replace and older model.So for, the Sound blaster card is functioning well. I always consider Creative Labs sound cards for all of my sound needs.",positive
"I installed per instructions, beign always grounded with a wrist strap wired to live ground circuit.  When I turned on the computer it went crazy and burned out the motherboard.  Took it to local tech who said newly installed board was bad and caused the motherboard to short out.  Ruined computer!!!",negative
"i was actually pretty excited to get these, but when it arrived, it was defective. the monoculars didn't align, causing me to see double and 2 picture, not as one. also, there seemed to be a scratch of some sort on the right monocular. i tried to clean or blow it out to see if it was just an eye lash, but it never went away. i sent them back for a return.",negative
"This is a good binoculars. It is clear and light. Buy it only if you really need 16x magnification. At times, you will wish you didn't have so much of magnification. My next binoculars will be one with zoom !The carrying case is cheap-looking (so is the neck strap).",positive
"Bought this in 2004 and it going great. 16x50 is on the higher end and I would recommend a smaller one because slight shake in the hand makes the objet move a lot, otherwise eit is good.",positive
Binoculars are very powerful...the focus is simple and accurate.  Very pleased with the binocs and the price was terrific.,positive
"got these so I could use them for hunting and other spotting, little bulky, but good distance.  Comes with everything you need.",positive
"good product for the price i buyed for a gift , the owner says to love it.",positive
I purchased this binocs for a tiger safari in India and am amazed by the quality of this product. Certainly recommended and a great value for price. AAAAAAA plus quality.,positive
THE MODEM INSTALLED AND WAS CONFIGURED IN ABOUT 3 MINUTES FROM START TO FINISH. TIGER.DIRECT IS A GOOD SUPPLIER.,positive
The best Modem I've seen so far. Way better the USRobotics/3Com Modems. I have two and they work very nicely. It's the next modem I'de buy if I needed another one.,positive
"for the price this is really cool,  you will need to buy extra memory, but it works with free mp3 players to load. the headphones are ear type so get a real pair, otherwise this worked great",positive
"put all those stupid, fluffy descriptions aside because only 2 words are needed to describe these speakers - THEY ROCK!  Never thought I would pay so little for so much!",positive
"These are not big speakers, but they have big sound.  If you decide to get a pair, you have to listen to the song, &quot;I love big speakers&quot;.  This has some good bass, that will show you what the speakers can do.  AWESOME speakers.",positive
Nice headphones. No noise escapes the headphones to disturb others.  Got them for my daughter's keyboard.  She says the only negative is that they don't have much range of volume but still great for when you want to play  when others are trying to sleep or whatever.,positive
They are not exactly noise cancelling as I read in some of the reviews. You can hear the tv a little and the person watching the tv can hear a little bit of the music if it's loud. It does allow for the one practicing to hear their music well. For the price I'd say it's worth it if your child is always practicing the same time you need it to be quiet or the tv is on.,positive
"This headset is inexpensive, so don't expect a product you will have for years to come.  However it has good sound and the ear foam is denser than most low end product which makes it comfortable.",positive
"I purchased these headphones to go w/my electric piano and I am delighted w/them and so is my family!  Now I can practice as often as I want and not bother anyone,  Great sound and light on the head so no headaches and great price, very affordable!",positive
I  chose this item to go with my synthesizer.  It fits perfect and I can hear very clearly.  It appears to provide a surround sound.,positive
Got this for our student to practice whiteout any hassles.Decent material at the right price and it works!  Thank you Yamaha and Amazon!( but I'm still unhappy about needing to buy a power cord).,neutral
"Terrific for making adjustment in each individual EQ for vocals and instruments.  Can help each voice, and instrument, sound better.  Plus it gives the vocals a better monitor mix.",positive
"These inexpensive earphones provide adequate rendering of sound from TV, movies, etc.  However, in terms of comfort, they leave much to be desired.  The flat, hard plastic speaker enclosure is only covered by a thin, somewhat scratchy &#34;cloth&#34; material.  It provides inadequate cushioning of one's ears from the hard plastic of the speaker enclosures.  A cotton, or even a foam covering would be an improvement.",negative
"Well built good sound worth the price, can be used for short and long range applications, multiple plugs makes it versatile.",positive
These are light and inexpensive. Needed ones with this type of plug. Use it with a portable keyboard. Has a nice long cord. Didn't need a fancy stereo headset. The sound is good and they clamp well over my ears. Most of the fancier headphones start to fall off my ears even when tightening the head band to the max. Like the feather weight.,positive
"I bought two of these for my kids and they are awful. The picture quality is so low that only about 10% of the photos are worth keeping. And being for my young children, my standards are very low. I bought them almost as a toy, and STILL I'm severely disappointed. DO NOT BUY.",negative
"This speakers are great sounding little things for the computer.  If you are looking for a set of speakers with a subwoofer this is definately not a bad place to start.  I have two sets of them and have had no problems with them, and yes... They are loud.",positive
I got this from a yard sale. The cords are unwieldy. The bass is too strong and is not adjustable. Stay away from systems that do not have adjustable subwoofers.,negative
"This lightweight headset does the job, and the price is right. It's held up well for 4 months of daily use. The fact that it lightly hangs on the ear rather than fitting snugly took a couple days to get used to, but it's nice that it is so light.",positive
The mike wand is only 4 1/2 inches long.  Since I have 7 inches between my ear and mouth the mike did not get close enough and my voice was too low.  It was otherwise comfortable and I imagine it would be fine for a person  with a smaller face.,negative
I modded this to attach to my AD700X's. Perfect gaming headset now. I hear and speak with clarity now. Antlion ModMic broke and didn't feel like spending $50 plus on the 4.0. Bought the mic and  some mounting tape! Would recommend over and over!!!!,positive
"I bought this mic to put it on my Audio-Technica headphone AD700s, I knew cutting the plastic headband off if the microphone was garbage I'd just have to eat the cost. Luckily as others have suggested on forums and even in reviews here the mic works great, had to use some industrial strength sticky tape to keep them on the metal of my headphones, but for the price this microphone is unbeatable in sound quality.",positive
"This mic is very popular around gamers, espicially if you want to FraGTaLiTy's mic mod. This mic used to cost around $5 dollars. It's a great mic, but why is there a need to increase the price ten fold? I would just go with a Zalman Clip-On. If you have $50 to spend on a mic after $100+ on a headset and $130 on a mixamp go right ahead, but that is something that I will not be doing.",neutral
I've been using this mic for a couple of years now with a nice pair of headphones. Velcroed them on and they're good to go!,positive
I got these because of the price and they not to bad a headset. They are very light and stay in place on your head. The mouth mic foam come off very easy but they work like they should.,neutral
"I like this headset. I have four of them. I find I use PTT most of the time, to avoid cut off first syllables, etc. When I absolutely have to be hands-free, though, the VOX will work, too. Decent, understandable audio, unlike some I've used",positive
"These work perfectly with my Motorola MR350 radios, also purchased fromAmazon. I got them (headsets) only as an after-thought. The sensitivity settings on theradios (for head-set-use) for VOR use are a little touchy. I prefer using thePTT button WITH headsets connected... No breathing or extraneous soundskicking in the transmitter. Still, a good headset.",positive
These work very well with my walkie talkies and give you some privacy when talking through the walkie talkies.  I highly recommend them.,positive
"Works well.Only issue I have is it appears to automatically activate VOX mode. And I'd rather use PTT.Other note might be that compared to the old spirit gt headset, it's not a comfortable. But it's good enough.",positive
Purchase for the Motorola MS350R 35-Mile Talkabout Waterproof 2-Way Radios. The VOX feature automatically sets up when this is plugged in.,positive
"This is very good headset, sound quality is good. The headband is adjustable and very confortable. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn't do VOX with my FR50s (because the FR50 doesn't have VOX capability). Price is reasonable too. What more can I say about a simple headset?",positive
"Plugged this into a Talkabout T6200 and it just transmitted.  Transmit button didn't work, VOX didn't work.  I have a pair of some older model, I should try the headset on those.Would give this 0 stars if I could.",negative
The item served its use; however not the quality I thought it was priced at.,negative
Good product at a good price.The earpiece has soft foam so that it does not hurt the ear after hours of use as one finds with an ear bud or the over the ear headset.Be careful to match the headset to the actual radio purshaced. This headset does not work with all radios.,positive
"This mic works well, but it's a bit awkward.  I got it because the webcam I was using didn't have a built-in microphone for my Yahoo Messenger and Skype live chats.  It was crisp and clear sounding, but I've since upgraded my webcam and no longer need it so much.",positive
"Good quality, good audio and made by Motorola. Was going for a ear cover design but this is way sleeker.",positive
"I bought these earbuds specifically for my helmet and ease of use.  As it turned out the reception for these at high speeds was unreadable and even worse when transmitting.  Not good if you are looking for a cheap solution to communicate between motorcycles.  The boom mic's sold by Motorola are perfect for this...static communications this set up is fine, hiking, skiing, something like that.  For the purpose that I purchased them for, awful...overall product though, good.",neutral
I found that the ear bud was very large for my ear and it kept falling out even though it was under my pull over hat.  It works fine and the push to talk button by the mic bud is a nice feature.,neutral
This is a nice addition to my walkie talkies. Make sure you have the right model Walkie Talkies for this Mic.,positive
"...There are quite afew out there that are more bulky looking. This particular one is more compact. Its features include: an earbud with a mic and PTT (push-to-talk). THe cord is a bit short; however, with my height (5,6), it stands to be just right. I was told that an extension can be pick up at a local Radio Shack.",positive
"This product does exactly what its supposed to do. I don't understand people who expected this product to support VOX. It does not say anything about VOX in product description. I personally don't like VOX, because I don't want my children to hear what I'm saying when I fall down while skiing :-).Anyway the product is OK. The only problem for me is a very short wire, that's why I gave it 4 stars.",positive
"Very dissatisfied with this, the earphone (earbud) is fine, but your voice is very muffled and garbled using the microphone. Even a females voice, usually more clear than a males voice, is very hard to understand using the microphone. I have also not been able to get the iVox feature to work with this either.",negative
Worked but not well made and I have stopped using them and bought a better quality earpiece they did however work,neutral
I purchased these to use with the Motorola TalkAbout and the cases while biking to work.  I sometimes rode a little faster than my biking partner and these helped us to stay in touch.  This was a good purchase.,positive
"I have only one complaint about this earbud/mic unit - the cord is too short. Otherwise, the sound quality is good and the built-in mic with PTT works fine. A 2.5mm extension cord from radio shack (meant for phone headsets, #43-2003) alleviates the cord problem, however. The earbud cushion is comfortable. To be discreet, this is an excellent accessory for your Motorola FRS radio.",positive
Works good but I'm worried for how long. The wire is thin and I'm always worried its going to break at the many connection points. Works with the Motorola two way radios.,neutral
"If the cord was 1 foot longer, 5 stars.  I don't get it.  Is someone saving 2 cents for every one of these?  Or..  make the earpiece cord shorter and the thicker part longer.  Would have been great if it came with a removable ear clip/wire but not really complaining about that.  Maybe a future feature.  Then again, if they can't make the cord 1 foot longer, I wouldn't expect any other luxuries.  Functionally seems fine.",positive
This push to talk ear bud worked great needed it for work and it never failed me. Would purchase again.,positive
We all use these with our Motorola radios while hunting.  The animals are not spooked due to the earpiece.  The earpiece fits comfortably in my ear without the foam.  Just press the button clipped to your collar and others can hear you even with a quiet whisper.,positive
"I haven't really tried this yet, it hangs in my wah and whacks me in the head while I'm driving....I have to rig up some cord restraints that will allow me to still use the thing....I think it will help me communicate when I get the instalation worked out",positive
"Bought it for skiing and although its convenient, its hard to understand people on it. I think itay just be the cold temperature but its been pretty awful about every time I've skied. I used it on a warm day to test it and it seemed fine though. Guess it just isn't great for what I had in mind . The cord is also very short.",neutral
"Motorola 53724 Remote Speaker Mic works well with my scanner, with the speaker mic my radio sounds loud and clear.",positive
"Used for a long road trip with 2 Cars. The Cord lenth isn't horrible, it was ok for my use but I agree... it could be longer. Overall for the 13 bucks I paid for a used one was worth it.",positive
We purchased two of these in hopes of keeping the radios from falling and breaking.  This would keep the radios in our guys pockets.  Worked great for two weeks then nothing.  For both of them.  They are heavy and seemed well made.  Bummer.,negative
It looked good in the box but after hooking it up to my 2-way radio i soon realized it's a joke. You can hear people through it but couldn't talk through it. I had to unplug the mic if I wanted to talk to anyone. 100% waste of $20. I would return it but my luck with getting my money back when I return something isn't good since I never do. Save your $20 and buy something else.,negative
"i was a bit concerned my older Motorola 2-way radio wouldn't work with this product so took a chance, but works flawlessly and have purchased a second one for skiing.",positive
It works very well with all the talkabout radios I have. Only drawback is the clip started to break after 10 days of daily use in the Florida parks. When the clip breaks it gets annoying having to carry it in your hand.,neutral
Purchased for the Motorola MS350R 35-Mile Talkabout Waterproof 2-Way Radios the mic comes in handy if you keep the radios on you hip.,positive
I bought this product for the handhelds I bought a couple of weeks prior. I used this for my job because I was not always in the cafe and if something was needed from the storerooms or there was a customer complaint/problem. They worked great and did as I expected to!,positive
I got these for my hunting radios they work great and make suiting up easy radio chest pocket mic on your lapel good to go.just one thing that little made in china badge on it errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,positive
"I am impressed with this speaker/mic. I'm a first responder so I was interested in getting something like what I have at work for my family radios. The mic is VERY sensitive, so have it about 6-12"" away from your mouth and talk normally... they will hear you fine.  The weight feels very substantial in your hand and feels almost as rugged as what I have at work. I can tell that this is a Motorola product.",positive
"I've been using for 2 weeks now for work communications, with only one problem. The coiled cord is so stiff it pull the mike off wherever I clip it. Either make cord 4-6 inches longer, or she more flexible cord.",positive
"Nice having a speaker mic. Setting the channel on the radio and putting it in the side pocket of the pack and only having the speaker mic on the shoulder strap. Too bad Motorola can not reduce its weight. When hiking, every ounce counts.",positive
I havent had a chance to use the casettes yet but since they are brand new in an unopened factory package I am sure they are just fine. Im just glad they got here quickly!!,positive
"What can I say about this product, fair price and gets job done.  Seems to outlast competition with repeated use.",positive
"Not sure if these tapes are knockoffs, but these tapes jam in our Sony BM-575 portable recorders.  They seem to work OK in our Lanier desk recorders.If we hold one of the the Sony cassettes next to a TDK cassette (which work fine in the BM-575) the tape in these Sony cassettes looks visibly taller.Unfortunately we are stuck with about 30 3-packs now.  I do not recommend this seller or these tapes.",negative
"My idiot producer lost my recorder, so did not get to use more than one of these.",positive
"I received these in perfect condition. They are used with a mini-cassette recorder. I have trouble with good sound from the cassette recorder, so I don't know if I have the correct type of cassettes or the recorder is of poor quality.",positive
"Someone borrowed my sony mini tape recorder to get some detailed infomation and asked if they could keep the tape. I assured them that was fine I would just buy some. Boy, was I surprised when I checked out all the local stores to find that all that was available was digital recorders. So I checked out Amazon and there they were...so thanks for the variey of products supplied by the sellers on Amazon.com!",positive
"The only reason I didn't give this 5 starts is because I'm having a problem finding a place to hang it.  NOT a product problem, it's an issue with me and my vehicle (I don't want to block vents by attaching this to the passenger area in front.  Also note mine came with a webbed, adjustable strap - not the string setup in the picture.",positive
"This bag seems durable, the elastic top keeps stuff from flying out, and the easy dump bottom makes dumping it in the dumpster easy.  What more do you want from a trash bag?",positive
"this is a small and cute bag, a book size.If you have a long drive trip, you may need a bigger one, except dump it often.if you have kids on the trip, you need a bigger one.",positive
Great solution for my car. It hasn't failed in any way. I've used it for over a year now and would certainly rather have it than not.,positive
"Neat little s/w radio. Made a great gift. Great price,fast delivery.",positive
"The best looking Radio in the world, you will love it no matter what. Handsome little machine.",positive
I've had my radio for about six months now and I could not be happier.  It pulls in stations from all over the globe 24 hours a day.  It is easy to use and extremely reliable.  I recently took it to Mexico with me so I could keep up on U.S. news and it provided me with several U.S. broadcasts.  I love this radio.,positive
This is a great radio. It arrived on time. It is everything it said it was and more. I would recommend this radio to everyone. This is my second Grundig and I enjoy them both.,positive
This is one of the best portable radios out there.It has great shortwave reception! The F.M. and A.M. both have great sensitivity and selectivity; the ability to pull in weak stations next to strong ones. The only reason I don't give this radio 5 stars is because of the telescoping antenna. I've been through 5 radios because the antenna becomes lose and breaks after a long period of use. Other than that this would be a perfect radio.,positive
"This is the best camera I have seen for the price. It has tons of features. I would highly recommend getting a Compact Flash Card Reader, so you don't drain your batteries on the camera xfering. Also the Kodak Batteries are the best I have ever used. I would recommended getting the 2 hour rapid charger kit, you will get another set of batteries and be able to charge one set and use another.",positive
works,positive
"'Snagless' ..I thought is was a flat wound cable or something, but it's just a regular cable and overpriced at that.",negative
"If you want solid, well constructed cable that you are never going to have to think about again then Belkin is for you.  I've never had one problem.",positive
"If you're not used to working with wires and lengths, I'd suggest measuring something and testing it out on your setup. Even at 3 feet it seemed shorter than I thought it would be. Luckily my computer sits right next to my router so I didn't have issues there. It was great to move away from my previous wireless connection to a wired connect. Also makes it easier to troubleshoot the network when it's acting buggy.",positive
I like belkin products and need a patch cable to run from my wireless modem to my laptop it fits just right and snaps in tight,positive
Perfect for small jobs where you don't need all that extra cable. I got two just because they were so cheap.,positive
"For the price, whats not to like? It works as well a more expensive ones and I haven't noticed any problems at all.",positive
I needed a cable shorter than 6 feet. The 1' cable I had was too short. The snagless feature is  really useful since I have a tangled nest of cables under the desk - disconnecting and re-connecting will not be a problem.,positive
"Good value for a LAN cable. Works as intended and the color is a breath of fresh air compared to the dull white or popping blue.Can't beat this deal. (if you can, be sure to let me know).",positive
Needed a short cord to reduce clutter between my router and a switch.  Wanted a reliable brand name (Belkin) cord with quality connectors.  This one looks well built. Only shortcoming is that it is cat 5e (350 speed) vs cat 6 (500 speed).  Didn't see a 3 foot one in Cat 6 but the price for the Cat 5e was very fair.,positive
This was bought after we bought 2 new laptops that needed wireless and my desktop isn't!  Just the right size for me to connect to the router!~,positive
"I know it's a silly thing to say about a cable, but I love the color of it! It's difficult to get to the release latch to unplug the cable when it's hooked into the back of a 360, but otherwise it's just what I was looking for. It works fine for System Link, as long as your monitors are close enough together. :)",positive
"it's a network cable, what can i say? it works lol. it would be nice if it had the little cover over the removal prong, but it's no big deal.",positive
"This product works as advertised, I use it to connect my Apple time capsule to a Nother component and it did just fine",positive
Initially I went to a chain box store and purchased a 3 foot CAT 5e. The price was $14.99.Then they pushed an extended warranty. Needless to say I returned it once this one arrived. Pay $1.66 or $14.99? That's a no brainer.,positive
"Now, I'll admit I didn't strip it down and count how many twists per foot, but this blue three foot belkin CAT-5 cable is just about all you can expect from a functional blue 3ft piece of CAT-5 with molded plugs. Yup, shore is!",neutral
"it is a cable. It was nicely made, worked/works just fine. it wa slong enough to get where I needed.",positive
"Good enough price, nice ends, good sheathing, not too stiff.",positive
"I have these connected to my server, computers, switch and NAS server.  Nice short cables so I don't have so much mess around.  Seem like high quality, and they work.  What more can you ask from a cable?",positive
"I find Belkin cables to be fine for their purpose.I'm not sure how you should rate the length of the cord, after all, you buy the length you need!The quality is fine and the price reasonable. (Wish I could say the same about their electronics though. - but that's a different set of reviews sometime.)",positive
"Should have copied my comments from the other CAT 5e cable I endorsed.High quality product, fair price and reliability are the reasons I chose this product.",positive
this cable was very well described came on time and I was very pleased with it would recommend it to anyone,neutral
"I use this to connect my cable box to my router so that I can have a stronger Wi-Fi connection in my room and it still works great! Remember, though, that it is a 3-foot cable, and be sure to keep that in mind when ordering. 3 feet was JUST enough for me, so just be careful!",positive
"Good for short jobs, like connecting my nearby printer to my network switch, which is itself connected by a very long ethernet cable to the router down the hall in another room. Go go Belkin!",positive
"Bought to connect DVR to wall plug in, ordered with 100 Ethernet cable, so price was a factor.  Saved $$ buying it online versus the store where it was $14.00.",positive
"These short cables are perfect for use over the desk, without making a mess. I have a small switch where I connect two laptops and one Raspberry Pi, and long cables would make too much clutter. These cables work perfectly fine in my 100Mbit network, and should also work witn a Gigabit network (not tested). Overall I'm very happy with this purchase.",positive
"Great cable, Super cheap. I got it for less than $2 as an add on. Can't beat hardwiring game consoles.",positive
This item was well made as one would expect. Performed well. Used to connect ethernet switch box to computer modem. This in turn connected my computer and several online entertainment consoles. Did the job.,positive
I mostly use this in hotel rooms and it's been nice having the short cable. It's flexible and the ends make a nice connection. I think with normal use this cable will last me a long time.,positive
This is a great product for connecting a switch and a router or modem. The connectors are very high quality.,positive
Good qualtiy with well-designed connectors.  Extremely useful for short-disstance connections between router and other equipment.Purchased three cables.  Very satisfied!,positive
It's a 3 foot cat 5 cable that lets my router talk to my switch.  No complaints.  Well I have one.  It doesn't clean or cook dinner.,positive
"It is nice to have color coded cables in order to keep track of what goes where. I recently rewired my office and have now color-coded everything, and it is making things MUCH easier. It's nice to know the external network drive is purple, and the networked printer is yellow, etc...",positive
"Im very happy with these cables, I used them for connecting my home theatre to the net via a switch I installed in my entertainment center. The wires are made of high quality materials and seem to be working great so far.",positive
"Inexpensive, but seems to be of good quality. I was looking for a mix of different length cables, and these 3-footers fit the bill for some short patch cables into my ethernet switch, keeping all my devices happy! Good service from Amazon.",positive
This ethernet cable is the perfect length to connect my surround sound receiver to my home network. It works perfectly and is much less expensive than any offerings from local stores.,positive
Needed a short CAT5 cable to hook up a TV from a router and this fit the bill perfectly.  Cable is good quality and works perfectly fine.,positive
"very nice set of wires, i love my purchase. better then the ones you buy in 99c. stores. i bought 5 of them.",positive
"I really thought about buying a crimper, cable, and ends but after adding up the cost it was cheaper to just buy premade cables since I didn't need very many. This cable works fine for my needs.",positive
"Does what I need it to, which is primarily to be a quick disconnect between a coupler and my PC when I don'twant to be online.",positive
Used it for my other computer that was just sitting around. Works perfectly and seems very durable. Cable could be longer though.,positive
needed a new patch cable and this one was a good buy and works like a charm.  No problems with this order.,positive
Outside skin appears to be good.  Ends are solid and pretty well put together.  Color makes it distinguishable from other cables. Skin is obviously thin and would not work outdoors or exposed to weather.,positive
"These 3ft cables are perfect for any networking task. Purchased these to replace the 25 foot Ethernet cables taking up all the space in my computer room. Using these nice short cables, I connected my routers and modem all together much more neatly than I had done using the longer cables.Bottom line: these work as they should. Been using them for about a year with absolutely no problems or complaints.",positive
"Pro:It worked, It's blue and matches my Linksys routers, what more can you say about a cable? Came in a pretty package :-)Using in a Power Over Ethernet (POE) application.Cons:None",positive
I've used this cable to connect a wifi router to a LAN net and even with regular unplugging and plugging for thunderstorms it has given me no trouble and always supplied a reliable connection.,positive
my modem sits right on top of my desktop tower so i needed the smallest ethernet cable i could find and this was it!! superb!,positive
Got several of these 3 foot RG45 Cat 5 patch cable to hook up the connections on my home network distribution panel.  I like these over the stiffer and inflexible yellow patch cables which were way too long.  These 3-footers are just the right length and much more flexible to route it around the 19&#34; distribution frame.,positive
"this is a typical CAT5 cable - nothing special or fancy, but it works. it seems more durable than other crap ones I've used just in that the locking tab that holds it in the jack hasn't broken off after extensive use.",positive
"Works as good as any cable you can buy in your local store, just at a much cheaper price.",positive
This was exactly the length i needed from my modem to my router. It's been perfect since i received it. Internet hasn't disconnected once,positive
"It's hard to gush about a cable, but this was the right amount of cable for a short run, and it worked fine, and the price was good. You have to order it as an add on with something else to make the shipping work.",positive
Came on time and the cable works just fine.,positive
"Nothing fancy here, just a well made product. The price is right and it works flawlessly. I will buy again",positive
"With no wireless where I work, a cable is required to use the internet.This is the best buy I found.I had problems finding a 3-foot cable not wanting cable all over the desk.What I found was $10+ elsewhere, this is the best buy.Yes, it works without any problems.",positive
"Whats blue- 3' long and filled with bits of wire- yeah, stupid joke but this thing works as advertisedYep",positive
"this ended up being alot shorter than what i needed but i'm sure i will find some use for it in the future, very nice looking and well put together",positive
This is a quick fix for a small cable problem.  Fast service to repair a cable connection that was broken.,positive
"I needed a patch cable, and this one is great quality.  The price on Amazon is a fraction of what you will pay for this same item at Best Buy.",positive
"Works just fine, nice blue color, and no trees in the rain forest were used in the manufacturing of the product. Not much else to say.",positive
"I bought these a while ago just to bump up my overall purchase to the $25 (at the time) minimum to receive free shipping.  Not an exciting purchase, but functional as I bring up more devices between my patch panel and main switch.",positive
Its a cable.  It worked. It was long enough. Should of made my own but customer wanted blue. Two more words.,positive
The product was what I expected and the price was the main reason I made the purchase.  I have never gotten a bad wird yet knock on wood.,positive
"good quality, low price and the cables worked as expected.  that is all you can as for from a network cable.",positive
I needed short cables to connect my home theater devices to a single Ethernet Cable by way of a ethernet &#34;switch-router&#34;. These cables fit the bill nicely and the quality is good. Local stores charge much more money for 6' cables which would be an expensivecable eyesore.,positive
"This ethernet cable isn't long and it isn't fancy. However, it has a solid build quality and should last you for years. Great for running in between a router and a closet computer!",positive
"The merchant got this CAT 5e cable to me quickly.  It's well built, doesn't kink, and I like blue.  Great.",positive
"I bought this for my Onkyo receiver which required a direct connect Internet connection to receive the dozen or so channels available (XM, Pandora, Rhapsody, etc.).  It is of good construction and looking (color) and adds some fun to my otherwise mundane system layout.  Live it up and try come of the colors available.Since using daily I've not had a problem at all.  Arrived on time, well packaged, and as I ordered.  Solid good product.",positive
"With a box of over 20 Cat 5 cables I have no idea why I bought this, I must have been drunk. Also claiming a 3-foot cord as Snagless is a bit overboard, but those Marketing Exec's really know what they are doing at Belkin.",neutral
Does what it's supposed to do.Thanks to everyone that takes the time to review products. It is a big help.,positive
to reduce clutter behind the scene with colors to help color co-ordinate the herd gathering behind your electronic devices :),positive
"Does the job nicely, cable is high quality and easy to route. Would buy a bunch more if I needed them.",positive
"I tried it on my laptop and it got stuck. I had to really tug, pull and work at it to get it out. I am not happy with it.",negative
The cable length is what I was looking for and these are priced pretty more than well for what I needed.,positive
"I bought a few of these along with some 25, 50, and 100 ft cables as part of my home surveillance project a while back.There's very little that could impress you about a 3ft cable, but I will say that Belkin, in general, provides great cat cable at extremely good prices.I'm a Belkin customer for life.",positive
These are great for completing a distribution panel - long enough to reach from corner to corner but easy enough to coil if the connection is much closer.,positive
"Ok, so it didn't disintegrate when I opened the package.  The twisty ties were twisty and tied.  The clips on both ends clipped properly. It did not break the first time I used it.  It didn't break when I had to unplug and re-plug it.  It fits most brands of cable management systems.  And data flows through it nicely.I love it.",positive
"If you do wired networking, you will know that there is no such thing as too many patch cables. Usually the ones you have are much too long - hence my seeking & ordering these shorter cables. Certainly as good quality as any others; and WAY WAY cheaper than I have seen in any retail store!",positive
"Sturdy, takes being stepped on etc. The color helps me differentiate one line from Another. Good connections. What else is there?",positive
"It worked for me, but then I pulled it out of a box of other cables. The plastic tip broke off because it caught on something, the other end was already broken. The ends must be quite fragile.",positive
Always Great to get the right size when a longer one is unnecessary and unmanageable. Belkin's Products are very consistent in both quality and price. They hit it all with this one. We have used several of these at work.,positive
Best Cable I've ever purchased...doesn't get all tangled like others do.  Should last longer than others I've purchased.  Will buy more as need arises.,positive
"We needed to hook two computers up to an ethernet switch box.  This short cable was just the right size for the computer which sat next to the switch box.  Very sturdy cable, and the clips on the ends look like they'll last a long time.",positive
You can feel that this cable is made to last. It ahs durabel tips and they feel strong. This works well with all our needs.,positive
It's a CAT-5e cable.  It's three feet long and black.  It worked exactly as described to connect my Kenwood D710 head unit to the main body of the radio.,positive
"Needed a new one. Came brand new in packaging. Works great. Great buy for the money, great product, still use it today",positive
Patch cord was well constructed. Perfect in patch panels and in home networks. Rubber coating looks to be very durable.,positive
"Like the title suggests, why would any comsumer want to pay more for a product that does exactly the same thing?  Sure, there may exist purists that really believe a more expensive patch cable yields better signal delivery, but they'll have a hard time convincing me of an iota of difference.  Belkin is a reliable name that produces a reliable product at a highly competitive price.  I would buy, and will buy, these cables again and again.",positive
This ethernet cable is a great value and works like a charm.  Had it for 2 years and have never had a problem with it.,positive
"I replace my cables every few years, my cable was going out so I placed it with this, things are working so much better now",positive
Purchased this to connect a switch to a 4 port router for extra expandability. There is not much to say here other than if you are looking for a short cable to keep cords clean then look no further.,positive
"Littly pricy, but a great cable.  You will plug this in and never get  another, so why not get it?  You may want a longer one though, I just use  this from my cable modem to my router.",positive
"Does what it should, act as a patch cable for internet connection.  I only needed a short cable, and isnt much more expensive to purchase this ready made one than terminating my own wire.",positive
"I needed only wee little cables to connect computers to switch and these are just the right size.  Handy to have the light blue, everything else is grey or black so I know which cable goes to what at a glance.",positive
"It is well made, soft flexible material instead of cheesy hard plastic.  The length is about right for a patch cord.",positive
"For ethernet cables, I don't need fancy smancy cables to get the job done. These are good and very inexpensive.",positive
A good quality cable at an affordable price. It has worked well for me and I would purchase additional cables of this brand.,positive
"its an ethernet cable. seems to work fine. have had no issues, and passes the signal like it needs to.",neutral
Good quality and you can't beat the price.  BestBuy gets about $25 for a similar cable.  I would buy it again.,positive
These do exactly what you need them to do! What more can you ask for from patch cables? Great quality from Belkin.,positive
"I have never bought a Belkin product i wasnt satisfied with. This is no exception. Not that i really give this cord any thought now that it's in use, but that is the point, isnt it? I guess the only other thing to say, is that being blue, it's easy to find in the mass of cords around my TV and computer area.",positive
Not much to review here. Item was as advertised and worked without problem. The plugs have a guard over the lever which helps keep the snap tab from breaking off.,positive
"Well constructed cable, it is very flexible making it easy to run where you want it.",positive
"i recently ordered this ethernet cable due to mine being so old and long. this cable is the perfect size, works admirably and i received it within a week at a great price!thx u so much! as always i'll continue to shop online at amazon in the future!",positive
"Nice looking cat 5 cable and the length is perfect for most devices. I wish they made several different colors instead of white and black, then you could trace what port and what device it powers.",positive
This is a simple Cat 5 cord and inexpensive. It works great! I would recommend it. I have has no problems.,positive
"I find it hard to say &#34;I love it&#34; about a network cable, but they are of fine quality, so they deserve a 5.  3 feet is pretty short - turns out, a little too short for my application - so be sure that's what you need.",positive
It's a good cable. Not much you can say about a Ethernet cable. It works great.....high quality build.  I would recommend this cable to anyone.,positive
"Hey it's an Ethernet cable,  These things either works or they don't. This one worked fine for me to connect to home router.",positive
What you see is what you get. Just your average cat5e cable. Good for ethernet connections up to 3 feet.,positive
"Great price for a genuine Belkin CAT5e patch cable! The packaging is minimal, which is a plus, since it's just a cable. I ordered a few. They all worked perfectly.",positive
i need a small cable to run from my tv to my ZyXEL WAP3205 and this did the tick! seam to be high qty I tend to like Belkin products,positive
"You'd think all ethernet cables are the same, but after installing thousands of pre-terminated cables in my profession, you get a good intuition of what's good and what's not.  These cables are certainly well made and reliable and an important part of any network.  You won't have any issues with this one so stock up and don't worry about connectivity issues.",positive
Belkin 3-Foot RJ45 CAT 5e Snagless Molded Patch Cable (Blue) worked just as it was I thought it would. Pagkaged well and arrived on time.,positive
"Cables showed up exactly like I expected them.  Packaged neatly and correctly.  I honestly don't know what else to say, they are exactly as advertised.",positive
This produce is well made is from a good company and works as stated very well.  This item came in a very short timne and was all I had expected,positive
"Most people will tell you a cable is a cable.  After dealing with so many different brands, I have concluded that it is not true.  This cable is very easy to manage on a patch panel.  I am completely sold on Belkin cables.",positive
ethernet cables work very  well with my xbox.they looks Great and i hope the color  of the items.thanks so much.,positive
"Not a whole lot to say here.  They are good cables, good price, and arrived quickly.  I would recommend them to a friend.",positive
"This ethernet patch cable works great. I have no problems with the signal running through it. It seems like a solid, well constructed cable. The cable I got is as specified in the product description.",positive
"I needed a cable to connect a new ethernet switch to a modem, and this fits the bill perfectly. Just as described.",positive
i love this patch cable it works great and better than the after market i had speed is faster and better shipment was fast thank for a great product,positive
What more can you ask for but a high quality low cost ethernet cable.  They work and I am happy.,positive
Very fast service. exactly what I ordered..I am never disappointed with Belkin products.Will use Technology Galaxy again.Thank you..,positive
I ordered these because most you find are 6 feet long and I don't want all that cable hanging everywhere because I have cats that will try to play with it and then all my equipment ends up on the floor.  Not now because since I found these on amazon they have not touched them.,positive
What can I really say? It's a standard CAT-5 cable. It seems to be well constructed and it works. There is nothing more to say.,neutral
"it is a 3 foot Ethernet cord....it works, it's blue, it gets 5 stars. I have to type a few more words to give it a review.",positive
This cable is what it is. I needed some extra cabling to attach a computer to my ethernet hub and it works fine.,positive
"This cord works great and the length is just right for me. My only complaint is that the orange isn't quite as festive in person. I thought it would be more neon, but it's actually the dingy orange that you sometimes see on really long extension cords. Orange is my favorite color, so I paid a little extra for it, but I wish I had just gotten one of the cheaper ones.",positive
"Good quality cable. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good, cheap patch cable. I bought them to replace some home made cables, and they work perfectly.",positive
This wire does the trick for my portable WiFi router without having to lug around a long cable.  The three foot length is just right!,positive
"I connect a long ethernet wire to TP-LINK TL-SF1005D 5-port 10/100Mbps Desktop Switch which inturn uses 3 of these belkin ethernet cables to connect all my devices and they work perfectly.I connect my TV, XONE and PS4 and all of them work at full speed.",positive
"Plugs are not plated (full plastic), which can causes mass problems.They do their job as expected for the rest.",neutral
Not much to say about wire - it does the job.  We use this to connect an upstairs computer with a downstairs printer.,positive
It's a piece of cat5 with snagless ends.  It is blue in color and approximately three feet in length.  Good for making short patch connections.  Nothing wrong with it at all I would purchase more if needed.,positive
I saw the mixed reviews but went ahead and took a chance on this.  I am happy to report that it was in fact 3 feet and works perfectly connecting my modem to my computer.  The price was great the big box store wanted $25 for a 6 foot cord.This is a great value for a small space and it looks just like the picture.  I recommend the product.,positive
"I just installed a network between my two home computers, and this cable did the job perfectly.  It worked just like it is supposed to, and the 50ft length gave me all the cable I needed, with plenty left in case I decide to re-arrange the desk locations.  WELL worth the $10.99 price.",positive
"It works, it's snagless. Perhaps with some high end test equipment I could find a flaw, but none are visible by me. Five stars.",positive
"Using this cable to connect my PS3 to the router, and it's working fine. I don't know my upload or download speeds, but playing movies off Netflix and playing games online has been trouble free.",positive
"We got one spare computer table in the room and just 20 minutes ago I set up everything and works perfectly! It is connected to our router in the living room and right now I am  playing the music player on our Xbox accessing my mp3 songs on this computer. So happy with this Belkin ethernet cable. Oh another thing, its wires aren't awkwardly bent like other cables after you remove it from its packaging...",positive
The cable was just exactly the length I needed.  The no kink feature is really nice.  It worked very fine.,positive
These where exactly what I needed for my blu-ray player. The price was great and could not be beat at any store that I looked at.,positive
"Cable is high quality, was shipped on time and packaged well.  I have used cheaper cables but they are not as well-made and durable as this Belkin cable.",positive
Works fine. No problems with any of the connectors. Packaging was fine when I received it. Overall no problems and works to standard.,neutral
"There's not much to say.  This cable does the job intended and works just fine. Considering the price, it's a great buy!",positive
ita a cable it does what it supposed to do and does it good been doing it for a while now and hope keeps on doing seems like it like what its doing,positive
"While it seems silly to sit and glorify the merits of a cable, the Belkin series of cables are truly great. I have a number of varieties of them, and they are all excellent - well made, work great, and the snagless aspect actually is qite good. Good connectors that won't break soon, too.",positive
I needed an extension that was not wireless so that I could reduce the buffering in downloading and watching movies and this does the job adequately.,positive
I use it to run to my router and keep my family happy haha thank you for selling this item to me,positive
"Great quality cable, I wouldn't buy anything of a lesser quality and it has the stubs on the end to protect the connector that often breaks off....",positive
I bought it to hook up my x-box 360 to my computer. It works great and i did not have to spend $100.00 on a wireless.,positive
This product works flawlessly and provides a great signal for my extended network system. I highly recommend this cable.,positive
I snaked it through a wall.  The ends held up just fine.  My media PC has excellent internet connection through FIOS.,positive
"What can I say...it is cable. It is long, it is blue, it does its job and the price was right..",positive
"I'd not going to go nuts here - I mean, it's just a cable. But 50ft of CAT5 at the oxymoronic 'Best Buy' would mean unloading your wallet, so $12 is a reasonable price and the cable has been working fine ever since.",positive
"This is just what it says it is. A good, moderate cost cable for joining parts of an ethernet network. The connectors are large enough to grasp easily and they are snag proof as you pull them around furniture, etc.",positive
"I bought this ethernet cord for my home network and it has worked flawlessly. Not much else I can say...it works as you would expect it to, and the price is great.",positive
"Works great, but I'm not too sure what snagless molded patch means, but definitely able to hook my desktop into my router! I wish they had black though...",positive
"I wanted to buy a good cable, not a cheap one and this one seems to be made well and is working good.",positive
"Very sturdy, Just what I needed since my PC does not like to &#34;go wireless&#34; all the time. I just keep it plugged in with this chord and all is good. And when my MAC has issues with wireless, I can give it a turn.",positive
"And now I have one.  I tested it, tied to multiple connectors back to the source and it works perfectly, with no delays, etc.",positive
Used this to hook up wired router for 2nd computer.  It is a quality product.,positive
"50ft for $9!!  What else needs to be said?This cable is every bit as good as the $50 bundles you'll see at Office Depot.  I bought about 7 of these and every one of them works great.  I have my home security system wired up on this particular cable.Its a great buy, and I'm a Belkin customer for life now.",positive
"The cable worked, was able to negotiate a gigabit connection as expected.  There's not much more to say. . .",positive
"priced right and worked flawlessly, i recommend this item for home networking and will use again in the future.",positive
It's very blue and does not snag even if you try.  I really like how blue it is and it also works well.,positive
"Good product and it does the job.... and great price.....  seems to be very well made, just as most all Belkin products are.",positive
I opted for this one after reading reviews of some of the other cables made by other manufacturers. It is the cable ends that are usually of concern. The Belkin cables are fine. The ends are very well made and snap into their sockets nicely. I have used it to hardwire an internet streaming box to my router. It is functioning just fine.,positive
"I am using several Belkin patch cables along with this one.  They all work as advertised, have a good design on the connectors and come with a lifetime warranty...",positive
"Gotta put in 20 words,,  so what can I say, it is a pre made item, made by a great cable maker, so this thing will work great and it was a great price,  usually stores are out to kill you on price so this fit the bill to connect two rooms together on my network.",positive
Works perfectly. Great value. Connecting internet modem to TV in living room via basement in order to use Netflix/Pandora. Blue makes it easy to recognize what it is if we ever have to distinquish it from other lines.,positive
"Yup... They connect my cable modem to my router, and my router to my computers. They transmit data back and forth. So far they have failed to burst into flames or snap off and poke me in the eye. So go patch cables (yay).",positive
"This 50ft cable is flawless, snagless, no more kinks in the cable.The connectors are nice and soft and I love the blue color.This cable works like a charm and well worth the price at 50ft length.Highly recommended - cheaper than Radio Shack!",positive
"I needed a cable to go across my house, and this one did that job fine. I was really afraid I would have to pay a lot of money for a 50' cable, but this cable proved me wrong. It is not expensive(...). The snagless connectors were very useful when I was dragging the wire under my floors (though some tape probably could have done the job). I have not noticed any loss in performance because of this cable.",positive
Cable worked great will buy again when i need another cable.  Very durable and works like it should.Would recommend if you need a DSL cable,positive
"Received these (2) quickly, packed well in BELKIN packaging. Snaked thes thru walls and got a tight connection with nice signal strength. I needed the 50'. Glad that I didn't go with my first assessment of 25&#34;All was right with the ordering, packaging and delivery.Ran from DSL router to computer and ROKU.",positive
"This cable is such a great price, ....that ....that alone is a great reason to buy it........ It helped me extend the distance of my signal, without the cost of having to buy a signal booster",positive
have been using this cable for 3 months now with zero problems. ive got it running thru my apartment because our router is in my roommate's room. a quality cable that is reliable and dependable! i love it!,positive
Prompt delivery. The extension cord allows me the extra length I sometimes need when I must be away from my desk while teaching and using my ipad.,positive
"I used this for a server I have running in a corner of the room away from my PC.  I plugged this into one monitor port, and now I don't have to use a finicky remote control software to access the PC.  The cable is good quality and provides a clear image of the screen.",positive
Great price and it did exactly what I needed it to do. If you need to make your cord stretch after rearranging some furniture this works fantastic.,positive
I use this to have an extra monitor closer to my ham shack.  It does the job but the screws don't reach the nuts so I only could plug the cord in and could not screw it in place.,neutral
ordered a few of these they work great.  Perform like the newest cables with out the cost.  A true buy.,positive
"This was not the right cable i needed, so cannot give it a glowing report. Returned it and bought the right HDMI cable.",positive
My projector Universal port adapter was only 2 ft long. This was an excellent addition. Now my computer does not have to sit so close to the projector.,positive
"The screws to tighten the plug feel cheap, but the cable works just fine. I'm using it for an old 17&#34; monitor and the picture looks just dandy.",positive
"I was looking for an extension for my 42""tv/monitor in the living room when i found this one i have bougth belkin products before and have had good luck with them this was a very good buy for the price better than going to the retail stores and buying there.",positive
Purchased to use second monitor on my PC. Configuration of my setup required a longer VGA cable. Does the job perfectly!,positive
"The first two times I plugged this into my projector, it took a couple times unplugging and replugging to get it connected.  Now I can't get it to work at all.  Unfortunately, I had it over a month before I tested it, so now I can't return it.",negative
"If you have to run a legacy DOS program, it's getting progressively harder to find these things.There's also the issue of a maximum length for a functional parallel cable before things start malfunctioning.This one works just fine, and is inexpensive, as well.(So how much more can one rave about a rather intentionally mundane object?)",positive
"With my setup I have my printer and a zip drive running off the same cable, and since I bought this Belkin cable I havent had any problems. It is also very easy to screw and un-screw onto the computer as it has  different knobs than the standard printer cable.",positive
This extra long (25') cable enabled me to relocate my printer to a more covenient location in my home office.,positive
This item is perfect for those of you who still have older HP workhorse laser printers. Thick construction and super long cable.,positive
"Worked perfectly to run from a desk, around a wall to an Oki dot-matrix impact printer. Not a single problem. Typical great Belkin quality.",positive
"Excellent speaker system for the price. Extraordinary sound, and great Bass. Fully recomended to anyone shopping for computer speakers.",positive
"...not very loud, and the sub tends to get boomy. other than that, best sound for the money(still is). perfect &quot;hi-fi&quot; for a student living in a dorm...took it to a friend's home with a portable cd player. my friend laughed at my portable gimmicky stereo at first. they weren't laughing anymore when they heard it playing.",positive
"these speakers are great, great sound from a cheap sound card, full sound and power.",positive
Very high level of noise three pixels on all the time. Otherwise it's about as good as a low quality surveillance cam. I don't know  what the other reviewers are used to but they need to look around. For the price it's OK in good light forget it when the light begins to fade. The software is somewhat deficient too. when I tried to do a video capture it froze up.I would not recommend this to anyone,negative
"This is an incredible camera, especially in regard to its low-light capabilities. I used mine for years, but as Windows OS versions changed, the camera became less and less cooperative with the PC, and with Windows 7 finally stopped working completely. (It didn't do that well with XP, either).So, if you're running an OS older than XP, you can't go wrong with this camera; especially at this price!",positive
"Pros: It's actually a relabled Vicam, which has been favorably reviewed in the past.  Excellent low light performance.  Detachable USB cable is easily replaced with a longer one.  Comes with an unregistered copy of webcam32  which is an excellent program for putting your camera on the web.Cons:  Apparently 3com now owns the product, so expect no driver updates and no  useful customer support.",positive
"Far better resolution and optical quality than more recent webcams, these 3Com computer video cameras are still useful many years after being discontinued. At the time, they were available with interchangeable focal length lenses as well. Worth seeking out.",positive
"&#34;Great camera. But it is made for Widows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 2000. The furnished drivers are for those systems only, and will not work with later operating systems. Also, I cannot locate any Vista or Win7 drivers for the camera. Too bad !The Mac does not even recognize that the camera is connected.",neutral
"Palm comes with a stylus.  If you lose it then buy this, otherwise it's a waste.  And by the way, if you have long fingernails you can use that to input into your Palm when you're too lazy to take the stylus out",neutral
"High-quality stylus, 3 of them even! They even seem better than the one that was actually included with my Palm Pilot. A stylus is an easy thing to misplace, lose, just like a pen, so its great to have a few in your briefcase or purse!",positive
The stylus fits perfectly in my antiquated palm pilot and I really like the weight of the stylus.  My pda might be old but it works for me.  Thank you very much!,positive
"Your Palm V probably came with two -- one metal with plastic ends and a hidden pin to reset your palm, and one all plastic.  These are exact replacements for the metal stylus that came with your Palm.  That's about  it!For the price it seemed like a good idea to have them around just in  case.  You can also keep a spare in each car, or whatever.",positive
The USB version of the Dazzle DM4100 video capture box is an excellent way to capture video into the MPEG1 format in real time.  This format plays back well on modern PC and Mac computers but doesn't take up too much hard drive space.  The quality isn't as good as a professional encoder but then  it costs about a tenth of the price.,positive
"If you want a small, low resolution image that has unsynchronized audio (or you have forever to wait on the audio sync), this one is for you!  Oh, yea, don't expect to be able to videoconference with your camcorder.If  you want to capture home videos with no or low loss of quality and want it  done at a reasonable speed, you probably don't want this one (or any other  USB or similarly slow external connection).",negative
"DVD's work just fine in this player.But I purchased it with the intention of viewing home movie VCD's.Not happenin'.No matter what I try (VCD,SVCD,different cd-r disks,...) this model WILL NOT play them.I've seen DVD players costing under $100 play the very same VCD's without any problems.",negative
"Mine is a just over a year old. Guess what? Yep, it's croaking. In fact, every Sony product I bought the past decade -- a phone, 2 portable CD players, a TV, and now this -- failed just after the warranty expired. I've finally learned my lesson.",negative
"The DVD player is great.  Perfect mid-range player, with a good mix of features vs. price.  Did notice a lip-sync problem with one DVD, but it has not occurred in the past month or two, but I shall keep watching for  it.If you get this DVD player, you will not be disappointed.",positive
"The &quot;lip-synch&quot; problem has shown up on my 550D model once while watching over 30 movies.Other than this issue, the DVD player rates 5 stars!!!",positive
This is a great little camera. A real bargain at this price. Excellent color and quality pictures. Only drawback is slow serial interface to computer. Buy a Flashpath floppy adapter or a memory card reader to  transfer pictures faster. A good card reader that won't crash your system  is made by SIIG. They call it their USB DigiFilm-Combo Reader. About $79  street price. Also get the MAHA charger and NIMH batteries reviewed  elsewhere on this page.,positive
"This DVD player is great for home or travel. Only two little quirks: the bottom gets really hot, and you can't plug it in to a car outlet. Otherwise it is really cool!",positive
"if you like dvd watching on planes or in airports, this player is excellent.  it does get a little hot, but not too bad.  the amount you pay for this unit has come down now due to a new model out in a few months with  a 7 inch screen.",positive
"Otherwise very good - Never tested limits of the battery - have used on AC generally - works very well, pricey - I would wait for one more generation if too expensive",positive
"I get only 2:15 of battery life on average, barely enough to watch a good movie.I'd love to see cheaper packs, or a camera battery add on option.It plays +R but not +RW disks.",positive
This is a very good product! It still take a charge! Very good echarable battery. My husband uses it for his recording mixer! Good to have for outdoors use.,neutral
"I charged this battery up and tried it in my garage door opener remote - it used to open from about 80 feet away, but now it barely works at 10 feet.  I'd recommend that you stay away from this 9V.  I have been quite happy with the other NiMh sizes from Energizer.",negative
They don't hold a charge.  I have found it's a lot cheaper to buy regular Duracell batteries at Costco and just keep replacing!,negative
We use this in our alarm clock for when the power goes out as it often does.  So far this little rechargable hasn't needed a recharge & is doing a fine job making sure when get up on time when the power goes out & then back on while were sleeping.  I gave it 4 stars because we haven't had it long enough to get a really good opinion on it aside from the one just given.,positive
SO FAR SOO GOOD ...IT WORKS AND RUN LIKE A POWER BATTERY!!! IF YOU LIKE POWER THIS IS A MUST BUY,positive
"This battery, like other rechargable batteries I own, is rated for 8.4 volts and I'm told is likely even less.  Why not go with Maha?  It's rated at over 9 volts, which for my applications (powering a headroom micro dac) makes all the difference.  I can only imagine that a battery with a rating which conforms to a devices' designated power requirements, is better across the board.",negative
"I like Energizer rechargeable batteries. I've used several before.This one is on a sprinkler timer and so far, so good.",positive
"I teach 4 one-hour classes a week, which require a 9-Volt battery for the mic. I got tired of buying these every week or two, so I bought the rechargable.  The single charge lasts the entire week. I recharge it on the weekends and I'm ready to go...no problems so far.  I've had it for 3 months or so..",positive
"works good, much sturdier than the cheapo other brands. definitley a keeper!",positive
"I have used this charger for a while and it works really well.  It charges both NiMH and NiCd batteries in all sizes AA,AAA,C,D& 9 volt.  A full charge takes about six hours.  You can charge different sizes at the same time.  I consider this charger a very good investment and recommend it to all.",positive
great for the 9volt and D but for AA and AAA it does not do as fast as the smaller rapid charger ones form energizer.,positive
"I use the cable at home on my home desktop PC.  It's great for synchronizing my Palm IIIxe with my home and work PC.  I use avantgo.com at home to add news to my Palm (which I can't do at work).Best of all it is cheaper then the cradle and it does the exact same thing.  The only thing missing is the button that you get on the cradle.  Instead, you launch HotSync from your Palm.",positive
"If you're going to sync from more than one computer, this is a far better option than buying an additional cradle.  To offset the lack of the convenient button on the cradle, you get better portability, a lower cost, and can hook it up to Palms that live in a carrying case without having to rip it away from the velcro.",positive
"I received this DVD player yesterday 11/30/99 and my son tried to install it. He is not a genius at electronics. We called the Toshiba service 1-800 support line and were patiently assisted with the installation. This was  extremely helpful to us. This is easy to install but if you aren't an  electronic wiz, this is a very good asset. The DVD player itself seems  flawless to us at this point. I would recommend it highly.",positive
Found an old palm in my basement and wanted to get it working again. Took a chance and bought this cradle to charge it and sure enough it booted up. I have no real use for either the palm or the charger but for as cheap as it was I got it. Worked well.,positive
I bought this Palm V Hotsync Cradle as a replacement to my old one that had been stolen...The cradle itself works great. It is easy to install and required no extra software if you already the Hotsync software installed. A good product.,positive
Didn't work for my device but it lit up and worked. I sent it back with no problem and a full refund.,positive
It does what is advertised. Charges palm V and is also  downloads to pc. That I haven't been able to try as the plug on the end of the cable is female and the connection to my laptop is also female. Need an adapter. The charger works great and if it came with a usable connection I would have given it a 5 star rating.,positive
"Perhaps the only bummer with the Palm V series is that they have a slow serial port connection, which takes much longer to Sync than a USB port. I'd recommend buying the USB PalmConnect kit instead, which costs about the same. Shop around.",neutral
"This travel kit takes too much space. If you would like to connect your Palm V or Vx to two computers, I suggest you either buy another cradle, or pack your cradle. A cradle takes up as much space as this travel kit, and  it's better. Remember you can also hot sync through the infrared port if  you have a computer with an infrared port, but this drains the batteries a  lot.",negative
"The item pricing was good however, I did not get to enjoy their uses because I could not get my palm pilot completely operational...something had expired?.",neutral
"This is very useful addition for Palm for people who travel internationally. Unless you are someone who travels to all the corners of the world, you may never use some of the plug adapters. I particularly like the hotsync cable. I can use it for syncing the Palm with my notebook.Comes in a neat pouch too.",positive
"I travel quite often, and lugging around the weighty Hot Sync/Charger cradel adds some pounds to my briefcase. With the travel kit, the charger and Hot Sync cable are seperate, and much lighter, without the stand like the cradle. Works just as good as the cradle too. I like the fact that the charger comes with 3 extra plugs, which can be used for different countries! Great travel kit at a reasonable price.",positive
"Like the previous reviewer, I also purchased the Kodak NiMh batteries and charger and have found it to be a much-needed improvement to the standard package.  Too bad Nikon doesn't include this as standard equipment with its  digital cameras.  My wish list:  an automotible cigarette-lighter adapter  so I can recharge batteries &quot;on the fly&quot;.  Overall, a quality  product that functions as advertised and provides good value for the money.",positive
"For a slightly less price, you can get yourself a negative pulse charger.  A negative pulse charger strips away sulfate buildup and gas bubbles that basically ruins any rechargable batteries.Take a look at the Maha C210 charger or Radio Shack cat 23-422 pulse charger.  They're microprocessor controlled so that you can't overcharge your batteries.  With the C210 you can charge any type of battery ranging from 3V to 12V.",neutral
"It's a great charger. You can basically bring it to anywhere you go. But one advice, don't buy too many batteries, because most of the time you think  that you really need a lot of batteries, but after you really bought  a lot of batteries, you will realize that you don't need that much! And  regret about wasting money. And if you are out of battery, you can just  charge them again, two hours after, they are full charged.",positive
I used once.  Very bad quality.  I bought a Manfrotto tripod.  I love it.,negative
"...you simply can't beat this deal!GREAT LITTLE TRIPOD!Does the job perfectly as a lightweight ""back-up"" tripod.I do have another big, heavy tripod for windy days but plan to carry this one on hiking trails and long distance trips.Just what I needed.",positive
I got all excited since this was a very inexpensive tripod and the reviews were good. Got the item and the first time I used it for Christmas eve photosthe lever that releases the pan and tilt head broke off. Other than that this is a good starter tripod.,negative
"This tripod is too short (I virtually always use it extended to full height, including the head), too flimsy (it struggles to hold my Canon 400D still, even with a small lens), and difficult to adjust (the same camera is virtually impossible to hold at much of an angle).  The removable head is also a bit flimsy.  However, it's also light, and ridiculously cheap.  Don't pay more than $15 for it, and you won't be disappointed.",neutral
"I am amazed with this tripod , it's light and east to set up . the bag is nice too. I can't believe it's so good for such a low price !!",positive
"I received this tripod for Christmas and I am totally delighted with it!  It comes with a case and is small and light enough for me to carry.  In just a few days use, it has made a difference on my low light level and non-flash photos.",positive
The only reason i give it 4 stars it's because i only paid about 8 bucks for it but it's a toy...,positive
"You can't beat the price for a full size tripod for your camera. Great for taking pictures of low light settings, night shots, etc. since the tripod will keep the camera still and won;t blur the shot. The only bad thing is the shipping on this is more expensive than the tripod itself! Still worth it for about $20.",positive
"cheap plastic breaks easy, treat gently",positive
These Teac drives are great. I have them for about 2 months and no problems. Just remember - No cable comes with purchase so make so you have a cable.,positive
"Does Not Work for 720k formatting. If you need to be able to format to 720k, this will not work. Otherwise it works fine, but I gave it 2 stars because I am unable to use it and I hope others can be saved the trouble.",negative
This drive made it possible to read some old floppy disks on a new PC.  The new motherboards do not have floppy interfaces.,positive
Win 7 detected device without problem.  Wrote to and read from multiple disks without an issue.  Great option for making a boot disk for older pc builds/resurrections.,positive
"Good drive, seems to read floppies more reliably than an old internal drive that I was using to try to recover old data.  Used on Windows 7 x64 with no drivers or installation needed, just plug-and-play.",positive
"Not much to say here, it works for me.  I was able to access my old floppy drives.  Windows detected it without needing to search for drivers.",positive
"The product was delivered on time and seems to work OK, albeit a little slow - but floppies are slow. I used this to transfer some data from an older XP machine to my new Windows 8 computer. No problem as far as I can presently determine.",positive
"As others have mentioned, only works with 1.44 disks.  Out of curiosity, did try a single sided 400 and double sided 800 but no luck.  Works ok.  Build feels a little cheap, dive itself is pretty noisy.  I ended up returning & simply using an old computer to read floppies.  If this is your only option worth giving it a try.",neutral
"Needed a drive for some of my photos that are still on disk.  This one was cheap, but very difficult to eject the disk.  Not satisfied with this at all.",negative
does not work with Win& out of the box - have yet to find anything to make it work - find an older machine (XP) and see if you can extract your data.,positive
Work well right out of the box after computer searched for and downloaded drivers. Only used once for single floppy with much needed data. Durability unknown. Price was right.,positive
"Floppy drive was a great purchase.  Works on all my machines of varying 64/32 bit, operating systems, and motherboard configurations.  Highly recommend this to others.",positive
"The unit works flawlessly.  Unfortunately, many software applications that still require floppy disks don't recognize USB floppy drives.  My app is one of those.  I have a partial work-a-round.  I run the software as administrator and despite receiving an error message that no floppy drive exists, the drive starts working.  Go figure.  The 3 stars represents a warning to the buyer to make sure that their applications recognize USB floppy drivers.",neutral
"Had a client who brought me a 3.5&#34; disk and told me he had to have the data off of it.  Never thought I would have to buy a floppy drive or even use one.  Crazy, but this did exactly what I needed it for even in Windows 8.1.  I figured when I plugged this into an 8.1 machine, Windows would basically tell me, &#34;What is this?  1.44 MB, hahahah&#34;",positive
this device worked perfectly just connect it to the motherboard usb headers and your done windows 7 picked it up and it reads my floppy disks with no problems!,positive
"So you have your tax records on a floppy, and you need to get that DATA! Whip this bad boy out and you are good to go!",positive
Its great.. Did exactly what I needed it to do. Works with Mac Mini. Did not have any problems. :),positive
I was very happy with this drive.  It di exactly as described. Simplicity and speed of operation.,positive
"This same drive seems to be sold under many different brand names. Obviously not very high quality, but I need the ability to transfer data by floppy disk to an older machine & this seems to be the only option.I bought 2, 1 works (for now) and the other just wanted to reformat all the time, whether there was a disk in it or not. I guess I'll order a couple more for spares.",neutral
I had an internal drive stop working on a desktop and got this instead of finding a new internal drive. It works great.,positive
It would not work. The software would install properly. I will be returning the item. Very disappointed in the product.,negative
The Sabrent External USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive was exactly what I was looking for... It works perfectly and saved me from destroying all my saved 3 1/2 floppy disks...,positive
"I have had this product for about three months now, It works on several media types just as described. I would recommend it to anyone. This is used by me only occasionally, so I do not know about someone using it all the time.",positive
"Works great. after all how difficult could it be to make a good floppy drive.I was thinking of getting a used one, but this one is cheaper and gives peace of mind.- compared it with sony external usb and found this one cheaper.- very sturdy, dropped couple of times but it still works.- very plug and play.- never gave me a chance to complain.- works comparaeable to my sony vaio integrated floopy drive",positive
Works like a charm. I have used it on two computers and it has worked well on both. I am able to transfer data from the floppies to my hard drive.I would recommend it.,positive
Fabulous product at a great price. A very simple &#34;plug 'n' play&#34; way to transfer all those pictures that are on floppy disks,positive
Easy to install (just plug it in) and you have instant floppy. I have a few old photo disks that I wanted to copy the files off of and no computer with a floppy disk. Very inexpensive but well constructed and works great.,positive
"EASY HOOK UP,DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPPOSED TO DO.THE PRICE IS NICE TOO!A LOT OF US 'OLD TIMERS' STILL GOT STUFF ON FLOPPYS.",positive
"Company replaced the item. So I raised the rating to 3 stars.  It makes keeping track of the CAC convenient. The company makes one that is better constucted. Recommend buying that one,",neutral
"Easy hook up --- just plug and play.  Now that non of the newer computers have a floppy drive, I thought it was important to get a drive before they stop making them.  I have a lot of old photos and documents stored on floppies and no way to access them, until I got this drive.  I like it so well that I will probably order another one.",positive
"I never thought i would need to look at a floppy drive again, but lo and behold, a customer had some very important data stored on some very old floppies.  This saved his data and his price can't be beat.  Not a bad addition to have for your toolkit for that rainy day.",positive
"Does as advertised, performs well. Worked flawlessly right out of the box. Everything needed was already present in my Wintendo 7 install.",positive
"Arrived on time, in good shape, and works without hassle on Windows 7.......... we need 3.5 for our business machines and this fits the bill.",positive
I had a bunch of photo disks that I wanted to upload. And this product fit the billInstallation was plug and play - and the product worked flawlessly.,positive
It works fine.  Just plug it into a USB port and it will allow me to access old floppy disks.,positive
I still have some floppies that I need to look at occasionally.  This device makes that possible.  It seems to work with any PC,positive
"My new computer has no 3.5 inch floppy drive, but I still have several such floppy disks with data I wanted to retrieve.  This disk drive read the floppies just fine so I could save the data directly to the computer.This drive is a little slow, but it gets the job done.  For the price, it's a great and very useful buy!",positive
I used this external floppy disk drive to recover some photos and documents that I had from back in the DOS and Windows 3.1 days.  It read my disks just fine and I was able to transfer everything to my new system.,positive
"When you need a floppy disk for an older computer to update BIOS, this works great.  Portable, Windows and the BIOS saw the device without any problem.  No brainer purchase if you are going to work on older computers.",positive
"Works well on both OSX and Windows 7, haven't tried it on Linux yet.  Now I remember how slow floppy disks were....",positive
"Works well, for the price. Occasional miss read. Unplug and try again fixes the problem. Just was trying to recover some old files I found. Did the job. Cheap enough.",positive
"I bought this to use for work and works great, I've had no problems and I like that its plug and play.",positive
Everyone in a while I get a customer that needs/wants to read old floppy disks.This drive is great for the money and installs in windows 7 and 8 without drivers.Good drive!,positive
I plugged it into my computer and... nothing. Tried it in several different computers (windows 7 and windows 8) and the device is completely dead. Will not be recognized by computers. The worst part is I cannot return it as of a few days ago. I would recommend trying a different brand.,negative
"Plugged it in, popped in a disk and in a couple seconds the disk appeared on the desktop. Shockingly Mac OS still has actual icons for a floppy disk built in.Highly recommended if you need to dump some old files off floppies.The only minor downside is it makes a hum/whine while idle with a disk in it. I guess that's the price you pay for 2x the RPM.",positive
"Works as expected and is nice considering that even if you have an old floppy, newer motherboards don't have the connector anymore.",positive
"No problems with the drive, delivered as promised, good price.  This really has saved me as I have some old 3 1/2 diskettes that have photos on them and no working machines with a drive to read them.",positive
This unit seems to work great. I was able to read all but three of my 50 floppy discs. Not sure why the three wouldn't read. Might be their age. But the Sabrent Floppy drive was great. It worked from the USB power.,positive
"I thought for the price it would be a complete kit. It's OEM! It's just a bare drive, no cable, no driver, manual - nothing. If you know what you're doing or are replacing an old floppy it'll do, but you can find bare drives for a much much cheaper price elsewhere. They should put that it's OEM in the description.",neutral
"I like this product.  Just know that if you have labels on the floppy disk, more than one, the disk will get stuck on ejection.  The tolerance is too tight in that regard.",neutral
"This review is for the Sabrent USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive (FL-UDRV) Black.  It's a well built, quality floppy disk drive that comes with a hardwired USB 2.0 cable for connection to the computer.  There's really not much to say except that it works ---- simple setup, plug and wait for drivers to load and install --- then use the drive.  How hard is that?",positive
"It doesn't work with DD disks, only HD disks. We had a few of the former and we had to decide to just give up on them.It mounted fine on a macbook, and even transferred our old System 7 mac disks.We did get a defective one first, but Amazon replaced it quickly enough.",neutral
Works well and allowed me to transfer all old data off floppy.  Now I can get rid of old computer.,positive
"*  It is indeed plug and play...I just plugged it into the USB on my Lenovo laptop (Windows 7).  I was able to view every file on numerous floppy disks.*  Great price.  If you have some old, old floppies around, I recommend getting this little beauty.  You might have some wonderful old files/memories you had forgotten about on those floppies.",positive
I plugged the drive in and my Win 7 PC indicated it was downloaded a driver.  After that I could read and writes files just fine.  It does have an annoying habit of refusing to eject disks with labels on them.  I've had to simultaneously hold the eject button and extract the disk with tweezers.,neutral
This is a well made floppy drive that has no apparent issues that could have crossed paths with me or the application I put it in.,positive
work great,positive
was terrible did auto connect and was complete waste if time thanks for telling it doesnt always work good going,negative
"Works very well.  Not the greatest sound but it's just the thing for patio parties, etc.  Make sure to read the manual first.",positive
"Wish I read the reviews here more completely. This was a complete piece of trash. Like with others, the speaker would not play for more than 30 seconds at a time no matter what I did. After a while I could feel that the speaker was over heating so I left it unplugged. Sure enough it came back and played for another 30 seconds and then quit. It's going back to Amazon immediately!",negative
Just hooked it up and it works great. We've got the Reds game on the television inside and the audio coming through the speaker outside so we won't miss anything! So far so good.,positive
"The sound from the unit is descent given the size and construction. The wireless system,  however is pretty bad. In an urban area you might be able to get 20', but even then you'll get periodic interference. In a more rural setting it becomes moderately usable, with more like 40' and fewer blasts of junk.",negative
"I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this unit was to set up.  Within 5 minutes, I had the unit set up and playing on my back patio.  No static or distortion on CD or radio once I &quot;tuned&quot; in the box.  Unit sounded great with a balanced mix of bass and treble.  Make sure that the speaker is sheltered outside since the instructions explicitly state that it will not handle excessive rain or wet weather!",positive
"Being able to enjoy music with a wireless speaker is fantastic. The speaker is small enough to be innocuous but delivers pretty good quality sound. On occasion, especially very humid days, it's harder to get the receiver to pick up the signal, but overall we're happy with the product.If you can buy the speaker at a deep discount, like we did, then you'll be happy with the product.",positive
"Works fine for my purpose, a wireless speaker I can move wherever I want to listen to my main stereo.  I use it in the kitchen and by the pool, which are not wired for my stereo.  Sounds about as good as an inexpensive boom box and has a good range.",positive
"This must have been the best handycam for the price when I bought it! And I love the death out of it! All I can say is that this camera would still be great if it were still manufactured, 3 years later! If you find one someone who is selling this camera in good condition, by all means get it! It's a great camera!",positive
"A great little radio. I used it on my flight from AZ to NH. The FM and AM came in just great. Not sure about the shortwave as I wasn't able to pick up anything. But then again, I didn't really try. I like the small size. Fits in my jacket pocket. A smart looking radio. Price is reasonable.CON: The ear plugs are useless. Will not stay in the ear.",positive
It's a very good radio for emergencies and Grundid is an excellent name. I also believe it was on sale. It works fine and I recommend it Highly.,positive
"I've used this product for about an hr now and its going back.Can't stand its sound quality - one tone, shrill sound. Hurts my ears.Stay away from this one!!",negative
"This radio has good sound for a radio this small with verylittle overload on FM. Not quite as selective as the Yacht Boy 400, but good. Better than the Sangean 220 and my Sony walkman.The AM is good for nighttime listening, but daytime listeninghas some interference. The shortwave reception is average, even though it doesn't cover all the bands. The thing I like most about this radio is that it's easy to carry around.",neutral
"Absolutely fantastic, my recorder stopped formatting my DVD-Ram disks. I had used the recorder approximately 1 yr, After using Maxell's DVD cleaner disk, all is back to normal. Great product even a simpleton can use it, follow on screen instructions and you are home free.",positive
It works for me . It also has a few extras such as audio/video tests . I don't have any complaints .,positive
I purchase Maxell products because they works. Needed to clean the old DVD player. Put the disc in and followed instructions. Simple as that.,positive
"Did exactly as it is advertised. Be aware, however, that there is only one (tiny) brush on the disk. Other brands have a few, or many (if that matters to you). I've always had good luck with Maxell.",positive
"I was about to retire an old standalone DVD recorder, because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs.  I bought this lens cleaner and -- voila! -- the recorder is working again.  Super easy to use (it's simply a DVD that you insert into your machine, and the menus tell you what to do).  Highly recommended.",positive
Works great...For what I'm using it for it works good. I liked the excellent price...I would tell friends about this product.,positive
"It is easy and comfortable to wear, not sure if it was just my product or so is made in general, but the cleaner disc is not fully adjusted to where the optical pickup lens is located (by just two millimeters), and I can not taste good if it fulfills its job well.",neutral
This disc could not be read in either of my DVD players.  Refund requested.  Would not pruchase this item.  Do not buy!,negative
I was in desperate need of a DVD lens cleaner. This is great. I was expecting something with more dust fibers attached. The wispy few fibers manufactured with the disc perform admirably.,positive
"I've had nothing but trouble with Sony DVD players. This one's audio gets out of sync with the picture after the layer switch on dual-layer DVDs. My previous one, Sony's PBD-V30, couldn't play the second layer of any DVD  without skipping. I took that one back and the dealer couldn't get  replacement parts from Sony. I love Sony's design and features, but I  wonder about their quality anymore.",neutral
"Simple to use, compact, one rechargable AA battery lasts more than 12 hours, great quality.  Great value.  I enjoy it everyday.",positive
"Does not work at all on my brand new PC (98se, usb), very bad software, support is helpless... Advertised Audible format is not actually supported ('yet' they say...) Don't buy now... this is a rushed out (though late)  buggy product...",negative
"Not the smallest or best built, but not that bad. I'm not disappointed. That is more than I can say for many MP3 players.",neutral
"The Rio 500 holds a decent amount of music, and the battery lasts longer than I expected. But best of all, it is Mac compatible and the tranfer speed via USB is FAST! If you use SoundJam on your Mac, the interface is right through that application.",positive
"I think that this is one of the most used toys I own.  Great for taking in  my car to have a fresh sound every week. Great for taking for a jog or  working out in the gym (no skipping).  I only wish they included a ac  adapter plug. Plays music smooth and loud, great mp3 player!",positive
"I have a 300 and now a 500. There are a few reasons this unit is a big improvement. Most impt is the USB connection, which makes uploading much faster and is conflict free. The software upgrades easily and the added memory capacity is thus doubled. If you download your songs at very high compression, sound remains good and capacity can exceed 3 hours. One suggestion: get real headphones!",positive
"I have used this model for 8 months and it has plenty of audio and video (including SVideo) inputs.  It can record and play S-VHS and VHS tapes,  with the former providing superior playback using the 2-hours recording  mode and an S-VHS tape.  It auto detects the tape type and has an easy to  use remote.  The best S-VHS machine in this price range.",positive
"Esta camara la he comprado por que puedo grabar todas las fotos en discos flexibles, solo es cargar en el carro una caja de discos y tienes para cientos de fotos, una buena idea de la marca. Me ha gustado mucho y la he disfrutado mucho.",positive
I just got the camera two days ago and have been tinkering with it ever since.  The macro mode alone makes this camera a worthy investment.  I do agree with others that the manual controls are a little tricky but I figure  if you manage to get a good picture then you earned it.  I have not been  disappointed yet by the quality.  Picked up 8 rechargeable batteries and a  64 mb card and I haven't looked back since.,positive
Works just fine,positive
"..this is good labeling tape.I've been using theBrother PT-70 labelerfor a while, and use the black-on-white labels as visual aids on electrical/data cabling connection points and to categorize the contents inside plastic storage containers.You don't really have a choice about the tape you use in any label maker; but this loads easily and stands up to the demands that come from occasional applications in demanding environments.Select with confidence for your PT-70/PT-90 labeler.",positive
I bought this to help label the kids school supplies.  It works great with my p-touch.  I will continue to purchase in the future.,positive
love this and the price of it was good as well.  would definitely buy this for my labeler again. awesome,positive
I use this item at work and its a good product that serves it purpose. i would recommend this item,positive
"The labeler that this fits is easy to use, has a nice selection of style of label, and the print is terrific.  There is a good amount of tape in each dispenser, I think it's a must have for anyone that has quite a few things to label.  The labels stick and stay well.",positive
"These were great! Easy to use, easy to replace, would definitely buy again!These were shipped very quickly and arrived right on time.",positive
Great OEM cartidge for the P Touch.  Makes me file cabinet look professional and the cost is very reasonable.  Highly recommend this!,positive
"It works perfectly. What can I say other than that? The inexpensive Brother PT-80 Personal Labeler (Navy Blue/Green) that this goes with is awesome, so I pay the price for the refills gladly.",positive
"Perfect for your P-Touch label maker. High quality labels with a decent mount of ribbon length for the price. The only hard thing is getting the sticker off of the ribbon paper, would recommend the easy break off ones down the middle if you are willing to pay extra. Overall though a great product for the price.",positive
"I expected this to work seemlesly and it did, so I do not have any complains. Amazon had a great price compared to the local staples., worked well for me.",neutral
"I have used this product for twelve years, I still get impressed how long this tape lasts, and the ink never smudges.",positive
I have 2 P Touch label machines and find the machines and the labels work great. I use them at work and for home use.,positive
"This label cartridge is great. It prints white labels with black ink. I was out of stock and couldn't find them at CVS, Walgreens, or even Officemax. So I bought a few of them in bulk at Amazon.",positive
This replacement labeling tape is for a low end Brother labeler. Amazon had best price and shipped quickly.,positive
used to label was a gift. As far as I know there are no complaints to the item shown above.,neutral
This tape works fine for my label printer. The adhesive holds pretty well. It is not very flexible once you have it stuck on - I would not advise using it for labeling cables unless you use the &#34;flag&#34; method. I have noticed that if you leave the labels on something for an extended period of time it leaves a white residue behind if/when you remove them.,positive
"Label tape works as advertised on Brother PT-90.  Just take the cover off of the back and insert cartridge.  It works wonderfully but I think that it's pretty sad that I paid more for the tape than I did for the whole labeler.  Regardless, I'm still very happy with the product.",positive
Works - prompt delivery - not issues - OEM brother cart - works just fine in my label maker - not sure with whats up with Amazon's posting filters - their trying to tell me my original review couldn't be posted ? - its a great product ! - like what gives ?,positive
What can I say it's the perfect refill and gets the job done!  This comes highly recommended for your brother P-touch labeler,positive
I have an old model P-Touch but it works excellent. I've had it for many years and have never had a problem with it. Glad to still be able to find tape cartridges.,positive
i have a PT-65 and works great - the tape i received is a genuine Brother product.products like these keep you on top of your GTD implementation!,positive
Works great.  Make sure you have the correct size - there are at least 2 different size tapes (M & TZ) and they are not interchangeable.,positive
love this and the silver refills  i see alot of reorders in the future!!!,positive
Brother has hit a home run with their labeling tape systems.I used to spin the old Dynamo labeler to make labels but nomore.,positive
"I just purchased a few of these and it was disappointing that it was half the price of what I paid for the whole unit with a couple of these. Overall, it works as described so I only docked it 1 star for the price.",positive
Official brother M-tape does the job right in the label maker.  Cheaper than all the local office stores.  Organization is priceless.,positive
These cartriges are well build and the tape dispenses smoothly they are a littl;e prices but it does a good job.,positive
"Have a P-Touch Labeler? Have you run out of printing tape? Well, here you go -- just order this and you'll be all set to label until you run out of things to label!",neutral
"Not much to say about label tape other than it works great for my labeler. Label tape is way overpriced, just like ink, so I recommend trying to waste as little as possible.",neutral
"I use these labels and the associated base-model Brother label machine to tag plastic shoe boxes used to sort electronic and mechanical components.  They stick perfectly and stay for a long time (several years now and counting) without peeling up at the corners.  The print is high contrast and retains its color.  All told, a great quality label.",positive
fits in the machine perfectly - just drop it in the space and it automatically starts right up and you can continue whatever it was that you were working on - no muss no fuss,positive
This is the refill for my Touch Labeler and while it may be slightly tricky to replace; you really have to line it up properly; it is ideal and functions just as expected for a refill.,positive
This is the origional just like what came with the machine and it works the same too.  You'll like it.,positive
This is just what you'd expect - a perfect fit replacement for a label maker.  Text comes out sharp and it doesn't jam.,positive
M tape for Brother P-Touch.  Not much to say other than it loaded right into our P-touch Home & Hobby model PT-65 labeler.  Prints fine.,positive
"It just works, it's really trouble-proof. I have no concerns about it and i would recommend it to a friend.",positive
Brother makes good labelers that works and sticks.  This is a convenient model and is useful in everyday labeling.  Not too expensive and stays on the items you apply.,positive
This tape is easy to install and easy to use. It comes off whatever you are adhering it to very nicely and without leaving a residue. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs to organize their life.,positive
Bought this to use for labeling binders and to label how much money remains on gift cards.The ribbon that prints seems to have been sitting on the warehouse shelf for too long. It partially prints each letter/number like some of the ribbon has gotten old and won't stick to the label. I would not recommend this product.,negative
"This spool of replacement tape shipped quickly, fit our Brother P-Touch perfectly and was priced at less than half of what the office store was selling for.  The ink prints black on a white tape face.  These economical replacements allow for labeling with reckless abandon.",positive
I went to Staples at first and found their price to be very high.  Since it is &#34;retail packaged&#34; the produce is the same everywhere so I saved buying here,positive
"** IMPORTANT NOTE: This product also fits theBrother PT-65 Labeler!!! (The description only lists the newer model label-makers.)I love my label-maker and can't imagine life without it. I label Rubbermaid totes, charging cables, A/V equipment, boxes, leftovers for the freezer, etc...and it always sticks to everything...and actually comes off cleanly as well. Just make sure whatever you're labeling is dust/dirt free and you'll be good to go.",positive
"I have used this Brother M231 tape before, and it works fine. It is easy to load and work with.",positive
I love my brother p-touch and this is the normal refill for it. It works just as well as the last one and even holds up in the fridge and the freezer.,positive
I have bought this before. I get at least 4 years of label printing. I print things for my son at school and lots more.,positive
"It fits and works well, it's the original Brother m tape 1/2&#34;. No problems, works just fine, you'll like it.",positive
I've used these labels to do my filing. It's a lot neater and easier to read my files. It's the way to go.,positive
I like having two labelers - the larger Brother P-touch which takes TZ tape cartridges and the smaller brother P-touch which takes M tapes. I've found the lowest price for both tapes is on amazon.com. I keep a red on white tape in one and a black on white tape in the other.,positive
"We have an old Brother P Touch that has been working for years. The only difference between these and the ones you buy at a local retailer, is the price ... much lower at Amazon. We always make purchases that give us the free shipping, to add to the savings.",positive
"arrived in a timely manner, i believe it is oem, works as advertised. i would definitely recommend to any on looking to save money from the big box office stores.",positive
The product arrived in a very short time.  The price was very cheap.  I am extremely satisfied.  I would recommend this company to anyone,positive
Exact factory replacement for my labeler. Amazon Prime does a great job of saving me time and money as well as gas and wear and tear on my vehicle not to mention the frustration of dealing with traffic and not finding what in need at the stores :-),positive
"I am not satisfied with the quality of this product, and I will not recommend this product to others.KK",negative
"I've used the Brother labels machines for years and found them to be reliable.  The supplies are kind of pricey but that's typical for dedicated devices with a captive market.  On this tape, though, I noticed that the 1/2&#34; tape they've sold for years is now .47&#34;  Talk about a chiseler's approach to giving the customer less.",neutral
Was exactly what I needed for my label machine and at a fraction of the cost of what the local stores wanted.,positive
"Does what its intended to, with no pain or suffering, depending on the host unit I imagine.  Recommended highly for whoever needs this particular model.",positive
I ordered this tape for my father.  He's had no complaints.  It's a quality product for half the retail cost.,positive
My Very Old hand tape printer is a relic and tapes hard to find. When you do locate one the cost is more than the device; thus I let this purchase slide for a time until I needed to label something important.,positive
"Works great and this is exactly as described.I like this particular type of tape because1) black on white and high contrast2) Width is perfect for file cabinet folders, and handy for other stuff too3) I can cover up a previous label.  Clear labels you must peel off before putting a new one down.",positive
I love my brother labeler.  I label everything.  Every parts drawer and toolbox drawer.  It's somehow rewarding and creates a sense of calm to create order in one's life.,positive
Needed more tape for the labeler we already had and the new one I just purchased. It always works well and we have never had any issues with them.,positive
I use this for labeling boxes in my workshop. The labels stick and the printed stickers make things look a lot more organized.,positive
"Pricey, but the print holds well, even outdoors in a New England winter. also the cement is durable. Easy to use.",positive
"I love Brother label-makers--they are the easiest to use.  This standard tape is good and has lasted me a long time.  Will not stick on large plastic containers very well, but does fine on smaller containers for holding sugar, coffee, decaf, flour, etc.I wish Brother would make it easier to remove the backing on this labels.  It takes much longer than printing up and printing out the label itself.",positive
Great for labels and its easy and works well all kinds of sizes and dimensions . Labels are nice very nice,positive
"Found my, like, 13 year old label maker lying around one day.  Cleared out the batteries, put new ones in, was stoked that it even powered up.  Pressed &#34;print&#34;, realized that there was no more tape.  Ordered this, now it's back to life.  I should go label the cat.",positive
"I've used this tape for years and have an older Brother labeler to prove it.  Using the tape on clean surfaces is a no-brainer but its not intended to be used on items that have high usage, the printing will eventually wear off, but a new one is easily made up.",positive
"this fits the sample package that came with the label maker.  well, the whole new label maker is like double this, so you pay for the labels.",positive
"I've been using the Brother label printers for many years now, these are pretty good and of course you need tape for it to work, I'm happy with this purchase.",positive
The price on these was excellent. I had shopped around and of course the office supply stores that had them wanted an arm and a leg for one refill. My wife and I love organizing with these little labels.,positive
"Yes, I enjoy labeling things - looks neater for labeling kid gear than a Sharpie does.  (Of course, I do love Name Bubbles for the &#34;serious&#34; kid gear/clothes labeling tasks.  I get frustrated when I am out of labels, and having more color options available through Amazon is a good thing.  Having more label tape is good as my kids find the label printer and start printing random stuff.",positive
"I got my p-touch like 3 years ago for $9.99 from another website. Trying to find the labels is hard and at Office Depot or Office Max or Staples they are expensive.Here, they are fair priced......of course I would have liked them for like $2.99 each but whatever.",positive
"It's a Brother brand tape that I purchased for my Brother P - Touch Labeler. Looks, works, and sticks just like the tape that came with my labeler. And available at less cost than I could find in the local office stores.",positive
this replacement tape was a perfect fit for my brother label machine. it was a lot less expensive then if I bought it in the store.,positive
"Purchasing in quantity is a great way to buy the M-tape for Brother labelers. I have been using a P-Touch for years, and love it. Practically indestructible. The one I have at my office has to be over 10 years old. Just bought a new P-Touch for home, and hope I get the same service from it. Anyway, the Brother replacement tapes have always been reliable, print well, and they are durable.",positive
I use a fair amount of this tape. I tried using this outdoors. That was a mistake. It faded in about 2 days. I sort of knew that would happen. I need to spend the extra money to get the laminated version. As long as you only use it for indoor items it's just fine.,neutral
Excellent product for about 1/2 as much as you would pay at your local office storeBrother M231 1/2-Inch Black on White Tape for P-Touch Labeler,positive
"We use this label maker quite a bit. The refills are first rate. I have not tried the other colors, but the B/W work great",positive
"Excellent all-purpose label maker, & this tape works great in it, not much else to say, except it does the job & the labels work.",positive
And I would also say that the sticky part has the perfect amount of tackiness. I'd be such a slob without my labelmaker.,positive
"I couldn't find this cheaper elsewhere, and the printing on these labels don't seem to fade, nor the stickiness seem to wear off. I only wish they made these with more label and less empty space in the cartridge so I don't have to refill my printer so often.",positive
"I love my P-Touch labeler, and use it all the time.This is a much better price than local on the label refills, so I buy them here.Recommended",positive
"Works well with label printer and is easy enough to use.  Overall, I don't use the system frequently enough to comment.",positive
The Brother M231 1/2-Inch Black on White Tape for P-Touch Labeler is a very good purchase.  I have been using Brother products for years but I especially like this purchase because I can use it for creating files or placing it on the outside of the building for tenant apartments bells so fedex and UPS can locate the tenant for deliveries.  It is a great purchase and I highly recommend it.,positive
"black print on white backing tape. easy to install and prints great labels... no faulty letters, everything comes out printed properly.",positive
"It works as expected. I installed this black on white tape on a Brother P-Touch Model PT-80. The PT-80 labeler is not available anymore, so I was happy to see that the tape is still available. I am very happy.",positive
The P-Touch labeler makes it's easy to label anything.  The quality of the labels are good and work in most situations.,positive
"Works Great for the Brother Personal Labeler Machine, White (PT90)! Just like the original one that came with the labeler and great replacement",positive
I always have my kids peel the back off the tape cause I run out of patience. Otherwise it's fine.,neutral
"This Brother P-Touch labeler is what I needed in a pinch for labeling frozen foods.  Small, lightweight and battery operated with a clear, concise operation interface.",positive
I love my Brother Ptouch labeler and I purchased more to stock up. This labeler has worked well for us and I use it for everything at home.,positive
This cartridge fits well and I've purchased it a few times already. It works well and has no problems. It is authentic and cost effective for our needs: Labeling leftovers in the fridge so that we don't poison ourselves with 2 month old food that should have been thrown out last week.,positive
"I've been using the P-Touch PT-80 for over a year and just ran out of tape. The product works great for labeling files, wires, or anything else.I noticed some reviewers said the tape was hard to peel. The PT-80 has a tape peeler feature (just a little slot) that gets the peel started and works like a champ.",positive
"I use the tape all the time & it works perfect. looks good & stays perfect. I use it to lable files, spice jars, movie titles on the plastic cases. book cases etc.",positive
"I ordered extra tape for the Brother  Personal Handheld Labeler.  Knowing it would be used, the tape was backup for it.",positive
This is an excellent Product. I use my label maker for many different applications. This label maker tape still lasts me for several months.,positive
I have had no problems with this brand. The price was right and the shipping was fast. I highly recommend Prime with the 2 day shipping. I had mine the next day after ordering.,positive
P-Touch Labelers are handy little gadgets that should be in every household. There are all sorts of things that need labels. If you have a P-Touch you will discover the hundreds of things that you never realized would be ever so much better with a label. This black-on-white tape for the P-Touch is the basic label tape that the machine needs to be useful. The tape makes high quality durable glossy labels and works perfectly in the P-Touch machine.,neutral
the tape is good and works perfectly with my labeler.I used to label most of my family's things.It doesn't work very well with objects that need to wash with hot water or will go to microwave. the ink start to fade out.,neutral
"I bought two of these with my brother label maker. I have no complaint, they work as described and overall good price. The writing quality is as expected and they lasts pretty long time for me. 26ft is a lot of labels.",positive
"So far I have not had problems with any of these cartridges,  I have not found a generic alternative to the company's expensive products, but when I do I will change.  These things are just too expensive for what they are.",positive
"The real thing in a Brother package for half the price of store bought.And free shipping.For those that don't know, this is ""crack-back"" tape. Just fold it lengthwise to split the backing and pull it off. No more worrying the edge to get the backing loose. I work with small(2-3 letters) labels, so this really helps.",positive
What I like about this labeling tape is the pre-cut line running along the back of the backing paper. It makes it very easy to remove the label from the backing paper when you're ready to stick the label.I did have one bad experience with loading this labeling tape in the past. The tape jammed upon installation and I had to throw out a new tape. You can avoid this by being careful during tape installation.,positive
I love my Brother label maker and use it in our rental homes. This replacement tape is original Brother (though I have used knock offs and they work perfectly too),positive
I purchased this tape as it is manufactured by Brother. I prefer to use replacements designed by the manufacturer of the product. This tape worked perfectly.,positive
"Good quality product and looks good. One thing though: it has to feed blank tape so you can cut it, resulting in an inch of lost tape for every print.",positive
"I use this 1/2"" tape on all types of surfaces, it sticks well and is easy to read.",positive
"There are nickle/dime items that are necessary, but only on occasion, in life. It is good to have a product and a reliable source when that occasion arises!!",positive
"I use my P-Touch for church name tags, labels in the file cabinet, shop labels, cable labels and more.  This is a great product and I always keep a spare on hand.",positive
"I use this tape most often in the kitchen, to label and date spice jars and pantry items.  The labels adhere well to glass and stainless steel, and do not peel off or yellow with time.  I've also used the labels for a home filing system, and after many years, the labels still look crisp and bright.",positive
These labeling tapes fits my brother label maker perfectly. Also I found that Amazon had the best price for these labels.,positive
"I use this for my Brother PT-1010 and it works great.  No complaints here.  If need a refill, I will buy it here.",positive
"This is a good product ..... fresh, just like in the store, only cheaper. I have never had a problem with any cartridges I've bought from Amazon.",positive
"Just like I've purchased in office supply stores for years, but a great price.  I've been using the tape for several days and works perfectly.  Recommend to anyone.",positive
Just what we were trying to find and couldnt locally.  And the price was so much better than we ever paid before!,positive
This labeling tape is perfect for manila folders or really anything you need to label. It is waterproof and does not come off easily. I use it labeling everything from manila folders to binders to toys!,positive
genuine Brother tapes are the only way to go!  Clean and correct printing each time.  I like this item.  Thanks!,positive
reasonable price ad it works all the time.This product never disappointed me for labeling folders and some asset lists i label them.,positive
Is very difficult to peel the label when finished.  But for the price I guess is ok. If you can buy the original doit.,neutral
Great product.  Very good text.  Backing is very easy to remove and stick labels on to stuff.,positive
"Long time user of Brother Labeler & only beef is the price of the replacement cartridges.  This was a good price, but kinda slow shipping.  Otherwise ok.",positive

"Exact replacement of my original tape, works great for what I use it for. I recommend using this replacement tape.",positive
"The dealer had the lowest price: 1/5th of the local office supply store! Love these labels and use it for LOTS more than just labeling files; there's a quote on my desk to remind me to breathe and focus. A tiny strip of plastic, changing a life in a tiny way.Have my baseballs in plexicases with a clear Brother label on each with name and info. This stuff is genius!",positive
What a deal! I received 3 cartridges of labeling tape with free shipping for LESS than the retail cost of 1 at a B&M store! Free shipping takes a bit longer but that was a choice I was willing to accept.  Product was exactly as what I would expect to receive at a retail store.  I am delighted to get more for my dollar without having to sacrifice on quality. Thanks! Will do business again...and again....and again!!,positive
"Great for labeling clothing by size and season (e.g., size 5 winter) and toy bins (dolls, puppets, cars, etc.) and freezer bags.  Haven't had a label come off yet (I've been use the label make for about a year).  Split backing makes taking the back off SOO much easier.  As for wasting the lead tape, I try to print several items together with one or two spaces between the items and then cut at the end--saves a little.",positive
I am so glad I switched to the Brother label system (specifically the PT9500PC P-touch Label Maker for the Mac). These cartridges are just a fantastic. Not a single Jam since we left Dynmo!,positive
The quality of the product was good I only wish I could order more than one but that is all that was allowed,positive
"The Brother Labeler is a great tool around the house. I use it to label my files, tools, kids items, and many other things. The black on white tape is perfect for any job.",positive
"These, and their corresponding Brother label printer are a great thing to have. From the occasional labeler to the compulsive labeler and organizer, this is great to have.My wife likes to label spices and foodstuffs, I like to label electrical plugs and AV equimpment wires.Very nice to have.",positive
"Well, it's tape, what more is there to say. The TZ231 is Black type on White background, 1/2&quot; in size. This is perfect for labeling DVD cases, or optical discs.",positive
It was good to find these labeling tapes at Amazon...at a good price.  They can be expensive in office supply stores.  Tape was in the original packaging and works fine. These Brother labeling machines come in handy for lots of labeling projects and this one is nice because it prints on clear tape.,positive
Based on price and availability i bought this product. Although never using one previously i felt that this was the right choice for me. It appears well made and easy to use. Finish is good and does what it suppposed to. That was what i wanted. I would recommend to others.,positive
"After I printed a label, I had a hard time peeling the backing off. It came off in ripped-off pieces; leaving some behind.",neutral
Very good tape .... just like I have bought in the store for a higher price! Same good quality & cheaper price through Amazon.,positive
Brother TZ tapes are the most reliable and durable label tapes we've used.  Generic ones just don't cut it.1/2-inch is our most used size.CLEAR is great when you want to use it on colored folders.,positive
"This tape is great!  Very crisp text and very easy to peel off backing and past on to ""things""",positive
I love my Brother Labelmaker and this tape is great. Good value for the amount of tape. I'm label happy and it takes me ages to use up.,positive
As described by seller. Clear tape that when used in the P-Touch printer has black letters on the clear background. Works best on white or light colored surfaces.,positive
"This works well in our P-Touch machine. We use several different sizes and try to be conservative because of the price, but we have not had any problem with the tape getting &#34;old&#34;. We use it inside, outside, in the heat and in the cold and on utensils that go in the dishwasher and it sticks without fail.",positive
I've been using this tape with my labelmaker for years and have been very happy with it. I went to Staples and ofcourse they were out of the black on clear so I went home and ordered on Amazon. I should have done that the first time!,positive
"I bought the brother tape titler machine - very good. It is easier than Avery Labels,  I ordered the tape brother TZ131, I thought it was black on white like the sample roll, it is black on clear. I didn't open it. I would really like to just swap the tape for black on white, but it is a problem dealing with internet exchange purchases, It seems such a hassle. I just put it one side. It sour one.",neutral
"This is a nice tape with limited application. If you want to label a light colored, smooth surface with minimum change to the apperance of the item, this is the tape to use. It would, however, be very difficult to read the black print on a dark surface.",positive
this is a good label. sticks well and stays on. only thing is its hard to peel the back of the tape,positive
"I used this to label my black glasses and items , works as expected and fits what it says it fits",positive
This OEM tape is just as expected and pricing was better than anything local.  We have had nothing but great results with this tape and our Brother labeler.,positive
"Glibness aside, I've actually enjoyed this. It's great for doing small network jobs and keeping cables organized. The cartridge is a bit pricey, but worth it. Sticks and stays stuck till you want it unstuck. Pretty good arrangement.",positive
"My Brother P-Touch labeller is several years old now, and it's getting harder and harder to find the &#34;M&#34; series tapes in stores. I love my labeler, as it works well even in sub-zero temperatures (important for me), so it's great that I can find them on Amazon for an extremely reasonable price, especially with free shipping with Prime.",positive
this is the color and refills i will always reorder it makes the disc look so professional when you mark a disc with it!!!!!! love it!!,positive
This color combo is one of my favorites (the other being Black on Metallic Blue). I've used this type of tape printer for years and love it.,positive
"There is nothing especially important to say about this cartridge. They do their job flawlessly.I use it in my BROTHER model PT-70Brother PT-70 Personal Handheld Labeler with special time & date functionIt works well, lasts long, and provides quality labels.And the price is much better on Amazon.Hope this helps you!",positive
I hadn't realized that Brother made a tape cartridge that features black on gold. It looks great for Christmas labeling! It also works for Halloween.,positive
"If you want to label something so that it stands out from the rest, this is it. These do fit the machine very well.",positive
It fits my labeler.It does the color scheme as advertised.It's the right width.???It's sticky...What all can you say about tape?,positive
This cartridge is by far the best for all your printing needs. The inner tape is thick and clearly sticks to any paper material when the peel off seal is removed. Brother has a nice line of cartridges in various colors so enjoy their products.,positive
works great and sticks ok I use alittle glue on some stuff just to keep the corners from flipping up.,positive
I've been using this method of labeling for quite some time now and I find that it's alot neater than wriring.,positive
This severs its purpose... If you are like me then these things are just for you,positive
"Good price for acceptable yellow label tape used in a Brother P-Touch (PT-90). Will probably buy some more, maybe some red and blue versions next time.",positive
"If you are looking for a simple-to-use, inexepensive labling machine this is the answer.  The price is right and it is very versatile.",positive
Best value anywhere online.  Suits my needs perfectly.  Quality product and excellent price.  Hard to beat that combination anywhere else (online or retail).,positive
"When I used this on nametags, it wasn't quite clear; it was kind of frosty looking. Don't know why unless it was made for Brother and not by them.",neutral
I ordered different widths and colors to mark videotapes for processing.  Some videotapes will be processed at a commercial facility; some I will process myself.  This was I can use color codes to identify which is which.,positive
"It is what it is. It works but when removing the tape months later, it seems to leave residues. I had no problems other wise.",positive
"I use this to label my jellies and perserves for gift-giving.  I use it to label all my homemade, homebaked goods at Christmas time.  Excellent, water-resistant, and easily dresses up a boring jar with the metallic gold tape.",positive
Works great on my label maker.,positive
Works as advertised. I try to be organized & having a labler that is quick & easy to use helps.,positive
"Label things!  Label all the things!  I like having the colors to coordinate with whatever is being labeled -- battery packs, food canisters, pets, and small children.  So buy this, assuming you have a compatible Brother label printer, and embark on a rainbow of happiness.",positive
I love the transparency of this tape and it sticks to a jar or cabinet really well. Fun to use.,positive
I use to but this Black on Clear labeling tape and the old stuff was better for me. The Clear part was really clear - now it's sort of a matte clear but it's OK for most things you put it on.,positive
This tape is a dull matte silver with black lettering - perfect for my application.  Do not expect shiny silver.,positive
The clear tape is great as a way to replace engraving. It does have a gloss like scotch tape and is not quite invisible.,neutral
"I'm replacing a cartridge for my label maker and this is the right color and size, with a reasonable price.",positive
I thought &#34;non - laminated&#34; mean dull surface. It is pretty high gloss. Silver has slight pearl color shift to it. Very nice!,positive
Bought this to go with my old (about 10 years) Brother PT-85 P-Touch labeler. This one is black print on yellow tape to stand out against any color surface. Used it so far to label the drawers on my large rolling tool cabinet; easier than having to open numerous drawers while searching for tools. Fits and works perfectly. Nice to know I can still get these cartridges at a good price for this old printer.,positive
This works perfectly in the Brother PT-70. The color is eye catching and the labels stick very well. Now I want to try the clear.,positive
"I bought the p-touch and wanted some label refills that were black on clear.  this was perfect for me.  Not much to say, but it is what is advertised.",positive
"It is the real deal.  What else can I say.  Well, they want me to say more.  Black on clear is more discrete and less showy.  But then again, black on white is easier to read.",positive
"I like labeling things... boxes so I know what's in them, devices so I know what they're specifically for, warnings etc.  The great thing about this item is that there is no white strip to show what's there.  The clear background works very nicely against the objects own color(s) making the words look like part of the original.",positive
"I use my printer a lot, and this tape (Brother M131 Black on Clear 0.47in X 26.2ft ) was priced right.",positive
"I use this on my motorcycle to listen in on the road captain's conversations while tripping down the road with the HOGS. It works very well, especially as a simple monitor, and the &#34;channel switching - swapping&#34; is handy since they change from  22 to 25 and don't tell anyone. Compact - nice package.",positive
"Flexibility comes at a cost in performance and this is no exception. Good product, put together nicely and has tons of features. Minor annoyances: the clip behind the radio is not the best feature, the LCD light does not stay on long enough, and the speaker volume should be louder. Lots of upsides (well covered in other reviews) with some minor but annoying downsides.",positive
I use this in the car when driving long distances through major metropolitan areas - listen to the truckers discuss road conditions.  I can hear pretty good with this.  Talk power may be limited - even though I've got a good roof K40 antenna with a good SWS.  Acess to squelch and volume is is a little trickly while driving.  I wish this unit had adaptive squelch so that I don't need to constantly fiddle with it.,positive
I got this for camping in the boonies. I got the antenna to increase the range. It works well. Good for weather reports in the area.,positive
"I use this compact CB while traveling and it work just fine, it is small and with the cigarette plug option, I don't have to worry about batteries.",positive
"I used this radio on 2000 mile 4 day trip on my harley and worked good the whole time, keep in mind though it only has a 4 watt output so range is lacking compaired to the other bikes i was with.",positive
I got this and the cobra Antenna. This thing does not pick up hardly anything I am not sure its even working. I can pick up the weather radio but everything else seems to be crap. I am sending this back NOT HAPPY. It's a good idea but it don't work,negative
"Excellent value. Works great, easy to learn/operate. I have not used a CB Radio in years, so was impressed by the scan feature. 3 ways to power it, and auto adapter comes with external antenna connector, no need to buy adapter. Control buttons located handily, easy to navigate. Can recommend.",positive
A nice little small radio that works well and and it took minimal effort to hook it up in our vehicle.,positive
"Product is solid. The plug-in/portable battery clip on is great along with the ability to plug into an antenna like a lil Wil.Reception is not great, a couple miles, but typical unless you plug into an antenna, again typical. full scan and 9/19 scan is a solid feature.Nothing amazing about it, nothing bad about it. Great back up when cell service is not available.",positive
"Don't get me wrong as a handheld as long as your not close to any RFI source ,it's ok. But in my car...A 2005 cobalt ...its worthlessI spent extra money on a magnetic antenna, tried chokes and even bought a noise clipper, nothing made a difference. Then I tried the cheapest uniden handheld CB radio that I had under the same circumstances with the same equipment....antenna...etc.....and guess what no noise. So my advice ....buy a uniden Radio",negative
the bad news is these things had their hay day in the 70's  I purchased the one above and im happy with it....But.....there is literally nobody on them anymore!!! maybe some people near a major interstate but thats it....Great if your on an interstate all the time but other than that not so much....but a really nice radio!,positive
while I have ham/CB equipment in my cars/car--I really like to have in my most recent car nothing 'installed' and permanent (for now) thanks for a great product!,positive
I use it with my mobile unit to keep in contact with the others when we go in the mountains to go rock hounding use mobile for the base unit,positive
I have purchased two of these radios and they work great! When we go camping the wife uses one to communicate with me when we are backing up our fifth wheel camper.,positive
The only reason I did not give 5 stars was the lack of SSB on this unit. Otherwise is is exactly what I have been looking  for. Newer trucks don;t have all the extra room to mount toys like the older trucks did so this fits right on in.,positive
"I use this with my Lil' will on my BMW 325iS mainly to talk with truckers about speed traps on longer trips, the unit has very good circuitry for how small it is, and it leaves basically nothing to be desired except I wish there was an option to leave the screen backlighting on.great little unit!",positive
"Used it for a couple of months and decided to switch to a VHF radio. Reach is minimal, even two cars driving next to each other doesn't allow for good communication. Go for a talkabout if you look for something simple or a VHF if you want long distance good quality communication.",negative
"Great design for use in any vehicle since it offers flexibility in mounting and connecting options and additionally allows for it to be used as a portable, ie. walkie-talkie.",positive
"Nice portable CB! Full 4 watt power and weather channels.Has a extra battery pack and I NEVER thought I'd use the phrase: ""batteries NOT included"".You can plug it into the car 12VDC socket and use it with an external antenna, again NOT included. EZ 7-9 mile range with a decent antenna. About 2 mile range with the little antenna that comes with it.Worth the price!",positive
"I'm neither thrilled nor disappointed with this purchase.  For the price, it seems to work well.  Plug it in, press the button, and talk.  People sometimes talk back.  It works.",neutral
"I should have listened to everyone else reviewing this product.  Handhelds, including this one, are pretty useless without an external antenna.  Perhaps it was defective, but this one wouldn't even pick up a broadcast 50' in front of my truck.  Nonetheless, this would be a great value if it worked.  It includes a cigarette lighter adapter and two battery compartments.",negative
This cb is nice money well spent I. Will love using this unit it come with all you need to start with .,positive
"Used it on motorcycle while on a 130 mile trip. Bought the 22540 headset, broke off the headband, and inserted the speaker in helmet. Mic worked well until we hit TS Andrea and it got too wet to understand. Will be using in car too",positive
"I returned this item, I found an older production year so I could do the channel mods I wanted, I love the radio, the fact that it can be both a mobile and hand held has corba beat hands down.",neutral
Nice small unit. The range isn't that great but it picks up the weather stations. Fits right in the glove box.,positive
"Nice Unit, has weather band too.  Good range for small unit.  Use on bikes to chat to other riders.",positive
It's a nice little unit to test out my motorcycle CB.  It has all the right accesseries & performed as expected. Not so good in high traffic areas.,positive
"this radio is just great.I purchased this product from Amazon when Midland first came out with this radio.Back in 08 or 10.Have not had a single issue with the radio. It works great, has wonderful shortcut buttons,and in my own thought, much better than the version that Cobra has.Only downside is that the back light does not stay on. but from there on, its great.",positive
"The radio works as advertised and I enjoy it very much.  The main reason I ordered it was because you can use it as a portable radio and as an in-auto cb.  With the external whip antenna it works excellent in the truck.  It also is a good price. If you read the specs and know what you are ordering, then you will not be sorry.",positive
"Nice radio that does everything I need it to do. Coupled with a Jeep mounted 4ft Firestik, the range is better than expected. Would highly recommend this CB.",positive
"I took this little unit on my BMW motorcycle for a 2800 mile spin.  Worked the whole time, even when we were getting rained on.  It didn't really say anything about being water proof, but did OK in light rain.  Buttons were a little small for my gloves, but I don't think this unit was design with Motorcycles in mind.",positive
Purchased this radio as a hold over until I mounted my other radio in the truck.  Worked fine.  Speaker is kinda small so hard to hear at times with the windows down.,positive
Works great. I pretty only use it out on the trail when I'm wheelin. I installed a 4' antenna gets much better reception and range. I like it because I can take it out when I'm done so less chance of someone stealing it. Also very easy to use,positive
CB radio is what every trucker needs and this one did me just fine. Like it a lot. Just don't understand why I need to write 20 characters about the product.,positive
"The discription sounded good but after I bought it and put it to use, I found it to be ""not as advertised"" and returned it.",negative
"Defective unit, scan function worked 1 out of 30. Battery trays are very poorly made. The eight battery compartment would not power the unit. If the unit was working as designed I would have great concern for the longevity of the battery holders. As they were not straight in the compartments with slight alignment issues. Audio was acceptable and it did bring in the NOAA clearly.",negative
"we have a travel trailer and needed a cb radio, which turned out to be hard to find ANYWHERE other than online.  with that said this is a great little tool and we are very happy with the purchase.  i can't speak to how it compares with others since the last cb my husband and i had any contact with was back in the 70's so in that regard this little number is quite an improvement.  :)",positive
"I purchased this because of how compact it was however I barely got a 50 foot range with it. I asked the local CB repair shop if there was anything I could do to fix the range on it, they said get a real CB, the compact all in one handset units are not worth it.",negative
"Cool little radio,  transmits very well,  but reception is very poor. low volume and what seems to be high level of background hum on receive.  Not sure if i can live with it.  Will come back and revise with full eval later.",neutral
I really like this CB. It has the ability to transmit quite well with a dedicated whip. If you like this sort of thing like I do you will really enjoy its compact size and features. Technology is a trip.,positive
"I needed a CB for when I go off-roading.  After a lot of research, I bought this radio.  In conjunction with a 4' Firefly antenna and a few minutes with an SWR meter, I can send and receive as far as I need to.",positive
I gave this as a gift that was well-received. I have been told that it works great and is appreciated.,positive
"As a backup for when you are traveling in areas with spotty cellphone coverage this is a nice to have device. Also, listening to drivers is entertaining (unless you are offended by blue language...)Well made, switches into hand portable format in seconds. great range with a vehicle antenna.",positive
I bought this and sent it back almost immediately. It felt really flimsy and the battery pack seemed like a toy.,negative
This is a small CB it works good and has some nice features.  I would recommend this product if you are looking for a versatile handheld CB.,positive
"I have had this radio for about one month now. The speaker stopped working.  I had to buy an external speaker. I saw several complaints about the same issue when I was researching the radio. However, the radio still transmits very well and receives well also. I continue to recommend it but I suggest purchasing an external speaker when you buy the radio.",positive
This unit fills a niche for those who want basic CB capabilities in a convenient and flexible form. This is not for people who want great range or will rely on for emergency use.,positive
First it's not a big trucker radio it's more your nosey and want to listen in and get weather OR you mudding with friends and u need to be in communication for that its great or on a 4 wheeler,positive
"I love this raidio, it worked so good, i had to come back to buy a second!  I was leaning toward a cobra, with some reservations, and when i saw this one, it was the clear winner.",positive
"Can be used as either a handheld unit or a permanent install.  Great value as it comes with a battery back for regular AA, a rechargeable battery pack for rechargeable AA's and the vehicle mounted cable for power and signal.",positive
I bought this CB radio for my Jeep.  I use it when I am wheeling with my Jeepin' buddies and it works very well.  I like how I can plug it into my Jeep cig lighter or snap on the mobile battery pack and take it on the go.,positive
"I really don.t care for CB's but I do drive a lot and this one has saved me a lot of time and money.  Hard to believe that you can get everything you need built in to the mic without having to mount a permanent unit under your dash.  Easily moved from car to car without tools and trouble, I highly recommend this to anyone needing a CB",positive
Purchased this cb from Best Buy.  It would not work with batteries or the power source in the vehicle.  Most difficult to get the battery pack open and off the cb in the beginning but once I made a call to the company I figured out that you must mash a button and slide the battery pack off the cb.  After going through that it didn't work.  I am sending it back and will not be reordering.,negative
"I can't tell how well it works because I have yet to receive any voice on any channel, and I live within sight of one of the most-heavily-travelled interstate highways by 18-wheelers.  Maybe reception will improve once it's mounted on my truck with a better antenna - it couldn't get any worse.",neutral
Ok - my first CB... I love this thing... so far so good. Good quality and looks durable. I did go buy an external antenna to boost reception ($15). I'll be testing this more this weekend when I go off-roading with a buddy and his CB. I recommend this.,positive
"Killer Compact CB for motorcycle or any vehicle.  Even if you rarely have need for emergency roadside communication this radio has options that exceed many full size CB radios. Mujltiple freq scanning and programmable favorites.  instant access to the channels you follow. Compact, portable and simple to use.",positive
No space in Yukon so just what I needed. Purchased an external speaker so works just like the big boys except for a little less range,positive
"Great radio. I bought with to be portable. Has the ability to plug in the cig lighter or use batteries. Also can plug in an antenna if you want. Range is short with the stubby, but that is to be expected. Love that is has the scan feature and weather. For the price it's hard to beat.",positive
I purchased this unit for a road trip cross-country. I was very disappointed with the quality. If I could return it at this point I would. Range is less than 1000 feet without an external antenna mounted to the vehicle. I've had other handhelds in the past with much better reception.,negative
"Installed this in my 4x4, fits entirely in the center console when I'm not using it. With a 3' Firestik antenna I've had conversations with base stations 20 miles away. Overall love it for being compact and versatile.",positive
"This packs a lot of features for a decent price. The different power options are great. If you are going to use it for distances farther than car to car, you NEED a bigger antennae or a roof top one",positive
Worked as expected. Easy to setup using and following instructions. Use it every day. Its a little long but works fine.,positive
"This antenna isn't going to provide great range or performance, but it works OK in situations where you can't easily hard wire a CB antenna.  I installed it on my travel trailer window, to avoid drilling a hole in the roof or exterior wall. Works fine for short range CB communications in the campground, which is all I wanted to begin with.",positive
No way to set the SWR and an operating range of only a couple car lengths made me regret this purchase.,negative
Works real nice no trouble with the set screw to hold the antenna in place also has instructions on setting it,positive
The antenna was sturdily made and was a better quality than the one I was replacing. The connection points were well thought out to allow ease of installation.,positive
"I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio.  Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that.  On a positive note, it was very simple to install.",negative
"This thing does not work.If you buy it you will throw it away, swr's are always high, and can not be set, it may look cool but that is all it has going fo it.",negative
"The ETX-90EC has magnification of 48X; great for looking at the moon. However, if you want to look at any planets or stars, you _definitely_ need the optional eyepieces so you can have some control over magnification.  Without these optional eyepieces, you have no control over magnification.",neutral
"These are amazing little locks. I bought 3 of these to help deter people from taking my computers. These will not prevent someone that is motivated to steal it, but it will help to prevent someone from just picking it up and walking away with it when you are not looking.",positive
All the stores around here were selling pathetic combo locks I had to return.  This works great.,positive
"Works great - use on an imac computer used for guests in a hotel lobby... so far so good, and it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb...",positive
This computer lock works great with my laptop. The key takes some trial and error to be turned correctly but it all works out in the end.,positive
It's not rocket science to make a well functioning laptop lock.  And this one works really well if you (like me) prefer a key over a combo lock.  I only gave it a 4 because the first one that I ordered came with the wrong keys and I had to get a replacement.,positive
"This notebook lock and security cable is just that, it works well and has never failed.  The one thing to remember is not to lose any of the two keys provided.",positive
"The concept and the quality of the product leads me to believe it will work, when needed. It is easy to use, with part wrapped around a stationary object, and the other end entrenched in the computer. Someone trying to steal the computer will break the case if the cable is attached. The cable appears to be heavy duty, and a large pair of nippers would be needed to cut it.",positive
"Nothing sucks more than when you are sipping on some tea studying at a coffee shop and you need to go pee.  However, you don't want to leave your lab top unattended.  Thank god I now have this cable to secure my investment.  Its lightweight and convenient.",positive
"You'll always have your power cable with your notebook.  What about another cable that helps with security.Leave your laptop alone. It's going to be safe.  I use it on my office, college and even home so nobody is going to move it from its place.If still paranoic, try the Kensington Soniclock Motion Detecting Alarm.  Just like the alarm in your car. Both great security tools.",positive
This is an excellent security cable. Long enough to allow one to secure your laptop to something large or fixed to the room construction. I bought this one to replace one that I had a few years ago (my wife abducted it).On my MacBook pro the key-hole for the cable is on the right hand side. The lock works smoothly and reliably.Dr Z.,positive
"Works great, but very obvious! Does the job we are asking it to do, with no complaints.  Great that it has two keys.",positive
Was on my way to a trade show and worried my laptop might leave me for another.The Kensington did the job.,positive
Locks up nicely to any stationary object. Keeps laptop secure from random hands picking it up and taking it. Long enough to secure it and still have freedom to move it around the desk.,positive
"Product seems well made, although you can't stop anyone who is determined to bring the necessary tools to cut the cable. Hopefully it will slow someone down, or at least keep an honest person honest.",positive
I got mine at a 2nd hand store for a buck and I love it but it does take some wiggling to get out,positive
Fits like a glove and very streamline. Works perfectly and keeps your computer safer from the stealing  temptation of others.,positive
"Kensington is the best, price is good, the lock is easy and works smoothly.  Another great product from Kensington!",positive
Locks the laptop to a table or a bar or whatever you wrap the cable around. Secure and reliable lockset.,positive
My daughter used this at school for her computer and it works so well best money I've spent on college,positive
"I make sure to lock my Laptop up whenever i may be away from it for a long period of time. This lock is very sturdy and quick to enable/disable. Its portable, so I can take it with me on vacation to secure my laptop where ever I am.",positive
"I thought I was buying the Kensington 64068 but what I received from Amazon was a discontinued 64084 commercial model with an ""HP approved"" logo on the box and black HP-branded keys.  It works Ok but looks cheaper than the model in the illustration.  It's not worth the trouble of returning but I feel somewhat cheated since I saw an identical unit on eBay [...].",neutral
"Works well on my 27 inch iMac. It's secure enough for sure, but the attachment isn't tight against the computer. it has some jiggle room. doesn't look like this effects the security factor though.",positive
I got this lock and the quality was great but it didn't fit. The lock was too wide to fit in the Kensington lock slot on my Macbook Pro. It scratched everything up and then I quit trying. Don't get this lock.,negative
Very easy to use on my Dell Inpsiron laptop.  Locks securely to the docking station or to the laptop.  No complaints.,positive
Used for laptop at Senior Center so no-one could leave with it.  It was easy to install on laptop and put thru cable hole on desk for security of the laptop.,positive
"I bought this cord to deter people from waltzing off with my work laptop. It feels and looks good and sturdy, and doesn't have any obvious glitches or defects, so it's doing there job well in that respect. It is a bit bulky, which works for my work computer (which is ~1&#34; thick at the hinge), but it wouldn't be suitable for my newer ultrabook.",positive
"I admit I don't take this everywhere- I only have it for when I really need it, but in those cases, it works like it should. I use it for my Macbook Pro 13' (2009, and I'm pretty happy with it.",positive
"It does just what it says it'll do: if your PC has a locking slot (almost all do now) and the place where you're working has a secure piece of hardware to secure it the airplane-grade cable (schools, libraries, airports, et. al.), all would-be casual thieves will move on. As for more determined thieves, that's perhaps another story. Back up your data!",positive
The lock arrived early and did what it is suppose to do.  It is easy to install and comes with a velcro strip to wrap up the cord when not in use.  Good overall product.,positive
"It won't stop somebody with the right cutting tool, but deters random theft when attached. Good product.",positive
"It works on my iMac 27&#34;, but the directions didn't help.  It would seem intuitive to just shove it in the computer's rectangular hole made for the lock.  It did, though, require a lot of fidgeting to get it inserted.  I had to hold the barrel from spinning and insert the lock at the same time...very frustrating.  But, it is on now.",positive
"So it took me a few minutes to figure out how to line up the little pins and the head thingy.  Once I had that under control, this works just fine.  Inserts and removes easily and the cord doesn't get in the way.  Just goes about its business and does what it is supposed to do.",positive
"Durable comes to mind when receiving this product. Easy to install and uninstall. For the price a most have, and a great buy.",positive
Works as advertised. The lock can seem a bit finicky until you learn how to lock it right. It works great.,positive
"I bought 3 of these this year,  I guess out of habit.  They seem a bit loose where they plug to the slot, but maybe that's normal.  It didn't keep me from buying 2 more of them.",positive
"I have been using one of these for a few years and just bought another one for my brother. It's more of a theft deterrent than a theft prevention product. If somebody really wanted to cut the cable or rip the lock out, I'm sure they could. But, it would be easier just steal the laptop right next to it with no lock. That's the reason I use it.",positive
"It was easy to connect this to the laptop.  No code to share or remember.  If you know where the keys are, you also know who has access.",positive
Appears to be sturdy and function as intended.  No issues.  It will work with a Targus PA400P Defcon security baseplate (but &#34;threading the needle&#34; is a bit tight).,positive
"The track ball often slips by the sensors on the mouse, causing it to not pick up certain motions. There are better track ball mice out there.",negative
"I ORDERED THIS AND USED IT FOR 1 MONTH, THEN IT STOPPED WORKING ALL TOGETHER.I NOW AM WITHOUT A TRACK BALL.",negative
"and then it moves erratically, or will only go sideways...drives me nuts. I will get the Expert Mouse trackball. Wish they had an optic one",negative
I went to the store and tried a lot of these; this is the most comfortable one to me.  Plug & play. easy to use.  PS2 or USB.,positive
It is not the best mouse but you get used to it.,positive
"I think this is a good product if you plan to use it as intended. those that have incompatible graphics cards will run into serious problems, but otherwise this is a great product that gets the job done.",positive
"I used this speaker set for more than half a year now, and it served me great.  The sound quality is good (don't expect hi-fi quality sound, of course).  The sub-woofer is sounds great, too.  At the back it can accept 2 line input, so I can connect my 2 PC to the same box w/o problem.  Generally, it is a very good computer speaker.",positive
"I have this 3-pieces set, cost me 69.99 b4 rebate, once I set up and play on my CD walkman first, yes! this is a good set for the price, deep, no boomy bass, clear mid and treble, but somehow the mid-high sounds a little bit awfulthis set is much better than any 3-peices set I had till I got JVC desktop stereo+Sony woofer, then I gave away, and they says this speaker set sounds very good",positive
"I use it to convert old tapes to CD (via computer), as well as playing CDs and cassettes on it. Having the two media in one unit is a real space saver and convenient, too. The mechanicals and sound performance are excellent. Headphones port with its own vol. contol a nice feature. Thanks, Teac.",positive
Hard to find a cd / cassette deck combination in this day.  Seems to be the best price for the unit.,positive
I bought this to transfer old cassettes to disc. It has been a wonder to work with. I have found nothing that doesn't work beyond expectations. With the auto-reverse I just start it up and copy the whole tape to pc in no time at all. Playback on the cassette deck is great.,positive
great if you need this to type of unit and still play your old cassettes. Also useful if you want to transfer your cassettes to CDs or DVDs.,positive
"After owning a Teac tape recorder since 1983 that I was very happy with, I wanted a second one so I purchased this unit. What a dissapointment. It cliked and clanked when the tape engaged. It didn't have a earphone jack--my fault, I should have looked closer. After a couple weeks of use it wouldn't accept the audio feed in order to record so I returned it.",negative
"Bought this unit based on reviews listed here--have not been disappointed.  Nice unit, easy to use and of seemingly good quality.  Happy customer!",positive
After having read all the glowing reviews I purchased this item and was not disappointed.  This is a very nice full quality function CD player.  I have been very pleased with this item and its performance.,positive
"I have had this unit for a little over a year, using it infrequently. It started having problems playing some tracks on even new CDs, and now it won't play anything.",negative
"If you want a multi-CD changer drive/player for your home (separate component) stereo system, this is a good choice.  Mine works flawlessly and has good sound qualities. It closely matches my older (non-JVC) RCVR/AMP unit in size and looks.  It is not portable though and takes up a fair amount of cabinet space but for the money, this is a good deal IMHO.",positive
"i am pleased with this cd player, after searching thru best buy and circuit city it was a welcome relief to find a product i really wanted.",positive
Sound quality is excellent for the price and it is very easy to use; I highly recommend this player.,positive
"I love this changer, it does everything I want it to do. It can do random playing as well as straight forward and continuous play which means I can listen to a variety of music for hours.",positive
"It seems to work fine, If you're having issues with your VCR playback and recording quality, this is the answer.",positive
"My Fiancee and I have many, many, VHS and DVD movies.  Here VHS player started messing up, so we went to store after store looking for a cleaning tape. Finally ordered two cleaning tapes online. both work great.",positive
"I have a temperamental DVD player. I ordered this dry head cleaner, because it is so temperamental about what we use in it.",positive
Just as advertised. Arrived quickly.  Seems to have fixed the tracking problem on a veryold VCR with many hours use.,positive
This is very convenient to use but the wet cleaner works better. Simple to use and can be used multiple times.,neutral
The tape video head cleaner works as expected. Very good product. I recommend it for those who want to keep their old VHS equipment.,positive
put this tape and just push play and it cleans your vcr.  My tv/vcr combo is an old model that I found free on the road side  which had a fuzzy playback mode and and the voice was almost nonexistent.  After playing the tape twice I now have a crystal clear picture and a normal voice on the  vcr playback!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
I just can't fathom how a dry tape can clean all that well. I also wonder how this can clean the record heads being that it never has you press the record button (probably doesn't clean the record heads is my guess) However it is by far the simplest to use! Even my Mom could do it! That's got to be worth something. I think I'll give it to my Mom!,positive
Most of us have old VHS tapes in the closet and the VP-100 keeps your VCR delievering a clean image.What more can I say---it works!,positive
This are so useless they dont clean the vcr perfectly and you can clean a vcr yourself for free!!!!!! the only reason you should use this is if you have one of those tv vcr combos those you cannot clean yourself,negative
"This product is made in China and runs for ten seconds one cycle at a time with automatic rewind and no sound or video accompanying.  This product is not like the previous head cleaner which had four cycles of aproximately two minutes each with a sound and video format.  I liked the original product much, much better - not happy. Try to find Maxell SKU: 290058, UPC: 025215290053, to see if it does the job.",negative
I use my VCR for high quality audio recordings. This cleaner does a great job of cleaning up the slight noise I get when tape heads start to get dirty. Highly recommended.,positive
"Terrible product.  The older version (with the same model number) was excellentAll this one does is jam in the machine.no cleaning video, no cleaningbuzzes for a few seconds and jams.I bought 2, both had exact same problem.",negative
"Like several other reviewers, the product ruined the picture.  I read some comments on other negative reviews and can say that there were no other variables at play in my case.  There appears to be very poor quality control on these and buyer beware.  The product I received destroyed the picture and I am hoping another product will be able to fix the VCR.Addendum: Another head cleaner returned the picture except for color distortion in one stripe.",negative
I put the tape in and it immediately turned off my vcr and ejected the tape. I tried again and the same thing happened. I tried it in another vcr and the same thing happened. Amazon gave me a full refund.,negative
I use both a Wet and Dry VHS head cleaner so this product goes well with the Maxell Wet Head Cleaner.,positive
Amazon is sending a replacement.  Unfortunately mine arrived damaged and I had to return it.  They say Dry Tape Head Cleaner's are better than wet.  Maxwell has been in VHS and cassettes for awhile so I imagine it will be worth the investment. I'm hoping to download my video collection on DVD.  So it will get much use!,neutral
This is an absolutely amazing product. Twice it has made a VCR that is at least 10 years old go from unusable to working like a charm. It has certainly kept us from throwing out our VCR. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to get more life out of their VCR.,positive
"This product I'm sure works in some cases but in the case of my VHS cleaning job, it did not work. It did improve the picture but did not completely fix the picture. I gave it 3 stars rather than one star because I don't know if a wet VHS head cleaner would have done the job better and I made a poor selection or if the VHS is failing in a different way.",neutral
It sort of works.  It worked in one vcr fine.  I didn't seem to work in the other one.  Iffy.,positive
It works clean and prefect. What else can be said but get it.,positive
This is okay.  But I prefer one that has a message that shows it is working. I still like to tape some shows and find it hard to find a cleaner that does have a message instead of just &#34;noise&#34; showing.,positive
This is quickly becoming a very hard to get item since vcr's are now few and far between.This item is almost non-existent in stores.It does the job it was made for.You can't ask for anything more.,positive
"I've been digitizing a lot of family movies, videos, etc., and it is very important that the VHS player I've been using has clean heads. We manually cleaned the heads when we started, but I purchased this to clean them intermittently during this very long process. The VHS player is running our tapes through very crisp and clear. I believe it's doing what it's supposed to do.",positive
This is an excillent head cleaner. There are visual graphics on the tape that talk you through the process & you get a little chart that you can stick on the tape case which shows that you can get 100 uses out of it. Then just toss it out & replace it. This cleaner really improves the A/V quality on a VCR.,positive
"I purchased this for a friend and they absolutely loved it.  Based upon that, I strongly support anyone's decision to give this product a try.",positive
"Received the head cleaner on time. Worked as expected, although the actual cleaning time was less than 20 seconds, as stated in the instructions.",positive
I have a panasonic tv with built in VCR.  VCR doesn't work and tapes were getting stuck.  I thought/hoped this would do the trick.  It didn't help.  I will try to use it on my other VCRs.  Maybe they need some help before they go bad too.,neutral
I have 2 of these and neither one works in the 2 different VCRs I have.  They make the screen worse.  I then use my old style Maxell cleaning tape to fix the picture!  How can I get the old style Maxell VCR cleaner?,negative
I have an old VCR that was getting quite dirty and this did the trick at cleaning the heads.  They are getting harder and harder to find but I'm glad I finally found this one to purchase.,positive
"Tried this in my Sony, JVC, Magnavox and Panasonic VHS VCR's and it does not work properly on any of them.The cleaner tape stops at various periods of time and never completes a cleaning cycle.  It is intermittent at best.Don't wast your money.",negative
"Man oh man,,,I stuck this sucker in  really less than 2 sec's later it was done...so I thought nah nothing is ever going to clean my dirty heads of my old VHS player tv combo..................................but how wrong I was...as I did it again just to be sure...and less than 2 sec's later....done !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...so either dry VHS cleaners are better than the wet type or I and I alone got a magic special cleaner for my tv/vhs combo.............",positive
"I put this in my VCR and it turns off the VCR.  I've tried everything.  It runs VCR tapes fine, but when I put the Maxell Head Cleaner cassette in, it turns the VCR off.  Then when I turn the VCR back on, it ejects the tape.",negative
Easy to use.  I would recommend this product over other products.  It was cheaper online than it was at the store.,positive
"I purchased this for my DVD/VCR converter combo. The product is working just fine. I haven't had an opportunity to use it a lot, but that's a good thing, right?",positive
"Never thought I'd be needing one of these again. In fact, what is a VCR?Anyway, my Disney movies were crackly and the screen was fuzzy. Ran this puppy through and they were like new again.",positive
"I don't know why these outdoor speakers were so cheap; they replaced much larger speakers that eventually gave it up to the weather conditions, but the sound is even better. They are powered with a standard 50-watt Sonos receiver/amplifier unit, and still sound teriffic.  In fact, I like them so much that I'll probably take them down for the winter, to avoid having to replace them in a few years.",positive
"For the cheap cheap price, these speakers work as good as needed and sound decent.  They do what they need to do and did I say they were cheap?!",positive
"I bought these to mount under my deck for some outdoor tunes and they work great!  Sure they don't have the deep bass that you might expect from expensive indoor speakers, but at this price they do they job perfectly.  They have already been through several rain storms here in Georgia and continue to work fine.  Highly recommended!",positive
THESE SPEAKERS ARE GREAT!  THE HAVE HIGH QUALITY SOUND AND WORKED GREAT FOR MY COMPUTERS EXTERNAL SPEAKERS.  I LOVE THE QUALITY WHEN LISTENING TO MY CD'S,positive
"I mounted them under my eaves and they work great.  I thought because they were so cheap that the sound would be cheap, but they sound great and have worked fine after a few rain storms.",positive
They do a good job. I put them below my deck and they have worked very wellfor two years. Great sound. I would buy them again. Great bargain for the price.,positive
"I bought these after reading reviews .I don't think they sound as good as some said they did.However I am satisfied with them for what I use them for ,background music on patio.For the money I didn't expect Bose quality.",positive
"dollar for dollar these are hard to beat !! every body was right about the brackets ,they are a little weakly made. mine are mounted inside our camper in the upper corners of the bedroom and sound much better than the old ceiling speakers.will buy another pair for the living area to replace the other pair of ceiling speakers out there. are a nice size for space avaiable.",positive
"For a cheap pair of outdoor speakers these sound better than the price warrants, and lasted longer than I expected.",positive
"I put this pair of speakers outside on the right side of my garage facing my backyard....and boy does it produce nice sound.  I placed it up under the roofline so it would stay a little drier.  I live in rainy Houston, we have had 4 or 5 heavy rainstorms and the speakers are still working just fine.  This pair was a great price, arrived very quickly, and sounds just fine.  Buy it and save money.",positive
"I bought this model because it was cheaper than the Sparkplug model in white with an L-shaped plug. Well, the straightness of the plug couldn't withstand normal use, and the audio stopped working because the junction between the wire and the hard part of the plug probably got bent back and forth too much. Good sound and sound-blocking, but not durable if you plan to move your MP3 player in and out of your pocket.",negative
"Beautifully soft and comfortable, cone-shaped earphones, and the only ones I've ever found that don't keep falling out of my ears like earbuds do. Good sound quality, and excellent price, with the superb Koss reputation behind them.",positive
The headphones look better than older Koss Sparkplug but the sound quality is much worse.,neutral
"These are awesome.  Best $13 headphones I've ever heard, and they cut out the dull roar of trains/cars/computers/coworkers almost entirely!  I truly wonderful product, and Amazon had them in my hands in 24 hours!  I'm just so, so pleased... :-)",positive
"I wanted to try these because I use my mp3 player in noisy environments, and they were supposed to be able to fit tightly into your ears and block the outside noise.  Well, I never was able to use them and finaly gave up on themn. I tried many times to squeeze the foam and hoped that they would mold to the shape of my ears, but it was never satisfactory.  I found them very uncomfortable.",negative
"I kid you not. Decided to splurge (over $300) on a super set of earphones for my ipod from Shure and hated them and sent them back. Then I tried these as a temporary solution and found them actually vastly superior in sound, aesthetics and discrete form. I simply love them. As a frequent traveller, I appreciate not hearing the usual yada yada on the airplane. Highly recommend them.",positive
these plugs easily fall out regardless of what one of the three foam pieces you use. They are uncomfortable and hard to insert even if you follow the directions and suggestions here. I recommend the sony in earphones about $25,negative
Very comfortable. great tone and bass sounds. sound isolations is great!!!they are very affordable and i definitely recommend these for anyone who is looking for a great buy.,positive
"These weren't as good as I'd hoped. When I put them in, it made my music too loud, the least thing they fell out, generally they did not work for me.",negative
"i found them uncomfortable for long use.  i took the spongy parts off the ends and cut the tips off some other earplugs i have so the sound could travel through and that works well, only because it keeps the purple/silver part away from my ear cartillage.  that part is rather large and they won't go far enough into my ear to stay there comfortably.  they'll work but my search isn't over.",neutral
"At this price point, you're not going to find a better pair of reasonably durable earbuds with this quality of sound or noise-canceling ability. I'd say that I've gone through a pair every few years, and I'll continue to buy these as needed. They block some sound, the sound quality is fine, and you won't be devastated when you realize that you've forgotten them on the plane and need to buy a new pair.",positive
The plugs feel like safety plugs and remove almost as much noise.When  I put these on I was able to reduce my volume level in half!I am now able to listen to my mp3 player while mowing the lawn.But the feel took a while to get used to.  Soft and spongy in my ear didn't feel right at first.Great value for the price.,positive
I've been using these buds for around a year now and have really enjoyed them.  They greatly reduce ambient noise and decrease conversational noise immensely.  I especially recommend these buds to those travelling in carpools or public transportation!,positive
They do a nice job of isolating...they block out tons of noise. They can be a tad noisy when you chew...,positive
"Works fine as a basic set of earphones. However, the one-size-fits-all foam earplug doesn't quite fit right and pops out quite easily. Instead, move on and look for a set with rubber ""caps"" that they often ship with 2-3 different sizes - these fit better, stay put without fatiguing the ear.",negative
"I found these to be a waste of money and time. They didn't stay in my ears, I have very small ears, no matter how I tried I could not get them to fit properly, even the smallest cushion caused discomfort. The only thing they have going for them is that they are cute.",negative
I had a older version of this headphone that had the angle plug on it.And they lasted for 3 years. These new ones have a straight plug and lasted only 2 weeks before i had to replace them. If they go back to the angle plug i will buy these again. If you look at the photo you see the angle plug they changed it to a straight plug.,negative
"No matter what sale or deal there is or how cheap it is, do not buy these earphones.I've purchased $8 headphones that were 1000 times better.I would not want these for free. Sound quality is crap.They're comfortable but that really doesn't matter if the sound is horrible.",negative
"Excellent price for a non audiophile. For me, sound is great and isolation is too. Nice snug fit. They tend to wiggle a but lose when I run so I use a headband to help hold them in. This works because they are so small and the headband doesn't make it feel like a vise.",positive
"These headphones work well and if used properly by gently rolling the foam then immediately inserting into ear, these will stay put and act similar to an ear plug allowing you to hear your music at a low volume level since they block outside noise.",positive
They are very comfortable and fit nicely and securely in the ear canal. This fit is better than silicon earbuds. The sound quality I'd much better than any earbud in this price range.,positive
"The only fault I could find with these is that the cord is too short.  Other than that, they're great.",positive
"Just Super Sound coming form this small device. I use it when I travel on the airplane and discovered I don't need the bulky expensive noise canceling headphones. With the ear plugs nicely placed, all you hear is great sound, and its easy to carry around. Definitely recommend it.",positive
"Good deal for the $.  The foam earplugs fit much nicer, especially if you have big old ear holes, like I do.This is my 3rd pair and I've liked all of them",positive
"You will read reviews of this product talking about how quickly the foam plugs bounce back, and that you can't get them in your ears fast enough...Koss obviously made great improvements to the foam. THE FOAM IS NOW SLOW RECOVERY, meaning you can get it into your ear. This alleviates the only real downside to the product.",positive
"I've owned Sennheiser, Sony and other headphones, and these are by far the best of the lot. I've used my pair for five months, and they have held up well to the rigors of daily use. Factor in the price, and you can't go wrong.",positive
"These are OK earbuds as far as sound quality but not better than ones that came with my Zen-M. They are more durable than orgionals and stay in the ear better but they seem to take more volume to hear well and I find the sound quality on the Koss ""Spark Plugs"" much better.",neutral
"The original foam cusion is not very comfortable. There is an excellent article on[...] which describe a simple mod to make it an excellent sound isolating in-ear monitor. Based on your listening preference, you may decrease the bass or mid level damping. The mod will make it a poor man's Shure.",positive
The horrible ear buds that came with my pricey MP3 player not only gave me an earache but were a pain in the neck to keep in place.  I could wear these little Koss plugs all day long and never know they're there.  And sound quality is perfect.,positive
"These work for some people's ears and not for others. One reviewer claimed that I must be either retarded or deformed since they don't work for me. That reviewer is best described by words not allowed in this venue.I'm going to replace the useless foam, others have suggested:for hunters: Silencio Super Sound Baffler earplugsfrom a pharmacy: Flents &quot;Quiet Please&quot;I believe you have to create the center hole in these products to retrofit them to the Koss' &quot;stem&quot;.- Jeff",negative
"Good sound isolation, too much bass for realistic sound, might be ok if you only listen to disco...very uncomfortable after about 30 minutes.",negative
"this product is a great value. when coupled with the (2 Pair, Trilevel - Earphones Plus brand replacement ear cushions made to fit Klipsch, Shure, Etymotic and other models requiring a 2mm attachment diameter. Clear, Large) it makes these ear buds on par with higher cost phones.",positive
"Don't expect these to last for more than 3-5 months before one of the sides stop working.  Used them for ~1 hr a day 5 days a week for exercising, and they broke after 3 months.  Very poorly made, and $9 for a warranty replacement.",negative
"I find these ear buds to be very comfortable, decent at sealing out surrounding noise and have decent sound.  One downside is that because the sound comes through a plastic straw-like tube, if you're opening your mouth (i.e. eating, yawning) the tube will pinch and the sound will become muffled, but this is only temporary.",positive
I have bought these before and had the left ear plug go out after 5 months. Koss has a lifetime replacement guarantee so i returned them and after 7 months with my new ones the same thing happened. For the price its not bad but be warned you get what you pay for.,negative
"Now these are not balanced to start with, more boost in the muddy area (200hz-300hz). But with a little cut in this area they are sooooo good. They rival even my Sony MDR-7509HDs when this cut is applied. I also have an communications headset from Koss, SB-49 for $50, which I've used for gaming AND mixing audio. Koss just makes great sounding gear, but pay for the high end stuff to get out-of-the-box balanced.",positive
Great sound while they worked.  One earpiece just quit working all of a sudden.,negative
these are some of the worse headphones i have tested the sound is horrible and tiny using an ipod touch no bass what so ever. i guess i have not learnt my lesson sony seems to  have the best sounding headsets for this price range.,negative
"These are great ear buds. If you squish the foam down and quickly put them in your ears, they expand and fit to your ears. Helps to block outside noises, and makes them comfortable. They feel secure and don't fall out if I'm moving around. Great for people who like to walk around with an ipod. Great bass, which is really important to me.",positive
"I wrote a long review about all the benefits of these eaplugs, but then I figured - I'm the jillionth person to review these.  I'm not sure I can add anything, so I'll make this quick:Cool earphones. Work great, cost nothing, totally camouflaged.Not sure?  Buy both kinds.Thank You",positive
"Two of my kids have a problem with keeping ear buds in their ears, always being too big for them. They love KOSS 'THE PLUG' IN-EAR HEADPHONES because you can manipulate them into your ear cannel, fitting snug. The only drawback is your earwax tends to cling to them, so they will need to be cleaned.",positive
Good base and good sound. I buy one and usually send them back to Koss for $9 (lifetime warranty) when they crap out.  I'm a heavy user and use these virtually every day anywhere from 1.5- 7 hours/day.,positive
I always get sore ears from the standard earbuds that iPods provide. I've got smaller-than-normal ears and the buds are really painful after a while. These Koss headphones are like little sponges that you squeeze when putting in. Then they expand to fit the exact size of your ear. Fantastic. They also have great sound. Definitely worth ordering.,positive
"These have very good bass, although they don't sound as good as my Sennheiser CX300. The price is cheap so I mainly use it when I'm on the streets so, if someone steals it I wouldn't get very angry.",positive
"I have tried many brands but the koss have been my favorite for years, yes they die but I use them during workouts, runs, etc. I would say I go through about 3/year and think they are well worth it. I also have the gold kdx models (two), sent them for repairs and the customer service was nice...thanks",positive
"Didn't see that they were any better than other buds I have. Again, OK for the money. yo yo yo",neutral
"""The Plug"" offers VERY poor balance across the sound spectrum, they are very bass heavy/boomy, resulting in a very muddy sound. Unless you listen to your music with the bass turned ALL the way up, I suggest looking elsewhere.  Also, the acoustic tube is far too rigid and can scratch/gouge your ear canal.  Overall, a poor choice.",negative
As a long time Philips HE592 user I was looking for something better or at least as good.  In a head-to-head comparision the results are clear.  The Koss require more power on the signal to create the sound (1.5-2x more).  The bass is jittery and the overall sound quality poor.  There is not nearly as much bass as the HE592.  Compared to the HE592 it sounds like you are listening to the playback through a metal can.,negative
These are actually a replacement.  My first set lasted for a few year and needed another.  Best earbuds for the money hands down!,positive
"I needed some earphones that would be more comfortable and louder than the cheap earbuds I had.  I'm very happy with these on both accounts, and as a bonus they are much cheaper than a lot of the other options.",positive
These did not sound well at all and fit was even worse.  Ears got tired after just a few minutes during one song!,negative
"Cannot accurately assess audio quality since the provided ear plugs did not fit properly, making it impossible to create adequate sound isolation.",neutral
"After all the grand reviews, I had really high hopes and expectations for these.  Unfortunately, they have all the depth of a 1970 transistor radio. I may have received the lemon pair but who wants to buy them again hoping for a better sounding ear bud?  Don't waste your time is my advice.  Find a genuinely well made ear bud.",negative
"I think these work great.  fit well, sound is just fine, and for the price, I've not found anything remotely in the same league.  I can only assume the part about tasting good, as I have not eaten them myself, but my cat has devoured several sets, so my presumption is, in a pinch, wouldn't make a half-bad snack.",positive
"For me, these feel better and achieve a better seal than the norm.  A good seal is essential for achieving strong bass.  They are rated a little more efficient (the dB rating) than many of the others, and this was noticeable.",positive
I bought these for my husband since he has sensitive ears.  He loves them!,positive
These earplugs fit well and sounded pretty good. Bass response wasn't that great but what do you want for the price?,positive
"LOUD AS HELL! And sound proof to the world. You wont hear much past whats pumping through your headphones. Bass is nice and deep. Sharp sound. Not for anyone that doesn't like things in their ears. Best part, if you are a deaf fella like myself, you can pop the foam off of these and the tubes are the perfect fit for your old hearing aid in ear molds. Can get that perfect fit.",positive
I bought this for me. But my kids love them so much I have to buy a send set. They are that good.,positive
"these babies sound pretty sweet for $12! Don't waste your dough. Get these, and turn DOWN the bass on your iPod (set EQ to electronica), they'll sound frickin sweet!",positive
There are more expensive ear plugs but these work very well. I use them when I jog and while on the motorcycle.,positive
"I now own three pair of these,  They are a bargain, as I have dozens of earbuds (mostly in ear) and their efficiency and sealability give a full rich sound.  The only pair I ever &#34;broke&#34;  was a pair that I sent through the wash TWICE!  You will spend at least 2-3 times their price to beat them.  One audiofile stated that he felt another set was much better (at $299.00)  Again, best value given their  price and performance.",positive
"For a younger person with perfect hearing these might have less fidelity than others.  However, these are extremely comfortable.  The isolation from the outside noise is better than most other ear bud style phones.  And, they don't have the fall out problems associated with typical ear buds.  Koss, ""Sparkplug"" earphones are also worth consideration.  The Sparkplug model earphones sound about the same, but have a little higher profile out of ones ear.",positive
"I love these headphones and have been using them for years.  My kids (8 and 10) discovered them and now won't use any others.  They are very comfortable and block out outside sounds when you are using them.  Only downside is that they aren't very durable, but Koss give a lifetime warranty on them and you just have to pay for shipping to get them replaced.",positive
"The sound of it is ok but, the fit is terrible after a while of use they starting to hurt and itching inside the canal ear.",negative
"Just bought these - they isolate sound, have very good high-end, are comfortable and stay in my ear (most ear buds fall out). I also bought a pair of the Coby CVE92 ear buds because I thought they'd fit as well. Sure enough they do, but they sound terrible in comparison. In addition, these have a lifetime ""no questions asked"" warranty - that's gold, my friend.",positive
For the price you pay these are pretty good headphones.  Fit better than most in your ears and last FOREVER.  Not the best you will find but for listening to books or music on walks or traveling they work perfect.,positive
"I ordered these because my very favorite earbuds broke and needed a cheap pair untill they are fixed. You get what you pay for. Not comfortable and they have a feedback.  Airbuds makes a pair called,&#34;the most comfortable earbuds&#34;,  well, they are and have fantastic sound!",negative
"I like how the foam plugs conform to your ear, but if you want them in tight - like for running - and you don't get them wedged in just right, the foam will squeeze shut and block the sound.",positive
"Try to get the metallic silver and purple in color koss plug earbuds as the sound is phenomenal for the price. I had a fairly expensive pair of sony earbuds that were around $40.00 and one channel crapped out after about 6 months. hard to believe, but the koss plug earbuds sound way better then the more costly sony. go figure.For the price and the sound, these earbuds can't be beat. good going Koss.",positive
"Better than I could have hoped. They are comfortable, sound great and are an incredible deal from one of the best names in sound. Makes my iPod Touch the music machine I always wanted.",positive
I like:- Quality sound.I do not like:- Easily drop of my ears- I have to squeeze hard to fix the ear and it bothers.,neutral
"these headphones to me are my favorite, after you get used to squeezing them and setting them up correctly in your ear. they reduce outside noise and sound great with bass. plus when you workout or mow the lawn you dont have to turn up your music as loud with other headphones, this is very nice with big yards and helps keep your hearing from getting damaged.",positive
"I like these, they sound good, are priced reasonable, block out all other sound. My only complaint is that I cant find the soft replacement ear buds. I have purchased ones that are said to be replacements but they seem harder & are not as easy to roll. Think I will need to buy a new pair in order to get the soft ones.",positive
The ear buds make nice ear plugs.  I wear them at work to block out noise. Sound quality is good but not the best.  They came with 3 different sized buds.  I think they are a good value for the price.,positive
Just as expected,positive
Made from cheap materials but an okay product,neutral
So far so good!  Perfect volume control!  I highly recommend it!,positive
Works great for metal detectors that don't have volume control,positive
"I was looking to control the volume out of my Samsung UN40EH6030, which has a fixed volume output out of the 3.5mm jack. I wanted to used headphones when watching BluRays or playing 360, so I got one of these instead of an expensive amplifier. Works beautifully; no noise and the volume is sufficient. Excellent product for this type of use.",positive
"The product works as advertised, and is very simple to use. I am using it to control the volume on an external speaker connected to a Spirit Box for use in investigations for my paranormal research group.",positive
Doesn't have much range. This definitely decreased the volume in my headphones. It works as a volume control but it shouldn't decrease the volume to do so.,negative
"And when you need a volume control (down only) in a 3.5mm format, this one works fine.  It is not an amp, just a volume control.",positive
It worked fine for a few months but now the sound coming out is really fuzzy in other words it's ready for the garbage... hold on... ok it is now in the garbage can. Btw I never moved this around at all.Good thing I waited to review this.,negative
"Works as advertised, well worth money spent Koss makes great products for the home or car, so if you want or need a volume control then this one is for you!",positive
"The volume controller is reasonably well designed; no crackling drop out of volume, or other distortion during use.  It's ergonomics allow it to feel good in either hand.  The connecting cord is to short and the quality of the wire feels cheap.  This product was a recent purchase, so I can not comment on longevity.",positive
the koss vc 20 volume control works well. however it is cheaply made & if you start to leave the room without removing your headphones you might find yourself needing a new volume control. spend a little more & get one that is not so flimsy. again to it`s credit the device what it was designed for.,neutral
"I bought this in order to inexpensively kill the AGC of my video capture card. When the volume was lowered closer to where it was barely audible, there was lots of crackling and distortion. Upon examining its audio waveform at the lower settings, the negative phase of both channels was becoming increasingly truncated/clipped. Depending on what it's connected to, it's good for slightly controlling the volume; however, look into using an amp, instead, for maximum volume control.",neutral
I bought this so that I could easily control the volume on my iPod Touch during bike rides and it does the job perfectly.,positive
I connected the speakers in my hot tub to my computer so I needed a volume control at the hot tub - works perfectly!,positive
Works great and I'm glad I got this with the purchase of my new Audio-Technica ATH ANC7 headphones.,positive
"Construction isn't that heavy duty, but if you want to reduce the output of electronic, stereo devices to match the input of what you're connecting it to - it works.  Price was right and is convenient for my purposes.  I recommend it - all things considered.",positive
"These work fine but have a short working lifespan. I have owned two VC20's and both stopped working in stereo, then altogether. They were used only for listening in bed so they were not abused. I liked the volume control but would like to see them better made, even at a higher price.",neutral
"This is my second one, I could never get my first one from my wife so I needed to buy one for myself,  It works well and is relatively inexpensive.It is a great buy for the money and I have had several other Koss products before and alway been very satisfied with them",positive
"I would have liked to see a larger dial that offers more levels, but if you need a simple volume control than this is the one.",positive
This is a perfect companion piece for my f11 line-out dock and bluetooth transmitter/receiver for my ipod.  Allows me to control the volume at the mobile end of the set-up.  clip on back allows me to keep it handy.My only complaint is the small size of the volume control wheel.  It could stand to be larger and have some sort of tactile method of adjusting the volume before pressing play.,positive
"I have one of these between my CarPC and AMP input.  The soundcard was putting out to much power, turning the volume up to 10 out of 100 on the PC would almost blow the speakers.  This thing was the quick and easy fix to give a little more breathing room to the PC volume.  I haven't noticed any sound quality loss though I dont have the nicest of speakers to notice fine detail.",positive
"I typically have my ipod in a leather case, tucked in my pocket, and I don't want to have to dig it out when I want to adjust the volume.  This device is a practical & inexpensive solution to that function.",positive
"I have the controller on the outside of my motorcycle helmet. It's hooked up it a Pyle headphone amp and XPro speakers. Absolutely no issues with this controller. It would even work great if I was an idiot and was doing 100+ on my bike, but I would never do that. ;)",positive
"Performs as advertised. Some people have noted a drop in audio quality, but to a person with average ears such as mine, your audio should sound almost exactly the same. The price is definitely fair.The one problem I've encountered so far is that the volume dial is recessed from the side, so I have to use my fingernail to turn it. But it's only a minor annoyance since the product works.",positive
"Purchased to be used to adjust the volume of my Pro 4AAT phones while snoozing at night, the tiny volume control, no balance, and flimsy construction make these useless for me.At $10, not worth the hassle of returning.Koss should not put their name on such a piece of junk. Next time, I'll pay more and buy something better.",negative
It was bought in case I had issues hearing from a pair of earbuds that I bought and it works great.,positive
"I use headphones at night to watch TV and this helps because I can clip it to my PJ's & adjust the sound level, on our 'ME' TV channel the commercials are at a higher sound level then the show even though there is now a federal law against this practice .... The wheel that makes the adjustment is VERY touchy, takes some practice to get used to it, so it lost a star because of that ...",positive
"If you have a device that allows for headphones, but doesn't have a volume adjustment, this is for you.I've been using this to ""tone down"" the audio that is sent from my Xbox 360's audio dongle. The volume control has lasted well since the purchase, with no visible signs of wear, in spite of being used while traveling. Also, the sound quality is pretty good, with no detectable leakage.I would greatly recommend this.",positive
"This works well but maybe I am short; well no maybe, but the wires for this are so long it detracts a little from the enjoyment end up bundling them together.  Main thing is they work well.",neutral
"Good quality, no impact on audio quality.The wheel is small and recessed.  Maybe it was designed like this to prevent inadvertent movement if the device is in a pocket, etc.  But it kinda defeats the purpose of having an inline control if you're gonna stick it in your pocket.  Anyway, the a larger wheel or more open access would be an improvement.",positive
I bought this to be able to control audio volume.  Similar devices of other brands/no brands purchased in the past all just disintegrated; Koss is built much better and so far so good.  No complaints.,positive
Simple in-line volume control. Works as its supposed too which is all we can ask. No issues with it at this time.,positive
This allows me to control the volume on my head phone instead of have to use the mouse on the laptop.I like it alot. Is also used when hooked up to the headphones for the tv or the mp3 player. Very convenient.Recommend. works great.,positive
use headphones with the speaker output on my tv. There is no volume control on that output. added this inline before my headphones. Works perfect.,positive
"If you have a television that does not give you variable output to headphones, this is what you need. It words simply said, better then I thought!",positive
Digital portable radios drive me crazy with the huge change in volume that comes with one unit of volume increase/decrease.  I use this to adjust radio volume through headphones in a more useful way.  All is well.,positive
"I often buy headphones with built-in volume control.  But the brand and style I really like is no longer available.  I discovered this in-line volume control, realized it would work with any standard headphones using a 1/8 inch plug and I couldn't be happier.  If I need extra cord length for my phones, this gives it.  And I will always prefer a hardware volume control to a software one.  It's just so much quicker and easier to deal with.",positive
"I bought this and used it for a few weeks before it just died. No reason, no drops or bumps. It just quit working. I requested a replacement, because I really liked it while it worked. The returns process was quite easy and I didn't have to pay to ship it back. Overall, still a positive experience.",positive
"Bought this because my earphones had no in-line volume. It does what is says it will. My one complaint was that is can only decrease the volume, not increase it.",positive
"I use it with Zoom H1 portable recorder, I had a serious issue with Zoom that its intake level is VERY HOT!. So whne you get a line out from a mixer, you have no way to control the input gain! This is perfect for that. also it is Very clean sound !",positive
"Definitely worth getting. Comes in handy when you can't control the volume what you're listening to, as you would expect.",positive
Works great.  Can't say much else about this product other than write filler words so I can hit the submit button (got it).,positive
"for my use it's perfect. I just have my speaker set to the max volume (because its broken) and i control my volume with this, i love it although that shipping thing threw me off. $13 ... -.- would have liked to know from the start thank you very much.",positive
"this item is an inexpensive handy item to adjust the volume on your IPod, etc without using the control of the IPod.However, this is not an amplifier, but a vclume control only",neutral
When I plugged in my stereo headphones I got nothing.  I found I had to pull the plug out about half way and jiggle it around to make any contact.  Then I got mono sound.  Think someone installed the wrong jack during manufacture.  Got a different brand elsewhere that works fine.,negative
"Wonderful, very useful! My old portable radio and hardly responds to the volume control and I have returned to this attachment to use with headphones and volume control again.",positive
"This product does what it is supposed to do.  I've occasionally noticed that the connection isn't perfect, but mine's been banged around a lot and dragged on the floor of my study.  I've always been able to get rid of any connection problems by just ensuring that the my phones are plugged in tight. This product comes in handy.",positive
I used this to control the volume of a 2.1 speaker system.  however it does not control it properly.  The sound gets switched between speakers sometimes.. other times it just does not reduce the volume.  Havent tried it with a headphone though.,negative
"As the night wore on the FM became static ridden.  I followed earlier reviews, popped the cover (3 screws) and counter-rotated the VR2 about 1/4th turn.  The signal improved dynamically and the static was gone!",positive
Feels pretty darn cheap and the cable is frighteningly thin but I have had this thing for years and have not been particularly nice to it and it still works.,neutral
"It's a good unit and does what it's supposed to do, but the sound passing through loses some quality. Seems slightly distorted or missing some of the sound ranges.",positive
"The Koss VC20 volume control works very well. At very low volume ((I would say less than 5% of max.) it gives sound only in the left canal, but that's really not a problem. I didn't notice any sound distortion otherwise.It has a small metal clip which can be &#34;removed&#34; (i.e. torn off) for the users who might find it problematic.",positive
Just exactly what I was looking for. Satellite box audio output was un-adjustable and very loud. This fixed the problem.,positive
"Does exactly what it should. I use it with a Blue Tooth receiver to work as wireless headphones with a set of ear buds. No noise on changing volume levels, long lasting (wear at night, so subject to toss and turn). The variable resistor must be of some quality in that it hasn't started making noise yet. (most cheap volume controls (potentiometers), start making noise after a short while).",positive
"It worked quite nicely for a few months, but then the sound started cutting out.Will buy again, as it is the only product I've found to add in-line volume control to headphones for any device, not just iPhones (which I don't have or like) Also, $10 2-3 times a year is definitely worth the convenience in my mind",neutral
"This is something you probably won't fully appreciate until you've had one for a while and then lose it. You may not need a headphone extension cord with an inline volume control. But once you get used to having one, you'll find the convenience and functionality are habit forming. The one I lost was in daily use for 3 or 4 years and continued to work well.",positive
This handy audio extension really helps while watching videos on the Kindle Fire. Offers an external volume control.Highly recommend this Koss unit to anyone who has noticed the modest volume output for the Kindle Fire. This is smaller than my earbuds when both are wrapped up.,positive
"Does a good job at attenuating the sound out of my phone.  My Android has a bug where the media volume resets to max anytime a notification sounds.  This lets me set the media to max and then turn it down to comfortable.  I have very good earphones, and haven't noticed any sound issues.  The cord is flimsy feeling and quite long, so I've just kept it tied in a bundle.  We'll have to see about its longevity.",positive
I listen to my TV once in a while using my bose QC15 headphones.  The problem with that set up is that volume cannot be adjusted and plays at full blast.  The Koss VC20 volume control module mitigated that issue.  Works as described.,positive
"The connection between the headphones and the volume control doesn't seem to be too great. While adjusting the volume using the Koss Volume Control, one or both ear buds will stop working until I hit a &#34;sweet spot&#34; on the volume dial.",neutral
Feels and looks cheap.  It seems to work ok but sometimes you want a product for more than just functionality.  Its a little embarrassing using this ugly thing when I really like the look and feel of my headphones.,negative
"This is a surprisingly useful gadget, as it serves as an extension cord and volume control. The extension cord aspect adds about 3 feet to your headphone, which gives me a lot more room to move when I am listening to music on my computer. The volume control is handy when using a portable player because you can change the volume without jostling the player.",positive
I use a radio to put me to sleep at night. I plug a pillow speaker into my radio or smartphone to listen to talk radio.It is a lot easier to control the volume with this that waking up my smart phone and using the volume control on it.,positive
"My wife watches a lot more TV, often using headphones so that I can avoid the incessant prattle of TV. This allows her to control her earphones that are powered by the TV audio output.  (The audio output is always on, but doesn't have a volume control.)",positive
"Economical way to make any headphones volume controllable. Works great and delivery was swift. Although it is compact, it seems sturdy enough to last for years.",positive
"If you have audio equipment that doesn't have a volume control...for some odd reason, then this does the trick to fix that problem.",positive
"If you want a buffer between you and the audio source, get this product. Well made and it will save your hearing.",positive
"The Koss VC20 volume controller really does what it's suppose to. Not really much else to say about it, honestly.",positive
"This product gets three stars for being the exact product I needed.  I couldn't find any other offerings for a headphone extension with potentiometer volume controls.  It loses two stars for how it crackled and had a poor connection almost as soon as I got it in the mail, due to a low quality cable that easily breaks inside.",neutral
"product works ok, but the tiny wheel volume control is difficult to turn, I have to use my finger nail to really turn it. Other than that I am happy with it.  Not really a professional volume controller, but it does the job, what do you want for such a cheap price ?",neutral
The sound is perfectly fine.  I couldn't tell any difference in quality when I had it connected directly or through this volume adjuster.  The cord eventually wore out after a lot of abuse.  I wish it was stronger.,positive
"great item.  used for night time sleeping. operation by roller dial, easy and efficient item will buy a second for spare",positive
This product performs as advertised. I use it to connect a Bose Quiet Comfort headset to my computer for gaming and such to not annoy others nearby. Makes it much easier to control the volume with a physical wheel then through windows. Not much else to say about it.,positive
It didn't take much use before the volume control stopped responding and the cord began shorting out the audio playback.,negative
"I was hoping to get more volume from my tablet with an auxillary conrol, but that was not the case.  But, still a good product for extending the length of your speakers.",positive
I got this because when we are recording music I dont like it loud in my eadphones and some time Freddy P wants it super loud in his ear.  This way we can both have it as loud or as low as we want.  Great deal.,positive
I am using this volume control to operate the volume from a  satellite radio to one of the popular mini- mini speakers being sold which do not have volume controls.  Works just fine.,positive
"So I loved the one I purchased for home so much that I purchased another for my headphones at work :) Simple, does what it says and a nice cheap price!",positive
"A good little tool to have around the house, especially when gaming. I can plug this into the computer then my headphones into it, then adjust the volume from there without having to alt-tab to change the volume.",positive
I use it at work where I use in-ear earphones and this is very handy to lower the volume quickly when someone is talking to me. Very useful.,positive
Not sturdy but has lasted a year so far without problems. Even the cheapie in-line volume control has not created any noise problems. The price is right and this extension can be used with any headset. I think Koss will replace the cord free if it goes bad.,positive
"The cable feels cheap and it is a thinner cable, but so far I've had no issues. The volume control is good, there is no hiss or distortion when adjusting volume. I'm rather picky with audio and I haven't had any issues, there is no interference or sound distortion that I can tell. I highly recommend it.",positive
I have a sole elliptical that has built in speakers and an input for 3.5mm stereo plug.  It does not however have a built in audio control.  Running straight from my Roku player to the elliptical was too loud and from the tv too low.  This works perfectly connecting my Roku player to the elliptical now that I can control the volume.,positive
"The volume control dial is way too small and Ina depressed area making it hard to use.  Also, it seemed to have trouble controlling the volume as 2/3rds of the dial did nothing and all the volume control was in the last 1/3rd.",negative
"It is cheap!... I know :)It's ok, works as expected... just don't think it's going to last long, 'cause seems like cheap, light plastic-constructed.",neutral
"Koss VC20 Volume Control unit. Does exactly what it says it does, exactly as it expected. No more, no less.",positive
Made listening on the head phones much more comfortable and convenient.It is a good addition to the purchase of head phones,positive
I have owned two of these.  I love the product till it stops working which it will.  Mine lasted longer than the 90 day warranty but both died within a year.  The wires start cutting out without any noticeable exterior damage.,neutral
"This item works very well and gives provides convenient volume control for headphones, portable speakers, IPODs, etc.  Easy to use, I highly recommend them.",positive
"Did most of what I wanted... gave me easy to access volume control while I was snowboarding. On the other hand, as soon as I took a tumble the tiny fragile little metal clip bent way out of shape. A good thick one wouldn't have done that. I'm knocking off a star for that, since this isn't completely ideal for someone using this for a sports purpose. Aside from that, it does work pretty well.",positive
I use this to ad a volume control to my headphones for my computer. It works. What more can I say.,positive
"I have a number of headphones that for some reason have no inline volume control.  Of course, I can always dig my IPod out of my pocket or backpack, but it's not always easy, like this device, which clips to pocket of belt.Now I move this minimally priced add-on from headset to headset and wear the pair most comfortable for the situation.",positive
"This is a handy and inexpensive little device.  A convenient way to ""tweak"" your volume level.  Works fine. No complaints.  Like all headphone cables it doesn't like to be rolled over by chair rollers, stomped on or yanked out of the socket.  If you treat it with moderate care, it ought to last for years.",positive
"Volume control dial is a little small.  Probably makes so it doesn't adjust in you pocket, however if you have large hands this may be difficult to adjust.  Worked as expected, at $8, I thought it was a little overpriced.  However now I am able to control my audio volume from TV to my Headset,",positive
This Koss is very good one for volume control. There is no noise sound when I adjust volume. I can't distinguish whether I plug my headphone with this Koss because it has no effect to my head phone at all. I use HD555 which has 50 ohms impedance so I think this Koss may reduce some power of my headphone. But not at all. My HD555 still provides great sound. I love it.,positive
"Nice product.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Quality is great, but it does not have any type of pause button on it.  It is strictly a volume control only.",positive
"Not much to write, this is a great addition for those headphones which don't have their own volume control and you don't want to mess with the Windows volume or your music player volume.I just put them on high and control the volume through this instead.Recommended.",positive
"This does the task it is supposed to do. It provides an inline volume control for headsets that do not have one. I realize that many headsets are available that have this built in. However, we have several nice pair of headsets without this feature. Rather than replacing expensive headsets, I bought this to make it easier for me to change the volume without fiddling with controls on the computer or ipod.",positive
"I bought this volume control for sports activities. Big mistake, it lasted for less than three months, the cable connection to the volume control is broken. The potentiometer that adjusts the volume is a piece of crap too. Don't buy this product for sports use.",negative
A gadget that is nice to have. Gives an extra length for extension. Some static noise when adjusting the volume.,neutral
"I have had them before. So I knew what I was getting. It is hard to find these at Walmart or even better, Radio Shack.",positive
"When you set the volume on your music player, it goes in steps and is hard to get the loudness you want. This helps fine tune your volume to the exact spot you want it! I really recommend this so you can get the volume you want.",positive
Worked just fine but someone stepped on it and it easily broke.  I may get another one though.  It is very inexpense.,neutral
"only worked for a short time about 2 1/2 mouths then one side or the other on the headphones kept going off I had to keep playing with it to get it to somewhat work ,  I got 3 of these and the same thing keeps happening.  it is very hard to find a good volume control.",negative
The volume control works as described and is well made.  The only complaint I have is with the long cord.  If you need to control the volume of your device at a distance this is the control you should buy.  Otherwise you will find yourself winding up the excess wire.,positive
"The view shows a 90 degree jack but the actual product is a normal straight on jack. The normal straight on jack will have stress on it. I bought this because my RCA HDTV has a headphone buzz, probably due to proximity to the the light source. If I had it to do over again I would get an LED HDTV back light. Much less chance of buzzing.",neutral
Nothing serious. The volume seems no different from when I control it via my phone. The only difference noted is the ability to leave my phone in my pocket. Not impressed at all.,neutral
i got it because of the l shaped plug in but when it got here it was just the old plain straight plug in,negative
"These external headphone or ear bud volume controls are dificult to find.  This one works very well. Wide range of volume control. Note that miniplug is straigt and not angled as shown in photo of product.  Actually I wanted the straight plug.  Only wish that the small pocket clip was removeable.  Minor detail, however.",positive
Bought this for my brother to use on his motorcycle speaker system and it works really good. For this price you can't go wrong with this.,positive
"Trivial setup, just put it between your headphones and whatever they were plugged into already. Works, although I agree with others who have mentioned that the thumbwheel is pretty small.",positive
"Very good volume controller and very useful, have it on my PC works with any head phones, does the job it was made for and works great.",positive
I got the Koss volume control mainly because I listen to books when I walk and the traffic often makes it difficult to hear.  Being able to just adjust the volume with the Koss volume control is much easier than pulling out my Ipod or MP3 player to do it.  It also conserves the battery by not having to adjust it on the player.  This works exactly like it is advertised.,positive
I purchased this volume control simply to give my headphones an extension cord.  Being able to adjust the volume is an added bonus.,positive
"After less than a month of being attached to my laptop, the volume control started introducing static, and suddenly it was as if the control was turned all the way down, no matter what I did with the volume wheel.",negative
"I think every pair of headphones should have built-in volume control, but a lot of them don't, so this bit of kit is needed.  They work just as expected with no degradation to the sound quality.",positive
This volume control is just what I needed to control the volume for headphones I own without a volumecontrol.  The control is simple and the volume changing is continuous and smooth.,positive
"I have bought two of these, one for myself and another for a gift.  I like having the thumb wheel volume control handy to raise and lower volume while watching movies on my pad.  It is a very solid product!",positive
"This product has been mediocre since the beginning.  When adjusting the volume control, the balance alternately shifts between favoring the right and left channels in an unpredictable manner.  After just a couple of months of use, there is a great deal of static and crackling when changing the volume.  Sometimes rapidly turning the dial from MIN to MAX several times alleviates the problem for a few hours.  This product is good if you're looking for an inexpensive, throw-away solution.",neutral
"Developed a short in the jack after 2 uses.  Sound was fine until then, now its a constant struggle to get the plug situated so that there is no static.",negative
"Im very happy with this extention. Not only does it giveme the extra length to use it for remote viewing thru my PC from bed, it is very convenient for volume I have complete Privacy and Control of my utube and Netflix viewing late at night, I wasnt sure but it turned out to be a Great Buy.",positive
"It works as advertised, it's nice and small and adds a little length to your existing headphone cord. Mine doesn't look exactly like the one pictured (it's more squared off than rounded) but no big deal, I'm still pleased with it and do recommend it.",positive
"This on-line volume control works good, no issues so far. I recommend it for anyone that owns headphones lacking volume control.",positive
"This product works fine, but when I tag it along with my JVC headphone, the combined wire length becomes unmanageable.",neutral
Does what it is supposed to do. Only criticism is the volume control knob is a little small.,positive
"I needed this to adjust the volume while snowboarding and wasn't able to remove my gloves while on the mountain to mess with the ipod, and this did the trick. Its also good as an cord extension. No reduction in sound quality and it definitely took in some snow, but still performs just fine.",positive
This works great. I have a MP3 player that I use when I am riding and it makes it easier to adjust the volume. Fast shipping.,positive
I have a Koss Headphone but leaning back in my chair was not quite long enough plus the volume control is very handy to make a quick volume control when needing to make quick volume controls as well as getting some more space.  The quality is very good with the headset and volume control.,positive
It's so convenient having a volume control for my earphones.  I use this when watching my TV since there is no volume control for the earphone connection.  I may order another one for use with my iPod so I won't have to dig it out of my purse to adjust the volume.,positive
"This is a great companion to my JVC noise cancelling headphones.  I don't really need the extra length while traveling, but at home the added range and direct volume control is a big plus.",positive
"I used this for my Father so he could control his pillow speaker control, which has no volume control. It's been working perfectly for about a year now.",positive
"The volume control degraded the sound quality significantly. If you use it with a cheap earphone, it may be OK for you, definitely not enevn with Koss PortaPro or KSC75.",negative
"I use this with my Bluetooth headphones the volume control is great which Is what looking for in this product, the extra cable length is a bonus.",positive
"If you're using this for headphones, it's probably fine. I was trying to use it as a replacement volume puck for amplified speakers, and the cable is so poorly insulated that all sorts of noise comes through. The volume control is nice and it is very small.",neutral
"The cable is thin, but appears to be a high quality. Connectors are well built.The volume control is easy to use, and will let you fine tune the volume to any lower volume.",positive
I love having a volume switch available no matter what headphones I use.  Also the cord is long enough to work as an extension. I've always enjoyed Koss products; the quality of sound from their headphones just sounds better to me than most-- especially for the price.,positive
Have used item very little but pleased with it. I would recommend to anyone with need of such a device.,positive
My portable XM radio was over driving the amp in my truck no matter how I adjusted it. Installed this product in line with the radio output and problem solved and for almost nothing.,positive
This year I bought a Dell Vostro laptop. It turns out that many/all have a problem with the audio in that there is a buzzing sound and noise  especially when using earbud headphones. Someone suggested using a volume control to increase the impedence. I didn't expect it to work but it does. The Koss VC20 reduced the problem to the point where it is barely perceptable. I am completely satisfied.,positive
Used for under the pillow stereo speaker. Also added a small headphone amplifier between this volume control and audio source. Would recommend.,positive
"PortaPro headphones did not dissapoint.  Sound was good, and a good alternative to in ear headphones.",positive
Well this product has absolutely exceeded my expectations in terms of the overall sound quality .. . And for the price that its offered. . .i can recommend any one to just buy it .. without thinking twice. ..Cons :  Not as comfortable as over the ear headphones. ..,positive
"I had a Koss CD player when I was little, and the bass was unmatched in a bookshelf system.  It made me the envy of my friends and translated into loyalty with KOSS headphones.  I can't say enough about these lightweight, gorgeous-sounding, funky headphones.  PortaPros have a lifetime warranty, look like something out of Tron, and spoil the listener with comfort and bass reproduction.  Buy 'em, and find something else to worry about, in life.  Highly recommended.",positive
"These headphones have been the companion to my laptop since the day I bought them. They are small, light, and deliver surprisingly good sound for the size.On the negative size, the foam ear pads can fall off very easily, and have a relatively short life. The sliders that adjusts the tension in the band move to max tension at the slightest touch.",positive
"I purchased these headphones looking for a set of sub-100 dollar on-ear phones.  Like many other reviews say, the sound quality is superb for the price range.  my only complaint is the comfort.  i don't wear them on a daily basis, and they are slightly difficult to get accustomed to.  other than that, this is a top notch product.",positive
"Good product for the cost. Good sound quality, folds easily and can be used a variety of settings. Nice price",positive
Many of my friends look at these headphones and wonder why I make such a big deal about them. They are not the most beautiful headphones to look at. But do they kick xxx when it comes to sound there are not another pair it this price range that even comes close .,positive
"I usually use ear buds, or speakers, but I thought I would try these. The bass and the sound response in general are quite good. They are seemingly flimsy, or should I say, light weight, but I have been pretty hard on them and they are still in one piece. I would recommend them over similarly priced ear buds, so long as the style appeals to you.",positive
"I've been using these headphones for over a year now and they're simply excellent.I know some have an issue with the style, but all I really care about is the sound quality.It's terrific.",positive
"Stop looking and just get these. They don't feel as comfortable as some other headphones, but they sound great!I love the retro look too.",positive
"I liked these headphones, pretty much what I paid for.  The metal band on the top grabs hair sometimes if you adjust it on your head... so just don't do that and you'll be good.Good sound, fairly comfortable.  Essentially just what I wanted.",positive
"They are collapsible, comfortable, they have great sound quality (good bass), and they come with a lifetime warranty. How can you not buy these?",positive
"I bought the Sennheiser PX200 and returned them since they hurt my head (7 3/4 hat size). These headphones sound better, (better range and low end), fit better, and cover more of my ears.  Solid value.",positive
"That's about it, really honest headphones, cheap and the sound is quite balanced. Headband pressure adjustable (firm / light). I find the firm a bit too tight but it's a good setting when being active. Totally recommend.",positive
"These are simply the best headphones that you can purchase for an under $100 price tag, and they are under 50$! Very full, clear, sound with an amazing amount of bass. The styling isn't the greatest in my opinion, but the amazing sound quality more than makes up for it.",positive
"Bought these for Christmas, they don't fit to head very well and tend to snap off if bumped.  These are very light weight.  They are still working though.",neutral
"Work well and easy to use.  The cord is to short, but the sound, build quality, and weight are are outstanding.  These headphones excel in these most important areas.  I will constantly pick them over a more expensive heavy set.",positive
"It works,.... the sound really come out from the phones. Just not as good sounds as I thought, or maybe I just played crappy music with lousy mp3 quality, downloaded from unreliable source. I confused.But the good thing is, I can bring it to airplane and don't have to use that even crappier headphones from airlines! yeay!It's not as pretty as it look from the picture though, I think that Beats by dr.Dre look more sturdier than this.",positive
i bought these because they looked kooky.  they sound good and they're foldable but they're not as comfy as i imagined.  they hurt after an hour or so.,positive
"I've had these for a while, haven't used them much and then have begun to do so with library books on CD. Okay to good sound, but the durability isn't great --- one of the ear pieces constantly comes off. It can be re-placed, but it's a nuisance.",positive
"Seriously, are these airplane headphones?  That's how poor I found the sound quality in these.  I was shocked after seeing all the great reviews for these and then after finally checking them out for myself, wow, what a let down.  They do look cool but even the $5 Skullcandy earbuds with poor sound quality sounds better than these.  I cannot believe this is Koss, I have owned numerous headphones by them but this is just sad.",negative
"The earphones are fine, but they create too much pressure physically on the skull (ears).  They don't just sit, they squeeze onto your ears.  Definitely a minus for me.  Maybe I'll get used to them, but so far I feel it was a bad call.",negative
"I bought these after Shure jacked up the price of their mini headphone from $30 to $90 (huh?).  Anyway, these sound just fine and are comfortable.My only complaint is how each side of the head band is connected together, that if I adjust it while on my head, my hair can get caught under the band.  Yoowwwzaaaa!  I don't have long hair, so I would imagine it would be even worse for those people.",positive
"I didn't care much for these the first time I heard them, tried them again and liked them very much, but later just seemed flat and not much life in there.  At first a wrote a positive review, but the more I listen the less I like",neutral
"Great sound, time proven stats and abilities. Check out reviews elsewhere, I did, these are the best quality for the price.",positive
"This morning they sold for $38.72 or something like that. Then they jumped the price to only a 10% discount. Now, it's a 15% discount.This is a bad business practice and Amazon is doing this more and more. It lessens the ability to purchase a product. I was ready to doit, but not when they suddenly jumped the price. I like the phones but not price jumps when I show interest in something.",positive
"These sound amazing, hands down the best under fifty you can buy. Not as stylish as some or even as durable but with a lifetime warrenty you can't go wrong. 4.5",positive
"Best sounding open ear headphones I've ever heard. I've used them almost every day for a long time. Bass is very powerful for something that doesn't enclose the ear. Sound is very clear and they can also handle a lot of power. As others have said, the headband can rip out a few hairs occasionally, but that is the only complaint I have.",positive
"These are great headphones for the money.  I wish the cord was a little longer as I use them at my desk.  The sound is far better than I've found with others in this price range, so it's a reasonable trade-off for me.  The lifetime guarantee doesn't hurt, either.",positive
There's not much I can add to what's already been said about the Koss PortaPro headphones. These have got to be one of the best values out there today. Sound is phenomenal. Comfort (for me) is very good. The only area for concern that I could see was the quality of the cable/jack. I added two layers of shrink tubing at this junction to relieve stress. I think that will be sufficient. Highly recommend this product.,positive
The 'gold' plug on these earphones is slightly smaller than regulation which causes the right earphone to cut out on some devices.  I bought TWO of these puppies and they are both defective.  The problem does not show up until they have been used for some hours (weeks).,negative
I use to own these same headphones back in the 80's and they are still dynamic!  I would recommend these headphones to anyone!,positive
"Do you wanna look like a jogger from 1982?  Do you want your music to sound fantastic at the same time?  These are your headphones.  Seriously, they sound excellent.",positive
They are a little overated do sound muddy depends on the track you listen to but highs never sound like they should.I wouldnt say there bassey but more of a swamped out muffled.You could do better if you look around but there not bad but if you own these they cant be you only pair,positive
"If you love the bass in the music, this is your headphones! This is a real killer with high expression of basses, high quality sound, good noise-blocking, comfy (but you probably will feel uncomfort in an hour, it causes sweating and heating in ears after some time), light-weighted and in contrast to style arguments of other reviews, pretty stylish with its blue color and metal connection.I strongly recommend the product. Especially given its price...",positive
Very deep bass for such little headphones needs a break in period top of head set can be a little uncomfortable in extended use other than that great value,positive
Ha widths years ago.Design looks a bit lighter than back then but has added fit switch (tight or loose) which is nice.As ever great sonice and the price I got it for ($25!!!) was a steal.Great choice for comfortable home use and moderately active outdoor performance!!!!!!!!,positive
"If comfort is your issue, these headphones do the job. I have very sensative ears. These heasdphones direct the pressure away from your ears and it is much more evenly distributed than any headphones I've tried (besides my super expensive noise cancelling headphones.",positive
Most cheap headphones claim they can reproduce bass down to 20 Hz but these are the only ones that even come close to matching that claim. The clarity and durability of these headphones is also amazing.,positive
I have owned a pair of Koss Porta-Pros back when they first came out and could not believe the sound from these headphones. I have tried other brands but have never had as good of a frequency response that these headphones can produce. I will never buy any other pair of over the ear headphones as long as they keep these in production. They are that good.,positive
While you're shopping just remember this fact:KOSS PORTAPRO--ROCKIN OUT NONSTOP SINCE 1984 BECAUSE OF OVERWHELMING CUSTOMER DEMAND.There's one solid fact about the performance of portable headphones and that's it.  Go with the proof.,positive
"I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.",positive
They look old school but these things are awesome. I bought the replacement pads too but haven't had to use them yet. The sound quality is amazing and you don't lose anything like you sometimes do with noise canceling headphones.,positive
"I think these are great for the price, but they lack low end bass as they are compact, and the padding simply isn't there, to keep space to a minimum once again, but overall, I'm very much happy with them. Keep an eye out for a video review on the SonicOrbStudios YouTube channel for more :)",positive
"You notice more sounds with these headphones.  This is one example of traditional electronics that will never be beat, especially at this price.",positive
"Sure these headphones look a bit wierd. A matter of taste at best.However the sound is great! Whether the source is a smartphone, tablet or PC this is an excellent sounding headphone for the price.",positive
"For the price, there is simply no other set of headphones that will provide as warm and beautiful a soundspace. It's that simple.",positive
"I have been wanting a great set of headphones for years and finally took the time to research them and checked with C-net before I purchased anything. I am so glad that I got these, they are so very comfortable (even with brand new ear piercings) and sound incredible. I am also very happy to find out they have a lifetime warranty.",positive
My daughter didn't have a nice pair of headphones and we looked these up on Amazon and Cnet loved them so for Christmas I bought them for her. SHE LOVES THEM &#60;3,positive
"How often can you really ""feel"" the music? Well, now that is possible with the Porta pro from Koss. Just got mine and they are incredible. Amazing is too short to describe the experience. Highly recommended.",positive
"Fit only so-so, pressure adjustment flimsy. Sound quality very good but not outstanding; sound leaks very noticeable.",positive
I have Bose acoustic noise cancelling headphones which i paid $150 while this Koss Headphones I paid $25 ( black friday deal ). I can say I love this headphone way more than Bose. 100% recommended.,positive
"Suits my needs almost perfectly.  A great balance of quality construction, design, price and sound.  All that and a life time warranty from a company with a solid reputation.  I love these headphones.",positive
"I'm a live sound engineer. I have many pairs of headphones. I love these for personal listening with MP3 players, phones, portable digital audio devices. Great for travel. I've purchased several of these. They sound way better than you'd think.....",positive
"You really can't beat the sound of the headphones for the price. They fit really well, sound amazing, look sweet and rival higher end headphones. I am going to pick up a set for work and home. Even though they are portable, I still forget them. :)",positive
"I own several pairs of headphones and earbuds, ranging in price from $20 to over $500.  I've had a pair of these Koss PortaPro headphones for several months now, and used them on PCs for games and on an iPhone and an iPad for games, music and video.  These headhones have great sound with all the devices.  I like them so well that I just ordered 2 more pair.  It would be hard to beat them for the price.",positive
"I purchased these after reading many reviews and was not disappointed.  They do not have the best high range, but decent.  Great mid range and surprisingly good low end for the size and style.  They performed so well, that my 16 year old nephew ended up confiscating them as his.  When I called him out on the retro style, he shrugged and said &#34;have you heard these?&#34;  Enough said!",positive
"The sound of these cans is good but there are others that are its equal that have some better ergonomics.  The ergonomics are good once you get them on, but the headband and the ""Tension Adjustment"" for the earpads are fiddly.  I find that the Sennheiser PX-100 or the AKG K420 offer equal performance with better usability and similar comfort.",positive
"Comfortable, sturdy, & decent sound. I certainly would buy other Koss products & I rec'd this one for those of us who can't wear those uncomfortable ear buds.",positive
"Outstanding bass while keeping everything else clean, at an incredible low price; and confortable !",positive
"For the cash you can't get better. Plus: clear sound, low power consumption, comfy pads Minus: not really collapsible, hard to adjust firmness buttons, hair gets caught in band (and I have very short hair). Mated with Cowon's I7, you'd think a fortune was spent for the amazing sound. Not suggested for devices lacking a graphic equalizer-- top treble can get harsh without modification with higher volumes. Glad I purchased the oldie but goodie.",positive
"Yep. An old classic. No styling changes for 20-plus years. But they got it right the first time. Very lightweight and excellent sound. I use Grados for my serious listening, but these are just super for portable use. Probably why they call them 'PortaPro.' Only complaint, the top band is a little tweeky and thin. A wider band would render these bad boys perfect. Can't do better for the bucks though. Happy listening!!!!!",positive
"So I was in the market for a great pair of phones. Was looking at some grados, but they are pricey. So when I found these I was a bit surprised at the specs to cost ratio. Must say the look and feel great, and the sound quality is just fantastic. Would definitely recommend!",positive
"For the price it sells it's not worth it, even you can fold them, and they have a good bass sound.I decided to keep it, but would not reccommend it unless the price is $ 10.Purchased different Koss model, much happier now, keeping both pairs.",neutral
"These are comfortable and deliver great sound and the cost is reasonable.  I also own the Sennheiser PX100 which also sound great and are comfortable, but cost twice as much.  The Sennheisers fold down a bit smaller, but it's not a big difference.  The Koss Portapro is definitely a good quality product.  Good reviews from the audio experts, too.",positive
"Bought my set back in 2008, still working as I type this. The only thing to buy with it is Koss PORTABLE Replacement Cushions and 6ft&#34;Aurum Cables 3.5mm Male To 3.5mm Female Stereo Audio Extension Cable on Amazon also.",positive
Definitely one of the best sounding headphones under $50! Well worth the money. Just that it might pinch your hair.,positive
No longer use wired headphones as I have totally switched over to blue tooth headphones.  I couldn't deal with the messy wires. They worked well but they are in the pile of stuff for my local church to sell.,positive
"Pretty good sound, I like more bass and these are balanced.  Ipod touch powers them just fine.",positive
Everyone is surprised by the awesome sound when I have them listen to these. I use them regularly at the office as well as when I travel. They collapse well for travel.,positive
These are not what I expected based on the reviews I read & price paid.  They are on the flimsy side IMO & do not sound any better than most other cheaper & flimsy headphones I've tried.  If I had to do it over again & would have spent more & bought some Grados.,negative
"use it all the time on the subway.  it's been used for over 2 years.  just becareful of rolling up the cord.  after a while it could lose some of it's connectivity at the head socket if your'e too rough with it, but luckily it has a lifetime warranty.",positive
"I have had a pair of Koss PortaPro headphone since they came out about 20 years ago.  They are the best. I believe they were once top-rated by CU.  They have wonderfull bass, clear sound, are comforable to wear.  They are low priced.  They have a life-time warrenty for $6 S&H repair or replacement by Koss.  How may other headphones have this?  You will be very happy with the PortaPro.",positive
Simply the best inexpensive headphone on the market. Hard to believe they first appeared 20+ years ago and they still can't be beat.,positive
"The space between the speaker and the temple rest is too small and it hurts the ears.If you have big ears or a big noggin, don't get these.",negative
This is the second pair of Koss Porta Pros I have purchased (wire started shorting out after a few years of repeatedly dropping my ipod). Sound quality is great for the price.  They are comfortable to wear.  What more can you expect.,positive
"Better sound than I expected for the price I paid. They collapse easily, take up little space, and I don't have to shove them in my ears, which is nice.",positive
"Not a bad pair of headphones at all. Excellent sound quality all across the spectrum except it leaves something to be desired for on the low end of the frequency spectrum. Once you get below 60hz it really begins to taper off quickly the further down you go in freq. It's defintely high quality bass sound, not muddy, just soft. Extremely comfortable! I just expected these to have better bass response than they did.",neutral
"See title.  Both my wife and I love these, they fit nice, very nice price, look reasonably durable, and the sound range is everything I can hear.  What's not to like?",positive
"This is my favorite headset to use around the house. Pros: Light weight, collapsible, adjustable band, good sound, comfortable to wear. (i get tired of using my in-ear phones). It is not noise isolating but i like being able to hear my surroundings.",positive
Really nice pair of low cost ear phones that do a very decent job. If youu do'nt want to spend a lot of money you get your monies worth with this set.,positive
"My first PortaPros came with a Koss FM radio I bought in the mid-80s. They never wore out, outlasting the radio by more than a decade, and I eventually misplaced them.  I was thrilled to discover they're still available after all these years.  They're comfortable and durable, and they sound great.  Lifetime warranty, too. Very few products these days avoid obsolescence for a quarter century. The Koss PortaPros are tried and true, and still relevant. Imagine that.",positive
The build quality seems cheap and all but the sound quality is pretty good. The little pouch that came with it seems nice.,positive
"Decent, clean sound.  The offset design has advantages and disadvantages.  They fold up all right, but seem to spring back to a pre-set width so you can adjust and leave them in one position.  Not disappointed and the price is pretty good.",neutral
this is a decent headphone it works without issue and the wires seem to be thick enough not to bend and break leaving only 1 side working. however since i wear glasses they seem to be a little tight for extended use however if you can remove them for awhile every couple of hours then i would definetly recomend these especially at less than $50,positive
we have two pair for now over a year and they are well made and easy to store away in a purse-,positive
"This Koss Model received overall very good reviews.  I can understand why, they sound full, open  and music sounds great.  Also comfortable, although I have not worn them for an extended time.  I would recommend  if one uses them hooked up to a cell phone make sure the mike is relatively close to your mouth.  Others may have a difficult time hearing you.  Very please!",positive
I have this for 3 years now and I still use it for my everyday use. It is strong and sounds great better than a lot of my more expensive headphones. Too bad people care more about aesthetics then the actual quality if things anymore.,positive
"I bought them through a relative's recommendation. They sound great with classical and vocals, but the isolation is nonexistant so they are not the best options if you want to listen on a bus.",neutral
"The Koss PortaPro Headphones work for me as earbuds don't stay in place.  I use them while on the treadmill and they stay in place and provide good sound quality.  So far I haven't experienced any problems, I have had them over a month.",positive
"I purchased these headphones for a recent overseas trip.  I used these headphones on the flight to and back from Europe and they proved to be excellent for both music as well as movies.  If you can live with the design, these headphones are hard to beat for a reasonable price.",positive
"I was skeptical that these would provide such a good sound, but they really do sound as good or better than high end headphones.",positive
"Porta pros have been around for decades in various models and there's a reason they've been so successful. It's because they sound so good!  I've had several versions of these since the late 70s, and never been disappointed. Get some, you'll be glad you did.",positive
"I have owned these for two years now, and use them almost every day.  They are light, comfortable, and easy to carry in my bag.  I have recommended them to several family members who are also delighted with them.  The sound quality if very good for the price, and in fact, better than some that cost two or three times as much - as I have discovered to my regret!  I highly recommend these.",positive
"I just got these in the mail today. I wanted something cheap with decent quality. The sound quality from these headphones is amazing. I can't attest to the durability of them since I just got them, but wow, the sound is crystal clear with great highs and lows and no distortion. They are kind of dorky looking though.",positive
"It is absurd that these are so cheap. They sound basically as good as pro studio headphones. Totally effortless, full range of sound that is completely clear. And since they are open, you can still hear things around you, so you don't walk around with that sensory-deprived ""living in a cloud, disconnected from the world"" feeling.Also they're totally comfortable. Cannot go wrong with these.",positive
"very good headphones, especially for the cost. The sound is not really accurate, its more muddled in the mids and lows. But for some reason, this just makes them sound awesome, like some vintage amp playing an old school record. I definitely recommend these.",positive
"I find them comfortable enough. They are also small and light. They do sound fine to me, but I am not a great judge of that anymore. However, there is one annoying thing, the short cord. I am sure that's all in the eyes of the beholder, but that's how I feel.",positive
"I needed a set of headphones that was small enough to take with me wherever I go. These deliver surprisingly punchy trebels and mids. The bass could be stronger, but is not at all shabby for other headphones in this price range. Love the retro look. The foldability makes them ideal for my laptop bag and workout bag.",positive
These are great sounding headphones ! They are little hard sometimes to resize for your head but the sound is stellar for the price.,positive
"Everything the the other reviewers said seems to be true.  Much, much better sound and more comfortable than the &#34;standard ear-buds&#34;.  I flew 10 hours back to the US from Germany, after watching 4 movies, they are immensely comfortable.  They do catch your hair when removing or adjusting them.  Very nice sound for an under $30 set of headphones.  The lifetime warranty was the final clincher for me.",positive
"These headphones work great. I use them with my Ipod touch and my laptop. They are light, extremely comfortable and have excellant sound. Tough to beat for the cost, and the Koss warrenty is the best. Highly recommend.",positive
"These things have been around forever because they sound great. Sure, they look funny but if you're just chillin' at home, do it!",positive
"I am not an audiophile by any means, but the PortaPro headphones are exceptional.  The sound is, especially in lieu of the minimal cost of the unit, clear with a more than adequate amount of bass.  As a bonus, the comfort level when wearing these headphones is wonderful.  Bottom line...a funky looking set of headphones that deliver a powerful and enjoyable experience.  Try them...you'll like them!!",positive
"if you're considering buying this headphone, don't hesitate. it's worth your money. i use it for my ipod and my computer. i never thought headphone this price will sound this good. my only dislike is the looks.",positive
"I've had these for a few months now and I'm very satisfied. Great sound quality, very comfortable, and very durable compared to the plethora of plastic dominating the market. So 5 stars from me!",positive
"The portapro has very good sound and base,but the temple pads and metal hooks hurt my big ears,so I sent them back to amizon-Expo. The seenheiser px-100s also sound very good,but not quite as good as the portapros.I do like the px-100s because they are very comfortable.easy to use and are very well made and fold up better than the potapros,but Im still looking for a better headphone.",positive
"Best bucks I've ever spend on a portable headphone... Glad I didn't go with Bose AE2... this sounds just as good, just as comfortable, and 1/5th of the cost... Heck, best money I've ever spend on a headphone.Also love the open-ear design, I can finally hear people talking with me at work now :)",positive
Cnet had these as the be-all and end-all but I found them to be average on my beats audio type touchscreen computer.,positive
"I was on the verge of buying Bose headphones but the price bothered me. I read at least 50 reviews from different sources and decided to buy Koss plus my picky sister said they were good. I'm pleased, they sound great and the price is right.",positive
"Works Great if you're not planning on getting sweaty, Sounds fine for the money compared to the price of the XtremeMac  class of Ear/Headsets on the market.",positive
So it folds up.  That's nice.  It sounds pretty good.  That's also nice.  But it also feels pretty cheaply built and the connector is not at a right angle so I'm expecting that the wire will begin to break near there from all the bending.,neutral
"I own two pairs of these headphones and gave my son a 3rd pair for Christmas. Great sound, lightweight enough to go jogging with or wear around the house while doing chores. Unlike earbuds, they stay in place. They are not indestructible- if you accidentally step on them, you will break them. But they do hold up just fine with normal wear and tear.Highly recommended.",positive
"I've had a history with Koss, and they provide such amazing sound quality!Two tips:1. Take care of them or they will get destroyed.2. Try to keep them in your room (or they will get destroyed).",positive
"These Are Big on BASS...I actually put some Grado G cushions over the stock on here and that made them more balanced sounding. I haven't tried the Kramer mod (See HeadFi)  But could be the way to go.Overall I would easily recommend these. If you have a bright sounding source, or great for movies.....",positive
"It has an amazing bass and great sound quality, adding a great price you get an amazing product (the bad thing is that ii could be a little uncomfortable if you have a big head).",positive
"This are pretty okay in about every way.  I suppose you might be disappointed, after waiting 30 years to buy them, but tough luck, pal.",neutral
They sound every bit as good as my ear-surrounding headphones.  I find them much more comfortable than the now popular ear-buds.  I think they are stylish -- Geek style.,positive
"They are clear, crisp, and have just the right amount of bass.  You can't ask for any better sound from this style of headphone.  I have actually made a couple friends very angry when I told them to try my headphones, then ask what they cost, and then complain that they sound better than their $300 Sennheisers........",positive
"audio quality is great for the price bracket, but they feel flimsy. However, I haven't goofed up and done anything bad to them yet. I just wish that the build quality was a little better so I wouldn't be paranoid every time I used them.",neutral
"Great highs, mids and lows, for a $35.00 headphone you cannot go wrong... period. I have the Sennheiser px100 and may like these even more. More life and dynamics.",positive
The headphones work quite well.  They don't feel like great headphones but they have held up pretty well and produce good sound.  I use them on the treadmill as I don't like in ear headphones and they have held up well considering all of the sweat that has gone into them.,positive
This must be the 10th pair of headphones I've purchased in the last 5 years.  But I've finally found the one.  I read the other reviews and went with this one based on the quality of sound.  And it's great!  I am amazed at how much bass these things produce!  They also fold up well and clip together.  It should be easier to find the cord around them but that's just a minor annoyance.,positive
"i bought these over a year ago hoping that a company offering a lifetime warranty would provide a product that would last; i'm on my third pair. when they work, they are ok, but every 6 months the sound quality becomes so painfully bad i send them back. i suggest throwing your money elsewhere.",negative
"We have a split family, and so it's great to have amazingly clear headphones that can fold up, that they love and move easily between homes without getting damaged. Great purchase!",positive
I bought these for my husband and he loves them.  We are both more comfortable using the over the ear earphones rather than the ear buds that came with our Ipods.  He uses them for home and travel.,positive
"Impressive set for the money, but obviously not professional quality. It does indeed catch hair and can hurt to pull off at times. If you want a good cheap headset, this is an impressive option for the price range it's in.",positive
"Pros- Great Sound!!, Portable, Incredibly Comfortable, they just look coolCons- Not so durable, cord feels cheapI saw these on CNET as some of the best headphones along with ones that cost 100's of dollars and thought I'd give them a try.  I am not disappointed, they look great and sound even better.  They fold up to a small size too and can fit in your pocket.  They even come with a nice leather carrying pouch.",positive
"I had a pair when I was in college back in the mid '70s and they were tops then.Great sound hi and low...not for deep mega bass as it will not carry the bass punch. All others...get your KOSS on and enjoy comfortable headphones that are lightweight and custom fit to your ears and head for rich, full sound.",positive
"I may not be a audiophile, but these headphones sound great! I was surprised by the deep bass in this headphone. Some may be put off by it, but I personally enjoy it. Don't be fool by the picture of the Portapro. They are quite thin and small when collapsed. These are definitely not headphones that you should be bouncing around in since it is so flimsy. Overall, for the price, these are great sounding headphones for the price",positive
"I wanted a pair of headphones that were lightweight, convenient to carry in my daily-use sling bag, and offered decent sound while being affordable. This set meets all of my criteria and I'm very pleased with them.",positive
"These earphones have been around a long time for a reason. Although not as clear as Bose noise-canceling earphones, you cannot beat these earphones for the money. They work very well with an iPod. The bass is especially good, and the music itself is a lot more precise than with the normal iPod earbuds. These earphones are well worth the money.",positive
"Koss PortaPro Headphones with Case broke on me after a year or so of use.... The cable in particular. Cheaply made cables, go with V-Moda",negative
"Sounds good, but not great.  Will do the job.  Would not recommend for music. what else can I say about them?",positive
Night and day difference between these and either of my old Sony headphones. Blows away Nano earbuds. Money well spent.,positive
"I have been debating to buy these for a long time. Finally I did and I am very happy I did.Sound is the best I have heard from this size headphones and it is also much more comfortable than I first thought it would be.I cannot tell how it looks, since I am wearing it. But who cares if the sound is so good.",positive
"My girlfriend swears that these are the best headphones she's ever had. Call me crazy, but I feel as though they're starting to sound better than my Grado SR-80s too.",positive
they work well and seem very strong. more than enough length on the cord and extremely great sound.,positive
Surprising good sound for the money. These things sound too good to be used for workouts. They have foam earpads and those thing will get nasty with sweat. I use these at work and I couldn't be happier with them.,positive
Who woulda guessed that the best sounding headphones under $100 would be a portable version?,positive
Excellent sound for the money. I only got to use them for a short time and wife discovered them. She loves them and won't give them back.,positive
"I got these to replace my 4 yr old Senn px 100 which suddenly got broken at the miniplug, these are not as comfortable as the Px 100 but they do sound great and give you more bass because they are tighter against your ears but with an offer from another site which ended costing me just $5.00 i could not pass them up. They're also very sensitive which makes them ideal for Ipods and other portable devices.",positive
"These headphones are some of the best I've ever had!  Sound quality and comfort are excellent.  Where have they been all my life?  If you are considering purchasing these headphones don't hesitate, just do it.  They are well worth the money!",positive
"My dad has had them for 10 years, they still work as if they were new. My bro has them, I've had them for a year... And have gotten 4 people to get them too.Nothing beats them, period. They deliver an incredible sound performance, feel great, don't leak too much, isolate a fair amount of surrounding noise, are unbreakable and extremely portable.Get them with no hesitation.",positive
"At first my son wasn't sure about the retro look of these head phones.  Now that he saw them in person, he wears them everyday.  First pair came and the right didn't work.  Amazon quickly exchanged it.  Great deal",positive
"Recommended by CNET, these headphones are light, portable, and have the best sound I've heard in this price range.I originally bought them for a laptop, and now I use them on every audio device I own. Great product, excellent price.",positive
"the sound is great, the fit is great, but the cushions are wearing off after while...well guess that is kinda expected and falls under normal wear and tear",positive
I JUST NEEDED AN IMPROVEMENT FOR HOME LISTENING WHILE ON MY COMPUTER. THESE ARE BETTER THAN MY OLD ONES AND AVOIDS ALL THE POPPING SOUND.,positive
"I agree that quality-wise and comfort-wise and portability-wise they are very good headphones. But they slipped off my hands one day and broke.Update: On the other hand, I mailed them back to Koss and got them replaced, no questions asked,",neutral
"These are outstanding headphones for the price, with excellent response across the frequency spectrum, and especially robust bass for such a small, lightweight set.  A friend recently visited me with a just purchased set of large, over-the-ear type headphones.  Though his cost nearly three times as much he was chagrined to find, after listening to a comparison, that the Koss headphones sounded better. A lifetime guarantee never hurts, either.",positive
"I wear glasses and am very picky about over the head headphones. This one has nice design with support at the temple to relieve pressure at the ears, so doesn't push on the frame. Sound isn't bad either. I use it at office and when i go out for walks during the day and it feels comfy for extended periods of use.",positive
"After reading a very positive review of these headphones in Computer Shopper Magazine I decided to buy three for use in my workshops and classes.I like their light weight, compactness, and great sound quality. Over time they may not take the abuse some of my students will subject them to. For now I am very pleased with them.",positive
"Got a couple of these for $25 each and my wife and I use them to watch Netflix and such. They are very good for what they are. Comfortable: secure without being tight. Easy to fold up for protection. Open phones make it possible for us to make comments to each other while watching (not possible with higher quality earbuds we have.) Especially if you find them at this price, go for it!",positive
"I adore these headphones. They are definitely the best portable/lightweight headphones I have used. Amazing frequency response across the entire range. Very comfortable, even if you're wearing glasses. The lifetime warranty is a big plus too.",positive
"I had a pair of these and broke them then sent for another pair,the replacement pair was not made the same and don't sound as good as my old pair,these are made more cheaply by far and are not near as good as there old model",negative
"Not even sure writing a review can do these headphones justice, exceptional; is the first word that comes to mind. These are not just good for the price, they are just good. There is always a satisfying feeling I get when I feel like I received more than I payed for, and that is exactly what I received here. Very highly recommended.",positive
"Excellent product in every way.  This product is light, easy to use, comfortable and excellent sound quality.  All in all worth the money.",positive
"Get the SportaPros instead.  They look better, can be worn in a street configuration, cost less, and sound exactly the same.",positive
"These are ugly as sin, but comfortable to wear, and the sound quality is excellent - so much better than the Sony's I replaced with these!",positive
I bought these headphones thinking I was moving up slightly from my Koss Sportapros. Wrong! They are a half step down in sound quality.  Specs say they should be at least as good but in reality they have a 'tinnier' sound.,negative
I ordered these for an upcoming cruise to use on the plane and the ship both. Have tried them out on my laptop and for their size they sound great. Not as nice as the noise cancelling ones that I keep at my desk at work but then again their not as big and bulky as those either.,positive
I know these headphones are not as cool as Dr. Dre's but they have excellent sound and bass. They are comfortable to wear and store easily. Highly recommended.,positive
These Koss headphones are well priced and nice audio quality for MP3 quality recordings. Not good for noisy environments since they are open style and relatively small but very comfortable for long sessions of use.,positive
If you don't have these headphones then you bought the wrong pair.Bose is nice these are nicer. Bose cost 299.00 these are under 50.00 and sound better.No they are not noise canceling. Yes they are more comfortable.Okay so they are the ugly ducklings of headphones but they sound awsome.  These are my third pair. I just wear them to death.They Rock the head!,positive
"This is the 4th pair of these headphones. THE CONNECTOR PROBLEM has been fixed andthe sound continue s tobe freat. The 6nit curls up into easily transported ball. I can, t imagine flying withojt them.",positive
Fro the price these are hard to beat. I love the retro look and the sound quality will far surpass anything at this price point. Lifetime warranty as well.,positive
"3rd set, what else can i say lol ... they have always been a little heavy on the base but as a work horse they are perfect",positive
"Porta Pros can be broken easily but mostly is snapped back ,Audio Technica Under $ 1oo great too for under $",positive
"I was reasonably happy with the sound and comfort, but after a year of use, there's a loose connection near the plug that makes one channel cut out.  I'm really sick and tired of the disposable nature of every pair of headphones I buy.",negative
"I have been using these for about a month now. I have done some traveling, working out, and simple listening at work with the Porta Pros and I love them so far. The bass is great, the sound quality is wonderful for a tiny portable set of headphones, and they are comfortable on my ears.I would definitely buy another pair.",positive
"I've owned these for 5 years and they still sound great.  Lifetime warranty, crisp sound, good base for portables, sturdy, comfortable.  Get them.",positive
"I am disappointed with the sound quality from this headphone. It does output strong bass, but overall sound is muffled. The high is very weak, barely audible. I prefer the Koss KSC75 and Sennhauser PX100 for they both produce a more balanced sound than the PortaPro.",neutral
"I find earbuds to be very uncomfortable. These Koss Portapros were perfect for replacing the earbuds that came with my MP3 player. They are comfortable to wear, have great sound for the price and have a little stylish pizazz. They are easy to fold up and put into a suitcase or purse for travel. I'm very happy with my choice.",positive
"these have very good sound.  relatively comfortable on head.  I like being able to hear surrounding sounds, so I appreciate that.",positive
I've had two pair of these.  Lost the first pair and replaced them.  Light weight and great sounding and easy to store with a life time replacement warranty.  You just can't go wrong.,positive
"Bought these to replace a pair that gave up the ghost after 25 years. Best investment then, and now. A classic like this should never die. Hopefully they never will.",positive
"Fair sound, great price, and the collapsed form factor makes them quite transportable.Will update this review in a few months after seeing how they hold up.",positive
My family is hard on headphones. This is the only pair of headphones of any type in my household that has made it six months. The Koss PortaPros are comfortable and have a very transparent sound. Highly recommended.,positive
"These may be a throwback to the seventies, but the sound is great. The only concern you might have is that they don't block out much outside sound and, since the cups are open, they allow those around you to hear what you're listening to if you really have it cranked up",positive
"Yep, it's old style that is back in-style!  These are the best sound quality reproduction, lightest, easy on the ears headphones I have ever purchased.  Great for the laptop, MP3 player, stereo system or your TV.  Koss has not changed a thing in over what 30 years I think and now I know why.  They work great!  Check this out.. my 17 y.o. was shocked at the quality he didn't want to give them back to me. haha!",positive
"Still love the Porta Pros, which play in the much more expensive leagues when it comes to sound. Koss really nailed it with the Porta Pros, which are much more valued in Europe, I found out from a friend. Excellent warm sound, a bit bassy but not enough to ruin the experience, not at all.",positive
"Sound is. Great.Price is great.A little fragile, but take care and it will give you a light weight headset with full sound.",positive
"I got these because the low price, good sound quality and they are collapsable.They do all those, they were a good price and good sound but man these are very uncomfortable. They pinch at the eyes and my hair would be caught in them all the time. I stopped using them all together and now they just collect dust.",negative
"Four star sound quality for under $50. Very comfortable, with solid construction. The review on cnet.com is spot on. I could not be more pleased with this purchase.",positive
"Title of this review pretty much sums it up. The bass is a bit too heavy, for my liking. However, the overall quality is very good.  My son took a listen and he loved them.  He and his sister have a birthday coming up, so I think I will pick up a couple pair. Good value for the money.",positive
Sound is good overall but these don't wear well.  Miniplug connector shorts out and earpads keep popping out of their cheap plastic plates.,negative
"I gave it 5 stars because for the price, these are about the best headphones you can get sans a good sale. I recommend it to anyone who wants a great pair of headphones you don't need an amp with.",positive
"I have been looking for good moderately priced headphones for some time. Koss offers a an excellent product.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.  Great bass, highly enjoyable sound.  Sounds a little heavy but still very listenable.  Please replace those ear buds and enjoy great music. Highly recommended.",positive
These headphones sound great and the price can't be beat.  I use them frequently.  I did not give them 5 stars because they can get a bit uncomfortable after extended use (2+ hours) and they do very little to block the sound from being heard by anyone close by.,positive
You know how noisy the NYC subway is? This product is totally amazing block out the noise but still can hear the announcement. Nice deep base too.,positive
"Koss PortaPro is light and sounds very good but not spetacular, of course you do not expect it to be at the price. A great value.",positive
"Happy with Koss PortaPro. Light, comfortable, adjusts easily, great sound quality, while allowing to hear a phone next room ringing.What Porta name has to do with it, beats me. Not sure what to do with the little bag enclosed, or the fatter adaptor bushing that came with it, but a nice touch.Happy ears.",positive
This sound much better than Sennheiser PX 100 (owned for about 2 years). It is comfortable on me but I just don't like style. PX100 look better.,positive
Amazing sound at an amazing price.  They are more bass heavy than the KSC75. Together they compliment each other very well!,positive
"A classic headphone that should be in everyone's collection ..These headphones have remained the same for the last 20 over years ...Recently, it has finally been made to allow iPhone users to enjoy these with the mic function.",positive
"So many good reviews so I will keep it shortI have 2 models of Koss,Koss Porta-Pro (semi-open design, bass is plenty, light and easy on you ears) these are very comfortable and I am wearing them now :) Koss ProDJ100 (Closed design, a bit more detailed and more of a solid bass but not boomy) I find I use these for gaming allot as well as Music and find them Very Clear :)",positive
"Great shape, lightweight, good sound for inexpensive price.I love hearing bass, high notes, low notes, without being tortured by a different song coming on next on my music mix only to blow my ears out - never happens with these headphones.  Quality, easy to wear, they don't give you that feeling that you want to throw them because your ears won't hurt!",positive
Awesome low freq definition. Highs are equally good. For the price ..its absolutely unbeatable. Haven't yet found anyone beat these old babies. I had already tried some good stuff like the Klipsch custom 3. Porta Pro rules,positive
"Ok, i searched for some headphones that were Over-Earred and durable...these headphones are look and sound Excellent! I can't believe i used to have a pair of Sony MDR-zx100, i know you can't compare the two, but these headphones are my personal favorite headphones that feel and sound amazing in my ears. 5-stars! Thanks Amazon!",positive
Great headphones.  Comfortable but not especially lite weight.  I would purchase again.  I like the single cord.  xxx xxx xxxx,positive
"Wish I would have bought a different pair, as now I'm back on here searching for replacements.The sound of these is decent, but you'll find the cushions fall apart quickly and the pair will end up in a landfill after little use.Do yourself a favor and buy something more durable.",negative
"These Koss headphones are such a great buy. Less than $20 and u get a very comfortable fitting set and great sound too. These, of course, do not have audiophile quality,  but for the everyday Joe who wants good sound and fit at a great price these are the ticket. ;)",positive
"I suppose you shouldn't expect ""spectacular"" sound at this price.  The headphones are well made and comfortable.  All in all, worth the money.  I'm satisfied.",neutral
"The first time I bought these was about 6 years ago. They are still working just like new, without any distortion. Comfort of these is amazing. Few days ago I have ordered another pair and some ear cushion replacement. The best headphones for the price!",positive
I have these hooked up to my computer because I listen to Radio and watch NetFlex while I shop or read.  These work great as far as blocking the TV noise.,positive
"It's good, not as good as my other senheiser ones, but for the price it's really good, it compares with headphones that cost 2-3 times more, if the size does not matter. well isolated from outside world sound.",neutral
"I trusted the Koss name that these would sound decent, but was surprised they sound as good, and are as comfortable as they are. I have a much more expensive set of a different brand and these sound comparable, and are definitely more comfortable. (These were a Christmas gift for my mom... she's very happy with them, too.)",positive
"Ugly as hell but they work well. I wouldn't wear them outside. I've been falling asleep with them on for maybe 8 days now and they haven't broken. Not uncomfortable to sleep with. Very light weight and feel good on my head and ward. Again, in case I wasn't clear.... they are really freaking ugly!",positive
I have had the Koss UR -20 headphones for over a year.  I used them for studio recording and mixing. I use them with my headphone amp to make them sound better. The sound is balanced in these headphones.I do like the build quality of these headphones. I use these as my back up pair of headphones.  I recently upgraded to the TASCAM TH02.,positive
"Really nice pair of headphones (replacing an older set of Koss's, destroyed by my cat) - robust bass, etc.  Ear coverage good,  rugged cord.  Looks like a decent pair that should last a long time (cat permitting).",positive
"For this price they are very good. They are boomier than the Koss porta pro but they completely cover the ear.really well for watching movies or TV. Musically, they are fine just not as clean as the Porta-Pros.",positive
"I use Bose when travelling for the noise cancellation, but I don't need to leave the Bose around so the cat can play with it at home.This is a great substitue.  The over-the-ear padding is comfy and seals external noise from getting in.  Perhaps not as neatly as a $300 pair of Bose, but eminently reasonable for hanging around home.  A great bargain to boot!  Thanks Koss - even your cheap ones are fabulous.",positive
"These have huge ear cups, making them extraordinarily comfortable. The cord is much longer than most, giving you a lot of room to move around. For the price, nothing beats these. As a side note, I wear hearing aids, and even with those in, these are still roomy and comfortable.",positive
I purchased these to use for emtal detecting but ended up useing them for gaming on my laptop in peace also. For the price they are great and I have been abuseing them to see if they can handle stress from heavy use. They have held up great and if they ever do fall I'll replace them with the same unit.,positive
"I must say, these headphones are definitely unique. The drivers are huge, and so are the headphones themselves. These are insanely comfortable, lightweight, and easy to use.Audio quality is the major problem here. These sound very sub-par compared to other headphones in this price range. I would not recommend these whatsoever.If you are looking for headphones in this price range, I would go for the Monoprice 8323. Best headphones you can get under $50.",neutral
"I bought these for my father who is temporarily bedridden. They are ideal for the rough treatment this entails-lots of cord tugging, pulling and crushing. They block out noise better than the open-ear style too.",positive
I was expecting a decent bass but the R80 is quite lean in bass. Mids and treble are balanced to my ears but the lack of bass makes the R80 not suitable for listening to my music. Build quality is better than I thought though.,neutral
I use these to monitor playback during recording sessions. They sound fine and are lightweight and comfortable. Three more words.,positive
I like the rounded shape of these and the way they cover my ears are comfortable they fit nicely and are affordable.,positive
"I got these because my noise-canceling phones (also Koss) died.  While they are repairing/replacing, I got these.  They are good for my stereo.  If, however, you use them in the PC and want outside noise blocked, they are not as good as the noise cancelling ones.",positive
"If you bought the most expensive headphones you can, they would not be a lot better than these. The price was great. They got to my house five days before promised. Overall the sound quality, price, and speed of delivery were all reasons to come back to Amazon.",positive
"For the money, these are excellent. I'm not very discriminating so can't comment on fidelity; I use these for my electric piano. They cover my ears well, provide clear sound and are comfortable for extended (one hour or so) wear. Also they're cool looking....",positive
These are really good headphones I had the Cl-20 when I was locked up and these are the sameones but they just aren't clear. You can't beat this quality of this headphone for this price. I have bought alot of different pairs that cost more and they can't match koss. I love them and yes I would recommend!!!,positive
I bought these for my daughter for Christmas.  They broke about 6 weeks ago.  Only one speaker works.  They were sent off to the landfill soon after.  I wouldn't buy them again.,negative
"I really do like these headphones.They sound pretty good.Are very comfortable.  This is rare for me as I have a big head.They have a very nice coiled long cord.The only negative is that they are ugly.but hell, they are inexpensive to :)",positive
"Got these for my wife. I have listend to them too. Great sound. Full range and bass. A lot better than the ear plugs. Also, cancels out a good bit of noise.",positive
"These don't adjust small enough for me to wear.  I've bought lots of headphones over the years without issue - if you are a big person, these might be fine.",negative
These are ok. Sound is ok . I'm not impressed at all but they work. My biggest complaint is they are lose on my head .. So they must be made for a giant head. Can't adjust them smaller.. They cover your whole ear but since they are loose can hear all the background noise so not good for a Dj..,neutral
"Positives: ComfortableNegatives: Sound floods in and out, and is of $8 walkman-era quality.Summary: I wanted to support an originally Milwaukee-based business, but these are in every way Chinese second-thoughts for the budget crowd. Spend more money for something with better isolation, sound, and construction.",neutral
"Right, you can spend a lot of money on head-phones, and not hear much more. These are well worth twice the price.",positive
"It's a slightly snugger fit than I'd like, and my office is warm enough that I get warm with headphones on, but they sound good and feel good when on.Update:  After using them for a while and trying other headphones, these sounds pretty muddy.  Maybe they changed over time.  But for the price they're still a pretty good deal.",neutral
I like these headphones in that they do cover my ears and fit my (large) head.  Good sound and comfortable enough :)  They seem well enough made.,positive
"The very best feature about this feature is that the ear cups are huge. I've seen some previous reviews complaining that they were too big, but I think they're terrific. I have big ears, so these are perfect for me.The only CON is that the headphones can easily adjust the sliders. When you pull the headset to fit your head, the sliders that change the head size will shrink.Overall: 9/10",positive
I use headphones for TV viewing so as to not bother my wife.  These over the ear headphones fit excellent over the ear.  No pressure on my head.  Block out other sound excellent.,positive
"Not the most expensive brand, top end noise cancelling headphones.  But these work great with Lumix and microphone in a crowd.  Cuts a lot of the ambient sound to make hearing dialogue easier in a crowded setting.",positive
I use these headphones at home for casual use.  They are perfect for that situation.  They are very comfortable and the sound quality is good for this price.,positive
good sound quality for such a low price. I like that the cable comes out of only the left side.,positive
"These are great headphones for watching the tube and casual listening at home or work. They're comfortable and block out external noise really well. Lifetime warranty to boot! They sound good - smooth, flat  and full - but are not ""audiophile"" quality. You could do a lot worse for a lot more jing! Stick with Koss, they know ""cans!""",positive
"It was surprised at the build quality of these headphones.  Very rugged great bass and treble, and they fit over my big head quite comfortable.  You will not find a bitter headphone for the price.",positive
"Sound quality is good, very little isolation though.  Very comfortable to wear.  Construction is very poor though.  Broke ear cups easily.  Would not buy again due to poor construction.",neutral
"$20 headphones, and they work great. I honestly believe that this is the best of what I can buy with the money. I like how durable it is.",positive
"These are quality headphones. I use them around the house. They look funny with the knobs on top sticking out, but I don't care about looks. If I did I would have shelled out an extra 200 for some beats. Alas, if you want sound quality similar to Dr. Dre Beats without the ""cool"" look go for these!",positive
"I needed an inexpensive set of headphones.  Several manufacturers offer inexpensive headphones but I learned a long time ago that Koss makes the best headphones.  These headphones are built like a tank and will last a good long time.  I wasn't concerned with getting the best sound money could buy.  If I wanted better sound, I would have purchased a more expensive set of headphones.  For what I needed, these headphones are the best.",positive
My girlfriend only had these for like two weeks and they just fell apart on her all of a sudden.,negative
"The title sums it up.  For whatever reason, I can't get these things to sit flat on my head.  The earpieces seem to fit snug at the top of my ear, then lift off my face at the bottom.  This prevents me from getting a good seal, so I get more background noise coming in.  Aside from that, the sound is good, and for the price they perform a lot better than I expected.",neutral
"I am not an audiophile and use these phones for listening to SSB receivers. They fit nicely, sound good, and are comfortable. Excellent for the price.",positive
"Nice headphones for the money. Superb bass response and clean sound free of interferrence from outside noise.The 8-foot cord is awkward because it is coiled and constantly tugs on the earcups. After more than 15 minutes of wear, cups tend to go sweaty inside. It would help to have an uncoiled cord as an option.",neutral
for the price you will not find a better pair. sound quality is top a+ nice fit also what more can i say,positive
&#8226; They cover your ears completely and a sit a little tight but comfortable&#8226; The sound quality is not bad at all for music and videos&#8226; Easy to adjust but no way to lock it&#8226;  The wire is long enough to put the computer on a table and watch videos without leaning forward,positive
"Gave these as a stocking stuffer and well received. They were worn during workout, and were very comfortable as well as pretty decent sound...especially for the stocking stuffer price!",positive
I use these with my MP3 player to listen mostly to audio books and podcasts.  They stay on and are comfortable with a good length for the cord.  Time will tell if they become my favorite headsets.,positive
"The headphones provide great sound throughout their sound range.  Even though they are not over ear headphones the bass is solid, and always there without downing out midrange or the high notes.  They can be worn for extended periods of time without fatigue, and your ears do not sweat.  I would strongly suggest incurring the additional expense for an in-line volume cotrol to watch movies.  Since your not next to your receiver it makes volume adjustments much easier.",positive
"Good sound, would certainly buy another set...I just might soon, for back up. Excellent sound. I have some live recordings and sometimes find myself looking around for planes flying...but it's just in the recording! They might look kind of stupid, but they sound great and are very sturdy for work outs. good score!Jan 09 updatestill going strong. Use them for my workouts. Got that retro Starsky vibe.",positive
"These headphones have teriffic sound regardless of their low price. I own a few pairs of quality headphones, including a pair of Etymotic er4p's. The Koss Sporta Pro 'phones sound great and the price is fantastic. The bass is incredible and the highs and mids are great as well. These 'phones are worth the price, and then some.",positive
These things are fantastic for the price and portability. I bought them because I hate ear buds and wanted something with more oomph but without the clumsiness of wrap around headsets so I could walk and listen to music on my cell phone. Very nice bass and treble with a little loss on the mid range. I have always loved Koss and these are no exception. Recommended,positive
"Pros: Fits well. Comfortable, not in ear.  Adjustability has advantages and I can wear a hat with them.Cons: Not good Koss quality sound.Sum: Good workout phones if you prefer not to stick anything in your ear. Recommend but only for niche that it fills.",positive
"These Koss SportaPhones are great. (the name is a bit corny) Comfy on the head in the usual position and in the back of the head setting.They sound very clean, and very clean in the midrange, and have provide some surprising base notes.A great buy the $28.00!",positive
"I wasn't expecting much but these sound great!  I'm no audiophile but I am a speaker junkie and these sound good with jazz and rock.  And feel really comfortable on my head.  Not the coolest looking headset in the world but who cares.  I'm ripping the speakers out of this and installing them into a motorcycle helmet.  They play pretty loud with just my Note 3 aux out, btw.",positive
"I tried this for the first time at work. Inmediatly bought one. They are lightweight, excelent of running, great bass.",positive
"The Koss SportaPro Headphones are terrific.  They are Lightweight and can be worn over or behind your head as described.  These phones are fully adjustable for different head sizes.  The cord is 4 feet long. Sound quality is fabulous.  When you consider the low price, these headphones are a truly an amazing bargin.  You cannot go wrong with this one.  Highly recommended.",positive
"Only on-the-ear headphone I have used.  Very comfortable. Highs and midrange are very nice however I expected more bass (may be an ear fit issue).  I  also expected a more compact fold-up. Otherwise, I am very happy with them.",positive
"I have been using SportaPros for over 10 years.  I have gone through 4 pairs (I'm pretty rough on them.)  The sound response is excellent for the price and they fit great (and tight) for when you're training/working out/etc.  Also, you don't look like one of these fools with huge DJ headphones on their heads.",positive
"They stick to my head pretty well while working out at the gym. The foam is a bit coarse, so it's scratchy. I don't think I could wear them all afternoon at a football game, but the bass is excellent, great motivator when doing those situps during a 90 min workout. I would buy them again.",positive
"I love these headphones in behind the head mode (especially now that I know the earpieces can rotate). In over-the-head mode I find the band a little tight. It works, but the earphones barely cover my ears. I have a large head, and doubt most people will have any discomfort using this in over-the-head mode. But I'll likely be using it in behind the head mode even when I'm not outside wearing a hat, just because it's more comfortable.",positive
"I am not an expert as much as the others posting here, all I know is that my original iPod earbuds were quite uncomfortable. I replaced them with this Sportapro and played Joni Mitchell's ""Hejira' on my iPod and it sounded STELLAR.Do be careful handling these as they seem less than rugged.",positive
"I do like the sound, and the fold-up and tuck-away design is handy. I have trouble getting them positioned comfortably when I'm wearing glasses, though. It can be done, but it's troublesome. I think I'll get used to them. Yep, they're ugly, but we know that from the photo, and I didn't deduct stars for that.",positive
"got the original portapros back in the early 80s and been using the successive variants ever since.  nothing beats these for performance vs. value.  I'm a picky listener (mostly classical) and have gone through way too much money buying stereo equipment of all types since the 1960s but these little headphones from Koss have been great ever since the type was introduced.  get some, you will be pleased.",positive
"Koss does it again- I'll never purchase another brand's headphones, ever.  My last 5 have all been Koss and these have held up great.  I also got a set of PortaPros for casual wear.  Love Koss!",positive
"These $20 headphones sound as good or better than many that cost much more. I also think they will be more durable. Only two downsides* They're not pretty* They don't really fit in the included caseStill, they're my favorite portable headphones.",positive
these are possible some of the best knock around headphones i have had! if there is a contender for the Port-a-Pros it's the Sport -a - Pros!!!!!! these headphones are GREAT and very versatile!!!!,positive
"I wanted these phones because they are supposed to work as behind the head or on top of the head. Turned out that when used behind the head, they were a little uncomfortable, so I use them with the band on top. Not exactly what I expected, but they are OK and the sound is good.",positive
"Very comfortable with good sounds high through low. They do cut out at anything 40 hz or below. So Hip Hop will be thin in the lower range. Jazz, Roxk, Classical, And more...they are very comgfortable and snug. Great for walking, beach with Tablet or Phone",positive
"I like the Koss SportPro headphones.  They sound very good for this price range.  They are well made and comfortable. At this price, they are a great value.",positive
"These are great for running or doing outdoor activities without being bulky. They sound great and are easy to wear and to store. I highly recommend for lightweight headphones, and they don't fall out of your ears like ear-buds always do. Good product!",positive
"Worked and sounded pretty good for a few months, then the sound became distorted and every bit of bass was missing.  I am now shopping for a QUALITY replacement for them.-Very Disappointed in Koss",negative
"This Product Koss SportaPro Stereo Headphones, is excelent, sounds great and it,s very affordable for the price that I paid for it, I recommend it very much.",positive
"I took a chance based on other reviews, and was not dissapointed.These provide great sound, especilly for the price.I may consider the closed ear type for noisy coditions, now that I know the sound is great.",positive
"I have tried many other types of headphones, all more expensive, but no others come close as far as comfort and value for exercise or travel. Lifetime warranty on these also. Can't go wrong!",positive
"Great portable headphones for the price. Well balanced sound, nice mix of treble and bass, not too much of either, just right.  Build quality is okay, I am not a fan of the metal headband, but overall they seem like they will last for a good while.",positive
"These are by far the best headphones i have ever used. Agreed they look kinda awkward and arent marvelously comfortably if worn for extended periods of time, but the sounds completely makes up for all that. The bass is perfect.. great treble and mids.No complaint what so ever.",positive
"I bought these based on good reviews like above. The treble detail is good and the bass is solid and warm. Not tight and detailed based like from my Sennheiser 580's but those cans cost ~$200. Only issue I have with them is that the earpieces swivel on a small plastic joint that tends to get looser over time. Eventually, they start falling out a lot. Nice sounding phones but won't take huge amounts of abuse.",positive
"I purchased the Koss Sportapro headphones to use with my IPod Nano.  I was surprised with the overall sound quality.  The sound responsiveness is very good.  The main reason I did not rate them a 5 is they are not quite as comfortable as I would like.  I use them while I exercise, and I find that I have to adjust them for comfort long before I am done.",positive
Excellent sound quality. Fits well over the head or from behind. Lifetime warranty also.,positive
"Koss is still making great products.  I have been buying Koss for over 30 years, and I have no complaints.  Got these for my college son.  He says they work great. They go on top of the ear, which my son likes that better than the ear inserts.  They fold up into a neat little case.",positive
"If you are looking for some eye candy with your music or audio, then I recommend this EQ/Meter. It is really alot of fun to watch your music and/or movies come to life. It is definitely a conversation starter.That said, the audio input and output to analog only. Therefore if you have digital audio, you need to get a converter.Overall, a fun purchase if you are looking for a light show.",positive
"It looks a bit more expensive than just a cheap analog 10-Band Stereo Graphic Equalizer. No audiophile quality here, just an easy EQ solution for your power amp.",positive
"I cannot tell you how wonderful this camera is!  You have to have one!  It will change your life in so many ways--the photos are wonderful with great resolution, movies are exquisitely wonderful!  The sound is just fine.  I love using the diskettes.  The lithium battery is great also--lasts a long,  long time prior to recharge!  All problems of older digital cameras have  been solved with this lovely piece of technological work...",positive
"This camera is a quality product and takes excellent pictures, especially in outdoor lighting.  However, at the cost, I can't give it an exceptional rating.I use this camera to take action sports photos.  If you're close to the action, the camera does a good job.  But, $400 seems so expensive to me, even if that is what the market will bear.",neutral
"My child is a black and white photographer, this unit was a great gift to produce black and white pictures.",positive
A+++++++,positive
Just started exploring the camera. I love the light weight and the auto focus/flash that pops up when required.My only disappointment was that when I got the unit I didn't realize there was a slightly different model available that lets you time/date stamp your photos. If I had known about  that other model I would have ordered it.Bought this camera after  having used my sisters. Can be as simple or complex to use as needed.,positive
"I needed this to be able to power up and use an older version digital camera for one of my children.  This came to me as a new unit and when I plugged it in, it worked as expected.  Thanks.",positive
"The most common application for this type of memory card is a digital camera, but these can also be used with a number of electronic devices, including the HP Jordana, and even your laptop computer with a PC Card adapter.  You can store any type of data on the cartridge, and they can be quickly changed between devices.  I have never had a problem with any of my SanDisk Compact Flash Cards.",positive
"Needed this for older Raymarine electronics in order to perform software upgrade. Worked like a charm, typical excellent quality from SanDisk. Make sure this is what you need before ordering.",positive
"The SanDisk card works perfectly with both my digital camera and Visor Prism's MemPlug card. The MemPlug module, by PiTech, allows a Handspring Visor to use a CompactFlash (or SmartMedia) card as if it were an extension of the hand held's own RAM. I made the mistake of initially purchasing a CompUSA CompactFlash card but had to return it when it proved to be incompatible. The SanDisk is a winner.",positive
"Makes my camera not obsolete.  I had a hard time locating this memory cardfor my old, old, old camera.",positive
"Setup/installation of the camera wasn't perfectly smooth.  The instructions weren't 100% in line with the choices in Windows 98. Once installed, camera works easily.  Picture is not great, but clear.  The  manual focus is not that meaningful. The web update and &quot;watch&quot;  functionality work well.",neutral
I found this camera to have a very easy setup and great picture quality. I am running it on a Windows ME machine and it works wonderfully..,positive
"I bought this because it was in my price range.  The quality isn't great, but it does what I need it to do.If you need a still or video PC camera for school, don't get this one.  Spend the extra money and get a really nice one.  If you just need a PC camera for instant messageing and sharing photos, this is a good camera.",positive
"This is easy to install, easy to update (online), and very very easy to use. Don't expect super high resolution photographic excellence, but if you want to talk via video chat online, take snap shots, or send recorded messages this is the business.More than enough for the avergae computer user, highly recommended.",positive
"Even if you just want this camera for casual use with your computer and are flexible about picture quality, you will probably have headaches installing the drivers.  I gave up on their mouse years ago, and I suggest avoiding this product as well.  I got it as a gift, and I found that with respect to camera, software, and overall quality this product is a loser.",negative
"Hey it's 30 bucks(roundabout). For that, the setup was trouble-free, and using it was a cinch. But personally, I wish for two things: that it wasn't colored white, cuz it get's dirty real easy. U leave it on top of your monitor, the dust collects and......Also, when I used Netmeeting, no matter how much I tried to focus, the pciture wasn't entirely clear. But again, for it's price, this camera is a sweet deal, and pretty cool looking too!",positive

"These don't stop working when I sweat, which all of my other ones would do. love the handy case and the sound is good. I bought another pair I liked them so much.edited on 1-8-12. left earbud stopped working.",neutral
"I've had three pair of these now, going on nearly 10 years.  The only reason I've replaced my previous two pair was because I lost them!  One in a seatback on a plane.  They're quite durable.  The winding case helps avoid the usual wire failures.  The sound is good, not great, but I'm fine with making the trade for durability and convenience.  I laid in a second set as a spare for when I eventually lose them again!",neutral
"I purchased these for sport use, and compared them with a set of Sennheiser earbuds I use at the office. The Sonys are a little more expensive, but they have better sound, more bass response, and fit my ears better. Although I'm a fan of Sennheiser products, in this case the Sony product is superior.",positive
"Like most websites I've looked for these headphones on, they're showing you the picture of the (now discontinued) MDR-V900, but if you look closely at the model number below, it's the cheaper MDR-V900HD.  Don't be fooled.",negative
"Initially bought these phones for home recording.  At first they were a little tight on my wide head, but after a while they broke in and were very comfortable.For recording, I found these phones to accentuate the bass a little too much.However, for ham (amateur) radio, they are excellent for discerning weak signals.A short wave enthusiast would probably also like these phones.",positive
"This is my second pair and I have nothing but good things to say!  Comfortable, good bass depth and very durable. Volume control is a huge plus, especially in the workshop which is where I am most of the time.",positive
Item arrived quickly and in great condition.  I am very satisfied with the headphones and will probably purchase another set in the near future.,positive
For the price the best.  I have 3 pair of these headphones for all my various listening locations?  The volume control works great and very convenient .,positive
"These are the only headphones I use now. I have been so pleased with them that whenever I want a pair I simply go to my previous purchase, click on the link, add them to the cart, and as if by magic, they appear at my doorstep in two days. I use a set at work, a set on the boat, a set for the stereo, a set for the music gear, etc, etc. Love these headphones.",positive
I use these headphones with my Avid mbox mini and since I have set everything up I have stopped using the speakers with my computer as these sound better.  They are comfortable for wearing long periods of time without any complaint.  My wife will steal them to use on her laptop when doing school work for the same quality and comfort reasons.,positive
"These headphones are great at this price! I already have the previous model MDR-V150 which are without the volume control and I wanted one more pair for recording vocals so that the performers can individually set the volume. My only complaint is that there's a certain fatigue after wearing them for more than 4 hours! Overall, the sound is great and very well balanced!",positive
"Excellent price and service.  I like the volume control onin the cabel, comeswith two size input jacks.  2 Meter cabel is just fine for PC Use which I purchased it for.  Excllent product would recommend and will shop vendor again.",positive
These are great headphones for the money. I have a home recording studio and use these when I play. They are light and comfortable and have plenty of bottom end. This is one step up from the MDR-150. The only difference being the inline volume control. These also sound great with my phone or MP3 player.,positive

"These are a great pair of headphones, very sleek and stylish. I'ved use these headphones for years and they have worked without any issues. The sound quality is not the best but is better than most headphones in the same price range. The extra long cable makes it perfect if you are connecting this to a TV in a living room.",positive
The construction is on the frail side but the sound reproduction is superb. It is lightweight and comfortable for long hours.,positive

"These provide excellent sound, comfort and they are fairly durable. A very good sound experience for the price.",positive
"I've been using these at work for 5 years now.  They are sturdy, the sound quality is fine for the price, and they come with a really long cord in case you happen to be running them under a desk into a PC.  These are a great value if you are not looking for high quality sound.",positive
"1/2 the price of my neighborhood electronics store Bestbuy.  That sums it up, it would have been even better with a bag!",positive
I love it!  Nice sound and noise reduction capability... and my friend says the girls them love it too.It got caught in a taxi door and it still keeps on kicking too so that is a plus.,positive

"Sony DJ version of the headset MDR-V500 and up has been great quality in terms of strong cabling material and durable ear piece. My first headset last me more than 10 years. That is with normal wear and tear. Its worth it. The price is not expensive and generally can't be compared with expensive Bose headphones or the higher headset from Sony.  It perfectly price for it purpose, not expensive and works better than the ear bugs piece.",positive
You will be very pleased with the quality of the sound from these headphones.  Good cord length to.  Priced right.,positive
I have been beating these around for 9 years now and they are just as great as the day I bought them.  Still intact no sign of wear and tear.  Love the fold up design.  Glad to see they are still making these.,positive
"These sound awesome, and I am not a DJ.  I was just looking for some old fashioned, ear thumping headphones.  I love the way that they fold up and I love the strength in the cord.  The only negative thing that I have to say is the ear sweat you will suffer from having these on your head as you rock out.",positive
"If it is music, gaming, movies, or whatever, these headphones are great.  Comfortable to wear with high quality music.  The swival ears are great if you need to keep one ear semi open to hear events around you.Only negative would be the ear pieces tend to fit on the ear as opposed to around them.",positive
"... and still going strong. I love these headphones. I've traveled with them a lot. I put them on and I'm transferred to a different world, a tranquil world.I'll buy another pair when these expire. :)",positive
"I bought these in a local store probably in 2002 or 3. They've made it to/from many lans and halfway across the country. They are used on a daily basis and abused from time to time. Never once have I had a complaint about these. Great sound and great build, don't hesitate to purchase.",positive

"I have a set of the Sony MDRV700DJ Studio Monitor Headphones that I use for sound re-inforcement while playing my Bass Guitar. They are incredable and simply can't be beat.  I have used other so-called ""High-end Units"" from other manufacturers and nothing comes close!  I would recommend these headphones for fellow musicians, for audiophiles, for basic music listening.  They simply can't be beat for the sound quality, bass reproduction...",positive
First off these Headphones have the same sound Technology as the Sony Professional Headphones!  The only difference is that these have a DJ style.  I also enjoy the slinky/coil type of cord.  I enjoy the headphones very much!,positive
"I got this for a friend over a year ago & barely now they're showing signs of use. Sony deff made a good job on this one.The bass lines are so neat & clear...and no matter how high you put the volume, still sounds clean.",positive
"Like other reviews, the swivel points for the ear cups are plastic and will eventually break.  Mine did.  Buyer's remorse scale: 9.5 (10 being worst)Don't waste your money!",negative
"These headphones are very clean.  Highs are crisp and lows offer no distortion.  However, the low end response is not so good.  At normal listening levels, I would like a lot more bass response and it's not there.  If you crank up the volume, then the bass starts coming in.  But I don't listen to music that way.Hope this helps in making a decision.  If I had it to do over, I would have bought something different.",neutral
"Sound quality is amazing. Noise reduction is pretty good too, can't hear anything once I have these bad boys on.",positive
I bought a pair at a box store at least 7 years ago. I think there great. I live in an apartment now and I use them a lot more than I did when I had my own place.,positive
"I always order these. They seem to last longer for me than they do for other people. Maybe it's in the care, I don't know. I keep using these and they never fail me.",positive
"For the price, these headphones are very hard to beat in terms of sound and comfort. I highly recommend them.",positive
"I will keep it simple folks! I bought them, I tried them, I love 'em! Very versatile so far! I'm no sound expert, but I know what I like! And these Sony's are great! I also plan to try the Beyerdynamics 770Ts with 250 ohms and compare sound quality and comfort! Shipping was fast and my phones were in mint condition upon arrival! Thanks again Amazon!",positive

"I brought these headphones for my son. He wanted a DJ type headphone. I compare it to my Denon AHD 1001S. The Sony sound presentation was ""GOOD"", however I was not engaged with the music and recording like with the Denon. The Sony does produce an accurate sound presentation. The sound didn't have a heavy colored bass or treble (Neutral). The Sony may not be an audiophile headphone, definitely it is a great studio monitor DJ headphone.",neutral
"Really good set of cans...very good overall...all genres.  These things need power to perform at there best, amp hungry.  They are not my Ultrasone PRO 550 or PRO 750...but they make an awesome set for a family set headphone.",positive
Wonderful wearing this headphone for long period of time ( I used it for more than two hrs most of the time).  Clear and has great bass when turned up volume.  Highly recommend this item.,positive
These ear phones are very comfortable and the sound quality is really good too.,positive
My headphones are a bit worse for wear (my fault) but these are my go-to headphones when I really want to enjoy a piece. Good frequency response high and low. Very comfortable even with all-day use.,positive
"The headphone cup that goes around your ear is nice for the plane because it eliminates much of the ambient noise that causes jet-lag lethargy, but if you want a better audio experience buy the Sony MDR V700 headphones. They are a little less cuppy on your ear, but the sound is far superior.",positive
"These headphones are terrific. I use them all the time for listening to music and watching movies. I have had them for a few years now, and they still work just as good as the day i bought them. They have a nice long  cord, so you don't have to sit close to your receiver or dvd player. If you  are looking for a set of headphones, these are one of the best for its  price range.",positive
These are good headphones for the price. They deliver brilliant fidelity across the audio spectrum. I was really impressed by both the bass and treble reproduction and response and their ability to envelop my ears diminishing outside sounds. I use these with a Yamaha receiver. They deliver very good sound with this receiver. The receiver can play a factor on how sound and music is reproduced through these headphones. That is something you should consider when choosing any headphones.,positive
"Comfy to wear, sound great, sturdy enough. Wrap around the ears nicely to keep ambient noise at a minimum, keep the good smooth highs and round bass in. About the same as the V6s I had for 20 years, but more comfortable.",positive
"I purchased these three years and four months ago, they still sound as good as day one. All sound is crisp and clear.  They are comfortable for many hours. I got them for sixty -six bucks. The ear foam has started to wear out and flake off so I bought replacements, for eight bucks. Hope to get many more years service out of them.",positive
"I'm pretty sure that I've had these headphones since 1992. I can't believe they still make the same model (mine look exactly like the model pictured).After fourteen years, the material covering the foam padding is starting to crack, but they still sound great.",positive
"I paid like $70 for these. I should have bought a few but I didn't know they price would jump so high. I paid less than half of what they are currently going for on Amazon. They just happen to have a frequency response that my meditation CDs require. So, I bought them for that purpose. They do a great job and they're also high quality headphones. What more could I ask for?",positive
"i had to return these after one day because they were huge on the ears. there was no way to adjust the headband, so it kept falling off my head. i got irritated so i just returned it.sound quality was pretty good, but i didnt have them long enough to say anything else about this.",positive
"These are good, blocks off all sound so you stay focused, so when I'm in grind mode in the studio I'm in GRIND MODE. Only thing is, if listening on high volume in a tight place, like the car, EVERYONE will hear what your listening to. EVERYONE. Just wish somehow it would stay within the headphones, and you.",positive
Sony headphones deliver great sound no matter if you plug it in a stereo or portable device. I love the crisp sound.,positive
"I've been in the broadcasting business for over 15 years and these are the best headphones I've ever used.  It took some convincing to invest in them, since I usually bought cheaper headphones.  But the cheap ones last a few months, and the Sony MDR-V6s last years.  You won't be sorry with this headphones!",positive
"From the start had to fiddle with plug to get good sound.At first, I thought it was the computer jack, but as timewent on it got worse and worse. Did some experimentingand determined it was definitely loose wiring in the plug.You spend this kind of money you at least expect it to bemanufactured well. I'm done with Sony. I've had other badexperiences recently, they just aren't what they used to be.",negative
"These are not the real deal. They are fakes. The so called 40mm diaphragm don't sound good at all. I've had a real pair of V600s, and they sound 300% better than these.Do not waste your time or money on this product..",negative
I'VE BEEN READING  REVIEWS WHERE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WEARING OUT THESE  PHONES AND BUYING A SECOND PAIR. I BOUGHT A NEW PAIR OF EAR PADS FROM SONY ON LINE FOR LESS THAN $30 INCLUDING S&H AND TAX. JUST AS GOOD AS NEW!,positive
The quality of sound on these things is amazing. Good bass and amazing clarity. I am hearing things in my music I've never heard before!,positive
"Best Sony product I have purchased lately. My 7 year old has Autism and we bought this for one of his CD sessions. It was recommended by the therapist group and they are very responsive with sound and fit my son just fine, drowning out distracting sounds around him while he is listening to his CDs. I want to get a pair myself!",positive
"I've had these headphones for at least 8 years. They've been stepped on constantly, thrown around, used for countless gaming/music listening hours, and even had my dog chew on them for a bit.

This one was the best --- lightweight, adjustable metal headband (not plastic), extremely comfortable, small unbreakable mic &#34;wand&#34;, easily accessible earpiece volume and mute control, and mic volume control, which is not common for headsets in this price range.  I used the previous headset for years until I moved overseas.  Now I'm back, I am delighted to have another one.",positive
Quality of headset is good. Does not have standard 3.5 jack plug as adverstised. Would suggest only as replacement for other Plantronic product and not cross usage.,neutral
I ordered two different headsets from Amazon so we can have one upstairs in my office and one downstairs where my other half works when he works from home.  I just took this one out of the box and so far is working as it should.,positive

"I had a Plantronics headset before, and they've definitely improved on what I already liked:  great sound quality--most people say they can't tell I have any background noise even when I'm in the car, and comfortable headset.I use the over-the-ear version of it so I can hear best, and they've added a mute button on the headset cord, as well as the volume control.A great value for the money, and hard to improve on for any price.",positive
The sound quality is the best of any home headset I've ever used. I bought another brand at a RadioShack and it sounded HORRIBLE.But the manufacturing quality is bad. It only lasted for a year before it broke and I had to buy a new one (I guess that's how Plantronics makes extra profits).,positive
"Product arrived in time and worked successfully. It came with no documentation, although it was fairly easy to figure out.",positive
"There seems to be some conflicting information about using this headset with the iPhone among the existing reviews. For the record, the jack on this headset is not the right size for use with the iPhone 4.",neutral
I have used this very model headset for many years and yes after several years they do wear out as do many things but when I had to replace the one I had I found it here at Amazon.com and not only were they new but they were the least expensive I could find anywhere. Some site were asking as much as 4 times what I paid here.. Thanks once again Amazon.com,positive
I've had this model for years. I'm happy to keep buying them when they wear out because the sound quality is good and the mute button on the cord is a lifesaver when office interruptions happen in the middle of a phone call. I've used this model for over 8 years with a Radio Shack headset amplifier and the Nortel and Polycom phone systems. Love it.,positive
It is nice that it gives the option to use either over the head or over the ear. The padded speaker cover is comfortable and will not wear out like the foam kind. I used the switch to turn the the mic on and off a lot and has made it much more useful to me.,positive
"This is the third time I have ordered a Plantronics product. I had to return two of them. Ist set of earhones just didn't work and the latest was the Plantronics Over-Head/Ear Headset, M175C. Out of the box the headset had a loose connection. The slightest movement caused it to cut out. Returned the product to the seller.",negative
"This headset is my favorite. I've used them for years and they wear out from use, which is to be expected. I hope they keep producing it. If the headband is too tight for you, just bend it a little. It also comes with an ear loop. Great incoming and outgoing volume controls.",positive
"For the price, you can't beat this little headset.  The mute switch sets it apart from other headsets, which is a must-have feature for conference calls.It is also comfortable, and in my expererience, fairly durable.  I've used this headset for 2 years with no complaints.  In fact, I'm listening to a conference call on it right now. :-)",positive
"I find these headsets perfect for use on my home telephone.  It allows me to make phone calls while I'm doing other things, whether it's doing dishes, or typing on the computer.  The party on the other side never knows I'm using a headset, as the voice quality is perfect.",positive
"I paid a little more for these than another pair, thinking the Plantronics brand and the boom would enhance sound quality for those I talk to. Actually, I've been told the sound of my voice is slightly less clear than the piece I had been using at half the price. So would not recommend.",negative
"I've had this gadget for a while now.  It was well thought out and it works well.  I'm completely pleased.  I made my decision based on the comments by Amazon reviewers.  Thanks for the good advice, people!",positive
"The headset fits the standard 2.5mm jack found on many cordless phones. The fit is comfortable and the sound is fine, both incoming and outgoing. However, mine broke just shy of two months after I bought it.",negative
I have hearing aids so I needed one that just laid on the ear.  This works fine even with my iPad.,positive
"I was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition, but was lured by the half-price price tag when compared to a new headset. I envisioned all sorts of shortcomings, but when it arrived I was astounded at the excellent condition of the headset. It is clean. No scratches. No faded labeling. It looked to be brand new. Oh yeah...it works great, too.&#128077;",positive
now that I have used it for sometime now I can say that it holds up to what I put it through so I would recommend it to my friends and the time it took to get was right on time and now I just put my headset on instead of having to hold the phone up to my ear so I can have more of the long conversations,positive
"I am in a job that requires me to be on the phone all the time.  I have been using this same exact brand of Plantronics headset for years.  It lasts about 1-2 years, but that seems about the norm with all the headsets I have had, or have heard about from others.  I like that there is a mute option on the wire and it is very comfortable.",positive
"I've had this product for about a year and half.  I've had no problems at all.  People can hear clearly on the other end, the Mute switch doesn't make any noise, volume control seems adequate.  It's been very durable too, I've dropped it on the floor a bunch of times and it has been unaffected.  Most importantly, the sound reproduction quality is excellent.  Other headsets I've used in the past have degraded the sound quality noticably.",positive
Made it to the junk tech drawer. Not worth the cost of return.  Not really the worth of completing the minimum word number for the review. Generally I don't pan a product but tested this on two phones. Keep looking.,negative
"My biggest problem is the SO keeps borrowing this when she takes conference calls at home.OK - second problem. Now I have a USB headset for skype/etc, and a wired headset for cell phones and when traveling (I usually don't bring the USB headset - too fragile). So now my nest of wires has gotten a little worse. Generally I don't like the quality/reliability of bluetooth, but I may try again in the next few months.",positive
I replaced 3 of these and then finally bought a DeCT 6 phone system and a dedicated all in one vs a cord like this. Cord and connection is a weak spot.,neutral
"Works fine, we have bought multiple models of Plantronics headsets and due to rough duty in my wife's purse, they all eventually fall apart. But while they survive they work great. Have tried ear buds, ear canal, blue tooth etc, but keep coming back to this style Plantronics for overall functionality.",positive
I purchased this headset for use when on the cell phone. The sound quality and way it fits is excellent. The headband could be a bit sturdier but I am careful when expanding or shortening it so I think it is fine.,positive
"This headset works great! I've been using it for several weeks now and the sound is clear and the fit is comfortable. I spend several hours a day on the phone, so comfort was a biggie for me.",positive
Convenient and easy to use - allows you to carry on a conversation and still listen in on conference calls.,positive
Very good headset. The first one was damage due to improper use. But this is a headset that we use everyday for work. 6 hours per day on average.Not perfect but very good and excellent range.,positive
"Bottom line, Plantronics makes the best headsets.  I've been very happy with this one.  People say they can hear me very clearly, and it's very comfortable to wear on long conference calls.  If it breaks in the future I'm sure I'll buy another Plantronics headset (this model or a comparable one).",positive
"I use a headset every day. The first one stopped working within a month, got it replaced (I have to pay for the return shipping) and the second one stopped working in a week (still have to put a warranty claim in). Decided to spend a few extra dollars and purchased the Plantronics HW261N Binaural Headset with the Plantronics 18straight Cable - Quick Disconnect To 2.5 Mm Plug,",negative
Someone told me that Plantronics was cheap but I beg to disagree!  Yes; the price was quite reasonable but the quality sound is great.,positive
"I bought this for its durability, but the sound quality was pretty low/poor; volume was low too.",positive
Works exactly as advertised.  Great for conf calls at home to keep hands free.  Mute button works great.  Use it on my home cordless phone and my blackberry with no problems.,positive
Plantronics is always a dependable brand and the quality of sound both incoming and outgoing is just as I expected.,positive
"By trying to be all things to all people, this headset is a compromise.  If you just want something to wear over your head you'll find Plantronics M214C to be better, and half the price.  Get that instead.(Just to be clear, I do own both this and the M214C).",negative
"I got a Panasonic KX-TCA60 and this Plantronics M175C.  The Plantronics M175C is definitely better.  It is more comfortable, and the microphone is more sensitive and has better sound quality.Scott",positive
"I had been looking for a good headset to use with my cordless phone at home. I have tried many headsets and none worked well enough for the people on the other end of the call to hear me. With this headset I can hear everyone clearly and they can hear me clearly. The price was great as well, under $20.",positive
"I purchased this headset because my old Plantronics headset fell apart. I do like this headset but I have been told that people can sometimes barely hear me when I am talking, so I have to move the mouth piece a little closer which sometimes causes my ear piece to move away from my ear.  Overall I am please with this purchase.",positive
"Good sound quality. Good price. Convenient in-line mute, mic and earpiece volume controls.  Versatile.  Will get uncomfortable for all-day users. IMO better than similar Panasonic (with the silly foam covered boom mic).",positive
These have great sound and my voice is clear to other parties. The volume switch and mute slider work well and it has lasted for some time.,positive
"I have had no trouble at all with this headset.  By the way, I recently bought a Panasonic KX-TCA98 headset and it's almost exactly the same, but a few bucks cheaper.  The difference is that the Panasonic does not have a microphone gain adjustment switch.",positive
"Not many sources to buy floppies these days, got it to copy DOS software for old application on Virtual Machine.The labels included are of very low quality, won't stick, and got caught in the reader, had to be removed with a tweezer.Otherwise, it is what it is--3 1/2 floppies.",positive
"They work just fine, I forgot how slow and noisy these are! Packaged well and shipped fast, not really much more to say about them.",positive
"Good product.  The floppy disks worked fine as advertised.FYI, I bought an External USB floppy drive to write these disks in the modern PCs(mostly for reprogramming BIOS on old motherboards).",positive
"I bought a pair of headphones from another company for ... way more money.  I stumbled on these as I didn't want to leave such expensive headphones in my desk at work.  Turns out, I never should have bought the more expensive pair.  I'm sure there are better ones on the market, but for my ears these are more than enough.",positive
"Perhaps my ears have been sullied by 'augmented' headphones in the past, but these particularly 'phones feel flatter and more lifeless than any others.  I'm not talking about a lack of thumping bass... that's fine by me.  But rather... well, it's hard to describe.  No warmth.  No resonance.  Just sterile.I suppose this'd be fine or perhaps even desireable for studio monitor work, but when I'm trying to enjoy folk tunes, classic jazz, orchestral music... it's just disheartening.",neutral
head pad part  can be folded easily and save lots of room.and it came with extra adapter for big hole. so my daughter can use it for her digital piano and listening music from regular MP3 player,positive
The sound is good but the design has a flaw and that is  the connection between the line cord and the ear piece lose connectivity.,negative
"I love these things. Incredibly flat response, great for mixing live or in the studio. Great for listening to music on my mp3 player. Excellent build quality.",positive
quality is heard here. nice fit and doesn't smash my head.  I wear glasses and have a hard time finding headphones that don't hurt.  sound with great and drowns out back noise well.,positive
"Love these, Light weight, excellant high, mid and low ouput. good frequency response. No fatigue. Never realized quality of the Sony MDR-V6 until you buy them. Oh! these are refurbished a steal!! Look new, sound super!! Happy, Happy customer",positive
fantastic range and clarity for the money. able to remixed songs with great attention to sound range separation and placement,positive
"Great sound,very comfortable .I bought the headphones for a replacement  for my older Sony set.I bought the older Sony from EBAY,beware when doing this,it was a fake Sony.Bought at a good price but the overall quality compared to the Sony MDR-V6 was inferior.The fakes are hard to detect,there are web sites that go over ways to check.",positive
"Why buy more expensive headphones unless you're into some kind of job that requires better.  This head phones sound great and are very well constructed they will endure many, many years of musical pleasure.  Some reviewers talk about this being a little tight on their ears and that is true but thats when they are new, what i did with mine was bent them open a little bit on the sides of the headrest and that solved the problem.",positive
I'm no audiophile but these are noticeably awesome. Fantastic audio quality all around at a very fair price. Highly recommended.,positive
"I bought these cans after reading loads of review. I am not disappointed--these are the best headphones I've ever owned. They are great for everything from opera to electronic music. You'll hear every detail in the recording, including the noise that maybe there. The sound is present, flat (as in honest) and lively.",positive
These sound great once they break in. I can wear them for hours without fatigue and they're built like tanks compared to some others on the market.,positive
Nice sound without burning a hole in your pocket. I also have Yamaha pro 300. Both are good. Sound qualityof both is very close but each has its own distinct quality. I like the Yamaha one being lighter but it costs a lot more.I just switch between them.,positive
"Unbelievable headphones.although they may hurt on your head after 30-40 minutes, the sound quality makes them worth it .",positive
"I love these headphones.  They fell really good on your ears, they are made of that soft like material and the compression on your head is not bad at all.Oh the sound, yeah they rock!",positive
Great sound. Comfortable on head and ears. Ears do get warm after a 90 minute movie. I hope they last a long time.,positive
"These are the best headphones that I've ever owned. I am prone to headaches, I work in a loud environment, and I like high quality sound. These over-ear headphones block out a lot of noise, don't squeeze too tightly on my head, and have incredible sound quality. I am very happy!",positive
"Great sound quality, great value. Highly recommend them. I used to break headphones all the time (1 pair every 6 months), now these have lasted me at least a year.Great value. Just buy them.",positive
There's not much to say other than the sound is great and the headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Highly recommended.,positive
"As an armature to the hifi sound devices, I have no complain about it so far. It is an excellent product on every aspects in terms of comfortableness, construction quality, sound quality and etc.After retracted, the whole thing is bit of bulky. It is not a portable product for carrying around in your backpack. Also rigid and cheaper looking leather bag is not a match for this earphone. I'd rather to have a soft cloth bag for it.",positive
"another positive review for this, surprising it's relatively cheap compared to other budget headphones. nothing more to add than what's already said, this one is definately one to add to your collection, even if this is the only one in your collection",positive
"These headphones are great! They give what some people call a flat sound...just the way an acoustical instrument woud sound in a room without an echo. In other words no excentuated highs, basses or midrange. They are ruggedly constructed for professional use. They are also pretty comfortable with one slight drawback. The plastic padding around each phone fits so snugly around my ears that my ears eventualy get a little too warm.Buy them. You wont be sorry.",positive
I bought these headphones to use at home and at church.  I am involved in the multimedia ministry at my church and these really do a great job.  You won't be disappointed if you get them.,positive
"so sweet and sublime, there isn't anything here that shouldn't be.  great separation and pure, rich sound as it was intended.  awesome, flavored with old-school cool.  buy a pair and find out for yourself.  rock on.",positive
"I am not an expert on this but based on the quality of the output sound, I would definitely recommend these. I also have sennheisers at the same price and I felt Sony this was better than those head headphones. They are very comfortable on your head and you can wear them for hours without any problem. They look very good and come with a very nice leather pouch and nice packing.",positive
"I've bought two pairs of these now, only because one was a gift to my Dad.  They're the best sounding I've used for the budget (and budgets hundreds higher).  Just know the ear pad will start to fall apart after awhile, I think it was around two years for me.",positive
"These are, by far, the best headphones I've ever owned.  Sony got it right when they invented the MDR-V6's, and that's why they've stayed pretty much the same (even the packaging) for about 30 years.  I'd recommend them to anyone.",positive
"and terrific sound. You don't need to spend $200+ on the good doctor's  prescription :). These are a very wise, economical, and sound worthy choice.",positive
"Based on all the recommendations on Amazon and around the Internet, this was the best model at my target price. The product actually exceeded my expectations. The sound is superior and the headset is very comfortable. As expected, Sony has not had to update this model for years because you can't improve upon perfection at this price point.",positive
"I like this headset, sound quality was great!Note:Cord is long.. No I mean really Long...It has an adapter for the large audio jackThey are adjustable for sizeThe ear pads are nice and soft",positive
These have become the preferred headphones of choice for tracking. I wasn't expecting much when I picked up a pair of these on Black Friday for $40. I've had numerous people google these after using them to see where they can get them in town quicker. These are the real deal.,positive
"Good set of cans for mixing and hearing they sound as it was recorded. If you want something for recreational music listening, these might not be for you thought I don't see why these couldn't be used for that. These have a good rep for a reasonable priced headphone for audio mixers etc.",positive
"Bought for my daughter for her sound engineering class.  They are versatile (2 types of connection) for home and studio.  Great sound high and low frequency and buffer ambient sound pretty well.  Highly recommend. Not the best money can buy, but a good deal.",positive
GOOD value for the money. Very nice sound quality and comfortable to wear for long periods.,positive
"These are well made headphones and have excellent response in the mid to high end frequencies but come up just a little short in the deep bass response. I did try them with several different sources. I listen to pretty much everything  classic, counrty, folk, rock, you name it( not much on rap or techno ). Compared to my Harmon Kardon and Pioneer speakers  or even cheap Skull Candy earbuds these headphones just didn't cut it for bass.",neutral
"I bought 3 different sets of headphones and this is the set I ended up keeping.  These are comfy, sound great, and feel like they will stand up to my daily uses.  Did i mention they sound awesome?>",positive
"The quality of sound from these phones is fantastic. Easily set-up, wonderful sound.Thanks.",positive
"If you want better sound get the 50mm versions (MDR6506?).  Anyway, this is what we use in professional studios. Aint nothing expensive to buy.  How do you like that?This is what the record you are listening to was mastered with!",positive
"I'm listening to Linda Ronstadt singing, Someone to Watch Over Me, as I write this. The sound is clear. There is no overbearing bass, just enough, the high notes sparkle like NYE champagne, and, Linda's Voice is wonderful, fantastic. The headphones don't get in the way of the music.",positive
"After many headphones I found these and they sound WONDERFUL!! the frequency response of 5 Hz - 30 kHz!!!!!!Unless you are going to spend many hundreds more for studio monitor headphones, don't hesitate purchasing these!!If purchasing for a very discerning ear these sound as good or better than the Bose line that costs twice as much.Bottom line is -- THESE DO NOT SUCK!!!!!But months later,.... NOW IT HAS A BUZZ IN THE RIGHT EAR AND I AM F___ED!!",negative
have tried jvc and others but sony is THE BEST for home recording studio and other uses including watching shows,positive
"Bought these head phones for my wife. She uses them when she flies, they fold up nice and they have better sound quality  than the ones i have that are a lot more expensive. Next ones i buy will be the sony's",positive
"I've had these headphones for six months and have been very pleased with my investment.  I use them at work and they are very comfortable and the sound is of very high quality, much better than the earbuds I was using before.  The included carrying case is another bonus, as is the folding design which makes these headphones portable enough to take on a plane.",positive
I use this to listen to music on my mp3 player at work.  The sound is good but after about an hour my ears begin to hurt and I have to take it off.,neutral
best headphones on earth. i actually confused some of the sounds on the records i was listening to for real sounds in my room. xD the bass really comes out and its so rich and distinct. it really had made me fall deeper in love with music.,positive
it's like a classic headphone but can beat many modern day headphone in terms of sound reproduction and quality.definitely won't regret owning this,positive
"Extended frequency response for harmonics,  thus sound is crystal clear. Also bass response is excellent. Very comfortable on the head and ears. This phone does NOT eliminate ambient noise, nor is it designed to do so.",positive
"It sounds great. And over the last year, It has proven to be quite sturdy. Easy to store in the bag that it comes with. I highly recommend it.",positive
I was going to buy the professional alternative of these headphones so before I did I read some of the reviews and there wasn't much of a difference I believe the only difference was the 1/4 plug is gold plated and this one isn't but these headphones are worth every penny. I use it for video editing and they rock hard.,positive
"First of all, I was nearly dissuaded from purchasing these because of complaints about tightness. Anyone who says these are tight probably never wore real headphones before. Depending on how pampered your ears are you may need more padding but that's it. Sound quality is superior and the fact these fold up so nicely make them excellent if you travel. As long as Sony makes these I doubt I will buy another brand/model.",positive
Love these have done well and still have great sound and quality just as good as good if not better then the hip hop brands,positive
"Sony MDR series headphones been always one of the best, no wonder many professional studios are using it! I use mine to play guitar at late and don't bother the neighbors. Once in a while the ear pad has to be replaced [B001DFX2OC",positive
"An excellent product, the audio quality is commensurate with the cost. Its design is perfect and comfortable. I've used products like this headset PRO2 and for less money obtiee very similar performance.Excellent, I recommend it.",positive
"I wasn't looking to spend too much so I found these. The reviews were great and they're comparable to Beats and other high end sets. Only knock is that the coil isn't detachable and the bass isn't that great. But overall, after a month of use, it's the best one I've ever had.",positive
"Great buy!! I read previous recommendations and made up my mind to get this great headphones.  They are as described. Sounds crispy and I think it gets better as you use them.  Very good isolation, despite you can hear when somebody talks which is a good thing.  Frequency response is amazing and seem to be well built too. Excelent ratio quality-price.",positive
"Arrived reasonably quick.  This headphone is from the last generation (age-wise).  It has better quality than many current more expensive name-brand models by different manufacturers.  Good sound quality for the money.  However, I have a big head and feel the headphone clamming on my head overly tight just like several other reviewers have commented.  My son loves it and it doesn't bother him.  He is using it all the time.",positive
I use these every day at work. Comfortable. Great sound. Much better build and sound quality than any other pair I've owned. Tried to talk the kid into these instead of the silly Beats but couldn't do it. Sound quality is a distant second to looks apparently.Could only be better by allowing for easy cord removal. I almost never need a 3m coiled cord. I'll probably follow one of the excellent DIY cord replacements online.,positive
I use these headphones several times a week on my computer to listen to music.  Fantastic sound quality.  One of the best audio purchases I've ever made and I have three surround systems in my home.  Very pleased indeed.  Would buy again !!,positive
Thank you Sony. This is a very good headphone. Comfortable on the ears and not so heavy to bring around.,positive
"Can't go wrong with these headphones, the price is right and the sound is very good. I'm no audiophile, and these aren't audiophile priced headphones, but they work great for gaming and music sounds crisp and clear. I would say give these a try if you are looking for reasonably priced headphones that sound good.",positive
"Buy them. Light, comfortable and great sound. I will say that I was disappointed at first. Initially they are too (painfully) bright, but after about 30 hours I was really impressed.",positive
"I can't say enough nice things about these headphones.  You will not be disappointed.  I've had a pair for nearly 10 years and they are still killing it.  Buy a pair now, or spend three times as much for essentially the same headphone.",positive
"Pro:Great sound.  Fairly effective sound isolation.  Well built.Cons:i don't find these headphones to be super comfortable for extended wear.1) They are tight on my head2) My ears are bigger than the hole, so they kind of pinch.It might be that after a while they'll stretch out or relax to my head.... and they will become more comfortable.",neutral
"I love these headphones. The sound is superb. Bass, Treble, etc... It's all super good. In the airplane they are just about noise canceling. The only beef I have with these is they are a little loose on the head. I'll take it though. I have used them with a Droid Phone, and I don't think they are quite loud enough sometimes. However, that is just the phones issue I bet.",positive
There has been a degeneration of Sony products.  These headphones are cheaply made (wiring is not concealed) and are not as comfortable and well made as my Sony MDR-V600 headphones that are more than 12 years old. Fortunately Sony still sells replacement earphone covers for the good headphones that it formerly made.,neutral
"Bought for my Nephew as I have a pair that was purchased in 1989 and after replacing the pads are still wonderful.He really likes them and I rarely see him without them now! (He's 15)He's using them with his iPhone, iPad, and notebook.Hopefully he'll get 35+ years out of them.",positive
"Purchased this set for my father who has difficulty hearing.  He likes to listen to music on an MP3 player while mowing the lawn.  These work well, he says that they sound great and block out a lot of background noise.  He is very please with them.",positive
Audio is crisp and clear and design is very comfortable. Even more comfortable when paired with the Beyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour Padded Earcushions.,positive
"For the price, you can't beat these. I'm an audio nut. These headphones are balanced. Very versatile. Great quality and comfortable fit. Can't see a headphone beating these out (for the price). They sound like $300+ headphones.",positive
I've owned two pair of these headphones over the years.  This pair was a gift for my grandson.  There was a problem with them when I received them.  The insulation on the cable was pulling away at the earphones.  I returned them and Amazon immediately replaced them.  If I ever need another pair this is what I'll buy again.,positive
I bought these as a gift because I had bought these very same headphones for myself years ago.  I love them.,positive
Maybe nit Senhiesers but they are very good phone for the $.  This is the second pair I have owned in 25 years.  The first were destroyed by a new puppy in the house.  NOT DOG PROOF!,positive
Beautiful sound.  Very clear highs and solid bass.  I also have Sony noise-cancelling phones.  I love Sony products.  Very dependable quality.,positive
"I produce digitally composed music. These are an absolute for anyone that makes computer music, just go ahead and add these quality, comfortable, crisp sounding headphones to your studio.No need to look around at other brands or cheaper/more expensive ones, these are the headphones you are looking for. Trust me.Check out my old tunes at  . Bunch of new songs droppin' in January. My soundcloud will improve now that I have these headphones.",positive
"Didn't buy these on amazon, but had to come and pay my respects. I noticed after buying these that a lot of radio programs would use these headphones.",positive
"I have a collection of headphones, but now by far this is my favorite, very comfortable in long use. Highly recommended. On the go they are lightly and when not in use, they fit in the pocket of my regular jacket. I love them, the sound is crystal clear. And for that price nobody can beat them.",positive
"Love them, sound fantastic, easy to ware.  I'm a programmer and I ware them for about 6 hours a day every workday while listing to music.-James",positive
"I've had these headphones on at a reasonable volume, and I cannot hear people directly in front of me talking to me.  The sound quality is excellent.  I want an extra pair because my husband keeps stealing mine.",positive
"These headphones are great, when buying these headphones don't expect major hardcore bass because that is not what they are meant for, they are evened out and have a very clear pleasant sound balancing all of the sounds in music, videos, etc.",positive
"A relative bargain when compared to &#34;fashion lifestyle&#34; headphones.  The Sony 'phones were always known for being quite good and these out perform many costlier headphones.  The ear pads will fall apart after a year or two, so expect to have to replace them.  This happens to most headphones with this type of ear pad.  This isn't unique to Sony.",positive
"I'm very happy with this headphones, however I can't take them to my office. I just enjoy them in my bed and feel in a concert. Great seller, beautiful sony package.",positive
"Fit perfectly on my head - I'm 5'1&#34;, so some headphones are rather loose because the headband is too big.Great noise cancelation without giving me a headache.Great clear sound",positive
"Possibly the best headphone I have ever bought. The build quality is great, One complain the ear cushion can ware off easily but I third party replacements are available.",positive
"Not only are these headphones great to listen to,they fit nice and snug. Great sounding phones like these are hard to find at a good price. They are very comfortable and they filter out noise around you. The sound is clear and accurate. I heard sound from my music I never heard before.Thats why I give the Sony MDR-V6, A Best Buy 5 star rating.",positive
"These headphones are great, but I could have saved $90 if I just kept using my, Panasonic RP-HTF600-S Stereo Headphones, instead of looking for ""a better"" pair of headphones to buy.  Also, these Sony headphones have the heavy coil wire which gets to be a little uncomfortable. The heavy coil wire makes it feel more tense as if the headphones are being pulled off your ears.",positive
"I love these headphones. It gives me a nice clear, crisp sound when listening to music and videos. My boyfriend didn't know what the difference was between good headphones and quality headphones until I let him borrow these. Now he won't give them back to me :( I always go with Samsung and LG for anything visual and Sony for all things audio.",positive
I tried these out before burning them in and a 40-hour burn in was enough for me to notice a difference in the overall responsiveness.  I use these to double-check my mixes and to help balance out my recordings in addition to regular studio monitors.  They also work well in a slightly noisy environment when you need to monitor something.,positive
This is simply put the best headphone that I've ever own.  I've never heard anything that sound remotely as good as this headphone.  I'm hearing subtle sounds and beat from my music that I never heard before.  And the price couldn't be better and the cool packaging was a nice topping.  My only regret is not knowing about this class of headphone sooner.,positive
"The Sony MDR-V6 produces superb sound across the entire spectrum.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I do not find the lows stronger or weaker than the mid-range and highs.  The set is comfortable, and the cups insulates noises well (not to compare to noise-canceling headphones).  All that said, I still feel that the set should cost at $15-$20 less.",positive
"I have a small recording studio and bought these for mixing phones after reading some reviews.  These have a great clear sound, not too bottom heavy like some headphones can be....they can hurt alittle after you wear them for awhile but over all these are really great headphones for everything from mixing to just listening to your favorite tunes.",positive
i wear my sony mdr v-6 headphones at work in an office. usually they get about 4-5 hours of use a day. i must include the fact that i wear eye glasses.  i am totally satisfied with these.  they sound great and the comfort level is 10/10 even with glasses.  my head is a size 7 1/4 around and my ears are about normal size. RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
I agree with other reviewers about the sound quality and build quality etc. Excellent product on its own.But this is not for someone who loves bass like me. I ended up buying another extra bass SONY XB700 which is much more bassy.,positive
I am very happy with these headphones. For under 50 bucks you get sound quality equal to the bargain sets around twice the price.,positive
Very rich sound for the price.  Have owned this product for several years and the sound is spot on but the earpads flaked badly and fall off repeatedly which is a pain in the ass to deal with.  See many similar complaints.,neutral
These headphones sound amazingly good and are even better considering I got them for around $70 (Refurbished).They fit very well in my head and I can use them for hours. They also fold and come with a pretty nice carrying bag.Would definitely purchase again!,positive
Its a decent headphone for the priceAmazing soundFor indoor use is perfect but for outdoor like using with iPod not to good the cable is to long and curly,positive
I really enjoy having bass back in my music. These MDR-v6's are excellent quality and also work well when used with my iPad.,positive
After close to 20 years I broke down and got my second pair of my MDR's  my first two MDR-600 witch I have are the best headsets you can buy.  The MDR-V6 is the same just a bit smaller and lighter  for the price I am absolutely blown away $40 they should be well over $100 and I paid more than that two decades ago for my old set.  You cant go wrong.,positive
"Other reviews are good.  I like these because they are supposedly flat.  I like my games and sound cards to do the adjusting of the sounds.  Good for music and games.  Interesting note, when my Dad did research and picked a pair of these in the 80's, he picked these also.",positive
"Piece of crap, the ear pads keep coming off.  I should have just bought the Beats headphones by dr. dre instead.",negative
"These are the best headphones in this price range by far. The Bass is great (Listen to a lot of hip-hop and house), The quiet strings (Listen to Classical), and Everything in between, honestly best for that price, Last you 15 or more years, if you take care of them of courseSony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil",positive
"OK I have had this unit for a few months...At first I thought it was a revelation.The most realistic flat and detailed unit ever herd.Then I realized that the mids are slightly recessed ANdThe highs were fatiguing after extendid listening.So as revealing as these units are, they are not the end of your journey on headphones.I myself still have them but end up using the audiotechnica es7 as the es7 is just the best",positive
"I purchased these to listen to my mp3 collection on my tablet, and they sound amazing...are comfortable, and ooze with quality, hey it's a Sony...",positive
"I spent a long time researching headphones. I truely appreciate quality sound, but I'm cheap so I didn't want to spend a lot. Well, for under $100 these headphones couldn't be any better. Absolute clarity with incredible richness and punch. I love these headphones!!!",positive
"Great headphones.....they work well with Ipod, computers, stereos...basically everything.....amazing sound....quite comfortable although sometimes a bit hot....highly recommend these....only downside is that they aren't nearly as Stylish as many other closed headphones out there, and no noise reduction.Mike, Toronto, Ontario",positive
"I've gone through a lot of different headphones, all I've loved for different reason but in the end I decided to stick with these. They don't do anything bad in my opinion. Also I'd recommend you buy the velvet ear pad's for them.",positive
"Pros:Great sound Clear, crisp, and bass is perfect not over saturated to the point where you cant hear the music.Cheap for its qualityBuild is solid and not very plasticy like othersNot tight on the head nor does it fall off from being too looseCons:I have encountered none",positive
"Of course you can spend a ton of money on amps, DACs, and headphones. This pair of headphones will deliver 90% of the quality of super high end gear at about 10% of the cost.I also own the ATH M50 and I'd recommend the Sony MDR-V6 (unless you're into more bass heavy things). The Sony's are also more comfortable. They don't feel as sturdy, but they're very well built too.Unconditional recommendation.",positive
"I paid upper 70s on sale a couple of months ago. I think it's 10 to 15 less now.  They're worth $70 so if they've dropped in price then they're definitely worth it. Sound is good for digital stereo, but won't compare to a surround sound headphone. If all you need is stereo you won't be disappointed.",neutral
If you ask my hubby I know he would say this is the best gift I ever gave him.  He drives a truck and when he is getting loaded or unloaded he spends alot of time on the docks.  These headphones take out a done of the back round noises so he can listed to his MP3 player or do work on the laptop!,positive
"My son really loves these headphones. The really cut out external sounds well and sound very full. For the cost, it is really hard to find this kind of quality in sound.",positive
These are so good I bought another pair. my little bastard cat ate one of the little wires that hang and it broke one of the ears but since sony makes such good stuff I was able to fix it with a little razor and some black tape. I use these to keep my girlfriend from hearing when I write songs about how much I want to kill that cat.,positive
These sound great.  One star removed because a) it's easy to knock the cushion off the earpiece and very difficult to get it back on and b) the curly cord is a pain - it gets knotted up on itself easily and is generally in the way.  A straight cord would be better.,positive
Can't complain. These have good sound at a very reasonable price. They do lack a bit in bass for my taste but I am a bit of a bass head so this was somewhat expected. I did almost have to max out the volume on my mp3 player with these headphones so perhaps they would benefit from an amplifier. All in all a good buy.,positive
Best headphones i ever bought! Fits on my head perfect no need to press down on it to feel the bass! Works well with trance music! Alots of bass!,positive
Not as much bass as i thought. But it's not supposed to i guess. Just for the studio to get true sound. I need bass headphones though.,positive
"I love the sound stage of this headphones, I have been using them more and more everyday. Besides the Shure SRH440 are superior (imho) for Jazz / Classical, the sony's are amazing for those mixed playlist.",positive
"Bought these headphones 6 years ago. Had to replace the ear pads, but they still sound great! I would buy them again if and when I have a need for a new set of headphones.",positive
Once upon a time I thought Apple's earphones were the best. LOL. I felt like God when I first used MDR-V6 cans. It's like upgrading a game character from level 1 to 100 in an instant.,positive
These are really good headphones. There is a lot of great reviews on these so I'm not going to bother going into that. I would be very surprised to hear someone did not like the sound of these. I would highly recommend. A+,positive
"If you love the MDR-7506s, you will love the V6s.  I was hesitant to switch but after many promising years with my 7506s, I did not feel alienated with the V6 headphones.  If I had $350 to spend on headphones, I would still get these any day of the week.  Rich bass, excellent vocals, and pristine clear sound overall.  Anyone who works radio, podcasts, or records music will want these.",positive
The sound is decent and the built quality is great. I certainly think these will last me few years. These however do hurt the first time i wear them but i'm sure it will become better in the future.,positive
I am casual listener and looking for headphone which satisfy my need for music and this is where my search has ended.,positive
I priced many headphones  and this one was the biggest bang for the buck; I can't see how spending more on headphones would make a difference.,positive
"I can't believe I got by for years without owning these, as a music lover.I got chills right away the first time I cranked up some favorite tunes with these new (old) cans. (Well, new to me.)The frequency response is supposedly 5-30K Hz. At this price point, you'd be hard pressed to find better, I should think.Good seal over the ears without being uncomfortable after a while. GREAT sound.Short and sweet, well worth the cost.",positive
"This headphone is especially good for rock, less so for classical.  It sounds best if driven from a low impedance amplifier. In that case, it goes very low, and has some slam in the bass.  Otherwise it lacks the slam and doesn't go as low. Rock vocals cut through with authority (try the Stones for a good experience!), as does electric guitar.  I haven't tried them with current pop, but my wife has, and she loves them.",positive
"Comfortable, and sound great.No complaints whatsoever.  They feel well made, sturdy, and durable.Great for turning the music up to 11, while still being a good neighbor.Would certainly purchase again.",positive
"I love it when someone writes a really good review and I look forward to receiving the item. If you want to be in your own world and hear music in a whole new way, get these! You will be so glad you did!",positive
These are very high quality headphones for about 1/3 the cost of the high end ones.I'm using them right now at 5 AM while my wife sleeps in the next room.The sound quality is a great surprise. Made well and fit great.The best head phones I've ever owned. I read a lot of reviews before I bought these.I'm very glad that I did.,positive
My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.,positive
"I love these. They accompany my Sansa Clip+ perfectly. After burning them in for 40hours and RockBoxing my clip, I could not be happier with my $115.00 total portable audio solution(Sansa Clip+ MDR-V6. These sound great with iPods as well! Bass, mids and highs are great for musical scores, hip hop, electronica, big band jazz, and classical. Great buy!",positive
These headphones have a very nice sound and are very comfortable.  I use them while playing my electronic piano and they seem to deliver a true and full sound. They collapse into a fairly small size and have a nice storage pouch. The cord is a bit short but otherwise they're great.,positive
"Everyone's hearing is different so this is not really a critical review.I guess you really have to try headphones first, much like speakers.This is one disadvantage with mail-order products but Amazon is great with returns.",neutral
"These headphones have great sound reproduction. I also have a medium to large head, and they are comfortable. i have not had any issues with the stock pads making my ears sore. They also cup the ears nicely so they cut out a good amount of outside noise. These are totally worth the $75 or so I paid for them. The sound is comparable to headphones double the price.",positive
I like these a lot and I decided to go with a wired setup for my night time home theater watching. It sucks some times having a wire but sound quality is good and I was able to get two of these for a good bit cheaper than the one set of wireless ones I was looking at.,positive
"Awesome sound, super clear and crisp.  But also...somehow...not enough bass for me.  Somehow *too* accurate for me, I want more somehow.",neutral
PROS:1. excellent sound reproduction2. price3. durability (my original pair has survived 5 international trips and almost everyday usage for over a year now)4. comfortable5. long cordJust brought another one to be kept at workplace.,positive
"If you're looking for a comfortable headset with superior sound without having to spend an arm and leg, this is it.  I especially like the comfortable fit, allowing my my ears to fit snugly inside.  Comes with a nice storage bag too.",positive
I bought this one during BlackFriday 2012 to be used together with my iPhone 5. I am not a professional in headphones but this one meets all my basic needs in daily use at the appropriate price!,positive
"this headphones are amazing, the sound is really good and the quality of the product is excellent, this headphones are really comfortable, and it didn't weight too much.",positive
Use these in my studio and they work great!  Can pump a lot of volume through these without them distorting.,positive
"These are great headphones!I work in the music industry and for the price point, I would rather buy these versus any of the higher price Sony MDR models.",positive
Really love the sound quality and comfort of the headphones.  They fit well and feel comfortable even hours after putting them on.,positive
"sony's earphone headphone are usually heavily tuned, or heavily colored. but this is not the case for mdr V-6. after 5 years of use, it still remain one of the best ear phones i ever had.however. the ear cushions can easily be worn out (maybe because i have eye glasses?) I can't find a replacement. any ideas?",positive
"I knew I was getting something neat just by looking at the brand and all the possitive reviews. These headphones rule, they feel very durable and the sound is just great.",positive
These are time tested phones that I feel shine in the rock genre. A healthy bass and clear highs bring out the bottom without clouding the top.,positive
"Pros -The audio is good once you burn it for 50+ hrs, the build looks solid that will last yearsCons -Heavy and uncomfortable. It presses hard on ears so you can't listen to for long time!I returned to to get more comfortable ones even though I got these ones at very good price 49$ from Amazon",positive
"I'm no audiophile, but I have been an amateur musician for the last 30 years. These headphones are an excellent choice for the price. Comfortable fit, brilliant highs, booming lows and middy mids - also very good ambient noise blocking. Even with no input I have to take them off to have a conversation. Overall - just another really great product from Sony. You can get much better cans than these, but not at this price.",positive
"The quality is what you would expect of Sony, consistent and well made. I also am a Bose enthusiast, but I was impressed with all the specs on the Sony Digital headset, so I thought I would give them a try.  I was not let down, they fit good, comfort is good and the sound quality is very good.",positive
"I have a set of Sennheiser 590 headphones and I must say these do have more detail and clarity. They are very comfortable to wear. I highly recommend them. They are also very efficient (doesn't take a lot of power to drive them). I bought the Beyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour ear cushions to put on them, and did they make a difference. Very comfortable.",positive
I got these about a year or so ago. They sound good and are comfortable but after a year the covers on the ear piece are falling apart and are not cheap to replace.,neutral
Got these for my teen who is a budding musician. He says &#34; These headphones have okay mids and amazing lows. They can hurt your ears after a few hours of use from squeezing but its not that bad. I use them for music production and music listening&#34;.He would recommend them.,positive
"After window shopping at a bunch of stores and testing countless headphones, I decided to settle on this particular set for the sound quality. The sound is amazing and definitely worth the money. I only wish I could've gotten a little bit more bass out of it, but I can complain too much due to the other aspects of this headphone.",positive
"I had the MDR-V6s in the early 1990s...loved them but for some dumb reason replaced them with MDR-V600s. I was never happy with the V600s and now 20 years later just replaced them with the MDR-V6. Right out of the box...instant clarity, deep accurate bass, an articulate musical sound. Not sure what the V6 has that makes it so good.",positive
"I was looking for headphone with high fidelity, and surprise... I Got it at a reasonable price, Its the best I ever  buy",positive
I already own a pair of these Sony MDRV6 Series Headphones & enjoy them very much.  I bought these as a second pair since Sony discontinued them. These replacement  Headphones sound exactly as my other Sony MDRV6 Headphones. Hope these last me as long as my other pair which are now ten years old.  These Headphones offered by Amazon are worth the price I paid!!!,positive
I had two pairs of these headphones that both broke in a few months. I don't get why the cord looks so very heavy-duty when the part you work with the most is so brittle.,neutral
"A little on the large side, but the sound is very good.  A great value for the price.  I am glad I got these.  Sure beats little ear buds in sound quality.",positive
"I bought a set of these to replace an old set of MDR-V600 I had that were falling apart. These are great phones for the price!  Very light, good reproductions, comfortable to wear.  The headband padding is not quite so thickly padded as the V600 but good enough.  I'm sure there are audiophiles who can rip on their response in this or that frequency, but for my money these are the BEST in their price range.",positive
"Paid $67 on Amazon.  Bought these for my Dad for Christmas, along with an mp3 player.  Very good sound quality.  Picked up some aftermarket earpads based on previous reviews and are very comfortable.  Definetly recommended.",positive
"I've enjoyed using this model of Sony headphones for more years than I can count. My older set has been restored with fresh ear pads, and this newer set shares the same excellent sound quality, comfort, and workmanship. Highly recommended.",positive
Super high quality sound and for the price they can not be beaten.  My friends all agreed these were the best headphones they have ever listened to.,positive
I got the MDR-V6 as a gift and have had it for half a year.The sound quality is best of all headphones I've used.It's a bit uncomfortable because I wear prescription glasses. I have to take it off and relief my head after half hour's listening. But it's just a minor inconvenience.People who don't have eye glasses should have no issue at all.,positive
"I have had a pair of these headphones for about 20 years. I have just bought another pair of these.  Before I bought my second pair, I tried Bose and Sennheiser headphones.  Some of them cost more than $300 per pair, but nothing beats these old Sony headphones in sound quality.",positive
"This is probably the best money I have ever spent on. I originally bought a pair of V6 at Best Buy ten years ago. YES, ten years later they are still functioning well except the ear pad falling off and I replaced the ear pad. It sounds still amazing compare to a lot of phones I got in recent years - Bose, even compare to B&W.... This is definitely worth the SONY brand. Highly recommended!",positive
"excellent sound, of course these lack the base that we have in the new headphone we have now but i'll still pick these over a beat or bose.the only thing i don't like is the long very long wire which make them more for home use headphone.",positive
"These headphones lasted 2 years total.  The included muffs only lasted 1 year before they started slipping off very often and flaking.  I bought a replacement for $20 and I thought I would be good.  All of a sudden the left speaker stopped working, 2 years after the purchase date.  I'm not wasting my time with any more sony trash.  Save yourself some time and go with a better brand.",negative
"Nice picture quality and easy to use.  This unit doesn't include the external power supply, so I would buy one or a card reader for downloading the photos to your PC - or if you are buying a photo printer, too, the HP  models (1000, 1100) have a built in card reader.  Downloading drains the  batteries quickly.  I like the color LCD for reviewing your pictures and  the megapixel resolution produces nice, photo quality shots with good  detail.",positive
"Mine was manufactured in March 1996, and according to the original owner was used pretty much daily. I have this beauty now, and with an HDTV Converter connected via the available composite inputs, this set still outperforms modern HDTVs on every picture criteria other than raw resolution. My friends cannot believe the superb quality of the Trinitron image after all these years. Think a new flat panel TV will still be going after 13 years of hard use?",positive
"This is one of the best 9"" TVs I have ever seen. Sony's 9inch TV sets are incredibly sharp. The reason is the 9"" Trinitron picture tube, its Dynamic Picture Processor and Automatic White Balance. The picture is colorfully crisp and sharp. It makes VHS tapes and DVDs look crystal clear and pinpoint precision sharp.",positive
"I owned the prior model, which was a pretty good set but had some nagging flaws (buttons often broke, pushing the wrong button reset the picture to 'baseline', which was awful). This set has flush buttons that are water resistant, the picture is good every time, and even the automatic (when muted) closed-captioning is useful. The FM tuner is gone, but it wasn't that good anyway.",positive
"It's not sturdy at all. However, it does the job that I need it for. I would have purchased something stronger that didn't feel as if it would break if I dropped it or used it frequently. Flimsy.",negative
"Cassette tapes are on a comeback, so get yourself this awesome tape player and don't forget to buy some hammer pants and grow a mullet.  They don't get any better than this, complete with mic/phone jacks, ac/dc power, built in speaker and mic, and a mechanical counter!!!  Wow!!!!Respect the books on tape!",positive
"With the purchase of a new car, I found that I had no way of playing my favorate cassette tapes.  This works great and I use it in the house as well as on the road.",positive
"I made the mistake of buying a slightly cheaper GE recorder, with horrible sound.The Sony is only a few dollars more and immensely better.  Very good sound reproduction, even using only the internal mic.Automatic shutoff and a carrying handle are extra features which other low-price units don't have.",positive
"I bought this for my wife use at school.  She is a teacher and has a lot of cassette teaching tapes.  She asked to research for safe and good quality device.  Using this Sony TCM-929 at school makes her happy.  The device has nice new-days design to play old cassette tapes.  It is simple, stable, and safe.",positive
works as spec'd. it does what it said it would do. what more can I say. that's my whole review.,positive
"I agree with all the other reviews of this item. Exactly right for the price. I use it primarily to listed to books on tape that can't be gotten on CD, and it does the job perfectly.",positive
Since getting rid of my rarely used tape deck I needed to have something that I could use to occasionally play cassette tapes. This fits the bill perfectly.,positive
For $10 ..what a deal.I write songs and play guitar and it's handy to record the music (at the moment).Sound  quality as expected is mediochre.I did  record a financial message from my speaker phone (Panasonic) handset. Very good. This alone justifies this recorder. I will have to record from this to a digital hand recorder to check out the quality.Digital is not everything...but almost. lol,positive
"this device does what it was intended to do, record and play. it has performed adequately as expected. i haven't gone wrong with any sony product, yet.",positive
I have been using this almost daily and love it.  I use rechargeable batteries and get many hours of play out of each charge.  I love it because it is portable and I can easily take my audio book with me.  Prompt shipping as always.,positive
Was exactly what was needed to get an older version of a Sony camera to work for my daughters camera. Memory was what was advertised and great price. Thanks.,positive
I had to  return this one as it was the wrong size for my camera. Im sure its a good product though as I got one just like it of the right size.,positive
you sent me the wrong item.  the item you sent me was suppose to go to MR. FELIZ  BIRDI.  WROONG ITEM/i really don't know what your going to do.,negative
The 4 stars is arbitrary.  This is no top end table such as Rega.  But for the price it is decent and I have found the speed to be steady.  Most of my music playing is CD's.  I pretty much only buy vinyl music not available on CD.  If you are an audiophile who plays a lot of vinyl this is not the table for you.,positive
Title says it all. These are very low quality cables and the female end is a joke. Look for ones that actually cover the male end you plug in and not this cheesy aluminum end like this one has.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MT1EQM/ref=oh_o04_s00_i00_detailsthis is the cable I went to and it rocked. Worked perfect for reasonable price.  You'll be glad you read this post.  God Bless,negative
I bought this product to extend my web camera and it works great. The product is as described and the price was right. Easy to use. I will buy again and recommend this to everyone.,positive
"I'm not a big fan of the exposed connector on the female end, but I can't complain much on a &#60; $5 cable that feels pretty durable.",positive
It is exactly as described. It works good & have not had any troubles with it.,positive
"I purchased this extension cable to allow me to sit on my couch and still use my gaming headset on my PS3. It works prefect for that, I have had no problems with it and do not foresee any either.",positive
I recently bought a cheap dollar tree usb and I kept gettingUsb device unrecognized message in windows.No problems with this wire. Very fast and good length.This wire is plugged into a hub which is also connected with same usb wire.No problems one month later.,positive
This is a simple extension cable that works great for things like extending a keyboard or mouse.  I used it for that purpose and had no trouble.  If you need a longer extension you'll need and active version.,positive
"Needed a US Extension Cable so I could extend my Iphone charger. (The outlet is on the floor) Now I can plug one end of this cable into the charger/outlet and leave it there, then loop the cable behind and onto my desk and plug in my charger! Now my charger could reach my phone/desk. Works perfect to extend any USB Charger! Only gripe is the price. Wish it was a tad cheaper, hence the 4 stars.",positive
I almost bought it but checked the speed right before I hit the purchase button.The 12 mbit speed means it is USB 1.1.  That is about 5% of the speed of USB 2.0.It will not work in many applications. You can get a good USB 2.0 cable for the same price.,negative
"Good quality cable, feels durable, works as described. Well made. Good buy. The price is also acceptable as well. Not quite sure if it is USB 1.0 or 2.0. Will check when I get back.",positive
"Sometimes USB chords are just too short. This chord has given me room to p;lay with. It seems to be sturdy, and reliable. I would recommend it.",positive
"I apparently already had one and purchased another a few days ago.  Although the box states 12 Mbps on the front, on the back of the package it lists that it has been tested with high speed devices.  Also, on Belkin's website, it also states the cable is 2.0  A quick call to Belkin confirmed that it is 2.0 compatible.",positive
"Extension for gaming console duty. Replacing a worn out extension cable, these seem to only last about a year or so before they get flaky. Rated one star short because the female end is not overmolded (could have sworn the image showed that when I made the selection?!?). Still a good deal and its a brand name cable. Will probably buy more in a year or so",positive
"This same cable sells for over $20.00 at local electronics stores.  Not only was this an incredible buy, but customer contact was professional and consistent.  I will certainly purchase here again - look out Fort Worth!",positive
"I needed a new USB extension cable and all of the local options, such as Walmart were about $20.  After searching on line I found the Belkin cables through Amazon a very good price so I purchased 4 of them so that I would have some on hand for the future.  Basically I got 4 cables for about the price of one purchased locally.",positive
I needed an extension cable so I could use a USB controller with my PC.  The whole idea was so I could play emulated video games from my couch rather than from my chair (my computer is already connected to my television).  This cable performs exactly like I need it to with no problems.,positive
Needed an extension cord to be able to more widely use my webcam(it came with an unbelievably short cord).  I can now take my webcam around almost my entire room without issues at all.,positive
"Received item as advertied.  It works very well as an extension cable should.  Also received the item very promptly, thanks!",positive
"The USB extension cable works great.  I purchased four of these for my Xbox 360 and Rock Band and Guitar Hero games (I prefer the wired setup to the wireless).  The cables work just as you would expect.  No surprises here, but any surprise would mean bad things.",positive
"Yes, it is 6 feet long, and works.  It extends a USB device cable so that it can reach your computer or USB hub.  Not much else this thing can do.  I like the gray!",positive
This cord is great. Works well and is plenty long enough to suit my needs. No problems with this item.,positive
This product was shipped very quickly and received in excellent condition.  It was perfect for my purpose of connecting my PC to my TV. I highly recommend this product.,positive
USB Cable was dead on arrival. Not cool considering I ran it through a wall.Today's lesson: Test your cords before running them.,negative
My Flip Video Ultra Series Camcorder wouldn't connect using this cable.  I purchased a Flip Video Ultra Series Camcorder along with this Belkin F3U134-10 USB Extension Cable.  My computer (Dell running XP Pro) wouldn't recognize the USB device (Flip Ultra) using this cable.  The Flip connected immediately when plugged directly into the USB port.Belkin is a reputable supplier but this cable got just 1 star for my application.,negative
"Nothing outstanding about this that separates it from any generic cable you can buy - I was just in a hurry to get something, and this was at the top of the list.",neutral
I have bought multiple of these. They are great to extend a phone charger. I have them on all of my chargers. They have aged well also!,positive
Works great. I've been able to extend my gaming laptop to a custom setup over my zero gravity chair. Now I can get up and move to my desk without interuption.,positive
"When you shop for cables and other electronic adapters, all you want is for them to do what you need them to do.These cables and adapters do just that. No problems, no hassles.",positive
Product worked well for my needs. The price I paid was very good compared to a retail store. Shipping was on time. Packaged very well. Good by for the money.,neutral
"Unfortunately, this cable is too long to carry a power charge sufficient for a usb-powered external hard drive or to use as an extension to a car charger for a phone or iPod.  It also will not be compatible with a powered usb hub either - I haven't tried it with an unpowered one.However, it's useful for peripherals such as mice and keyboards at least.",positive
"Nothing fancy here. I ordered two of these 10 foot usb extenders and they do exactly that, extend my usb devices. Awesome.",positive
nothing like being able to extend a short apple cable and not lose any data transfer  Highly suggest you pick one or two up,positive
used this to extend usb from keyboard to computer - works well - no problems - only need 2 more words,positive
This product works very well. I am presently using it with my keyboard.  I have no problems with it.  I highly recommend this product.,positive
Nothing amazing to say here but the product works exactly how you would want it to.  Belkin is always a good brand so you can't go wrong especially at this price. :),positive

no honestly it works fine. not much more to say other than its a long cord..lol. so you can move to another room if you want..lol,positive
"I've used this for years now and it's never stopped working. Both ends are high-quality, as is the wire in between.",positive
I am using it to increase the length of some short usb cables. For instance iPhone 4 has too short cable to charge from wall outlet. I want my phone to lie on my table while it is charging. And this extension cable helps me with that!,positive
"Not much to say. It is a USB extension cord. I have had it for a while and used it for a few different devices and it has worked great on all of them, from an iPhone plugged into the wall to allowing me to relocate my printer to a more convenient area.It is pretty solidly built as well, with thick rubber housings on the connections and a thick cable sleeve.",positive
"This cable works.  Period.  Haven't had it long, but big surprise . . . chances are, whatever you pay on amazon will be a lot less than your local retailer.",positive
"Great price and good quality, Belkin is always dependable.  The length is perfect for some temporary work areas and I have used it many times.",positive
Okay it works fine.,positive
I purchased this to extend a USB cable in order to plug the cable into a wall charger instead of the PC.  Very sturdy well-made cable.,positive
Not much to say. It's a USB extension cord. Plugs fit perfectly. Will update this review if the cord ever fails.,positive
Does the job is a good value for the money I would recommend it to anyone needing one better than the stores.,positive
"I am usually very ""details aware"" but I also did not realize that this was old-school USB 1 and NOT USB 2 capable.",negative
"I bought this to extend a printer cable. I always buy Belkin because of superior quality. This cable extension works perfectly. I am very pleased, and at such a great low price.",positive
I like mine it gives me just a little extra cord for my key board.,positive
Really great cable if you need to use a USB device that is a distance away from the PC.  I was using this for a USB Cell Modem and it worked flawlessly.  We are now using this cable for attaching other devices and it is working great.,positive
"It is a USB &#34;extender,&#34; meaning it will &#34;extend&#34; your current USB cable (like an extension cord for USB cables.)  In that respect, it performs very well.  No problems to report, does what I need it to do.",positive
works great,positive
"I needed this extension cable to extend a USB computer keyboard cable. The cable works great, no problems. Belkin is a well know name for quality cabling.",positive
"If it works, I love it. This works.This 10' cable extends a normal cable. Looks good.  Works fine.Belkin makes some really good cables.  I've always used them and never been disappointed.",positive
"I've purchased several Belkin cables and they always seem to be well made.  Only problem with this particular cable is that it is not USB 2.0 which I didn't realize when I bought it.  I had intended to attach it to another cable which I purchased at the same time.  According to the instructions, it is not advisable.The mistake was completely mine.  I just didn't think to check for USB 2.0 when I purchased it.",positive
"Its your standard USB extension cable. Quality was very good, then ends were molded for durability. Time will tell how well its made.",positive
"As usual with Belkin products, this cable works great and is quality made. I got it to be able to charge my Turtle Beach XP400 headset while I am using them, since the only plug I can use that won't be in the way is behind the couch on the other side of the living room. It works great, keeping me in the game longer. Definitely a great buy. I would recommend this cable.",positive
"good cable, serve it purpose. I also use it to extend the range on my lightning cable to charge my iphone 5",positive
I recently had to move my COMPUTER. In doing so I used this USB cable to extend the reach of my MOUSE. What I like most about BELKIN USB cables is that they don't pull apart at the joints as easily as the other LESS EXPENSIVE ones!,positive
"Works well, with no signal glitches. For an electronic device extensioncable that's a big deal.  It carries a good, strong signal.",positive
"I use this to extend the receiver of a wireless presentation remote.  Works great and by a reputable company.  It replaced one that I purchased online that stopped working when I dropped it out of a window accidentally.  (Ironically, the wireless receiver didn't break when it hit the floor, just the USB extender - so I bought this to replace it.)",positive
"This USB extension is just what I was hoping it would be. I bought a USB scanner recently, and I wanted it placed on top of a shelf away from my computer. This cord solved the distance problem with ease. I have noticed no change in the scanners performance since adding this extension cable.",positive
"WAS USING THIS FOR MY PRINTER TO HOOK UP TO MY LAPTOP, WORKED FINE FOR AWHILE BUT FOR SOME REASON IT STOPPED WORKING. MY LAPTOP DOES NOT RECOGNIZE PRINTER WHEN I USE THIS. i AM GETTING A DIFFERENT ONE ARRIVING TOMORROW, HOPE IT LASTS LONGER.I'M SURPRISED BECAUSE I LIKE BELKIN PRODUCTS.",neutral
The cables work great. I like the quality and I haven't had a problem with them at all. Thanks for a quality and fair priced product.,positive

Inexpensive compared to cables at Best Buy.Does exactly what it is supposed to do!,positive
"While I'm sure the cable works fine, be careful about what you need it for.I too thought I was buying a USB cable that I could connect two computers.  I believed this because it is an ""A/A"" extension cable.  Indeed, the key word is ""extension.""  Normally, ""A/A"" would mean the same type of connector but not in this case.",negative
Not much you can really add to such a device as an extension cable. They either work or they don't and these two do.....so I'm happy. If you need to extend your usb device then these is a great purchase.,positive
it's a cable.  It was cheap.  Why pay big prices for the gold plated extra special ones when this will do the job.,positive
"Works well. I used this as part of a wok-fi (wifi-antenna). A strainer served as a receiver dish, and boosted my signal, since my home's wifi-doesn't completely reach my shop, unassisted.",positive
Needed a USB extension cable for a KVM that I purchased.  Always had good luck with Belkin products and this one didn't disappoint.,positive
Seems to be a high quality cable. I am very satisfied.,positive
"This works for the practical things such as printers and keyboards. However, if you need to connect something that is data heavy and requires the use of USB 2.0, such as an external hard drive or a HD camera, you need to look elsewhere.That being said, the high price disappoints me for such old technology. Although, it overall depends on what you need it for.",neutral
This cable works just like it should. I use it to have an extension on my Wii controllers when I play without needing any movement. That way they stay charged while I waste my life away.,positive
"The cable I received is not a Belkin cable.  It is a cheap no name cable. The picture is of a gray cable with the Belkin name molded in the plastic ends.  I received a cheap thin plain black cable in a clear plastic bag with the made in china sticker. It was sold by ""marginmart inc"" and fulfilled by amazon.  I feel I was lied to and ripped off.",negative
"The cable itself is good, looks durable and works fine.The only thing I don't like is the color. It's kind of gray, so it looks old.",positive
This USB extension cable works as described.  One end of the cable has a female USB adopter to accept a regular male USB connector.,positive
Now I can plug my iPad in almost anywhere in my home. What a great find. Very happy with this product.,positive
Well made cable that I am using to extend my web cam's distance from my cpu so I can have a wider view of the room.,positive
I have always been impressed with the quality of Belkin cables and this one is no exception.  It works exactly as one would expect and is nice and flexible with positive connectors.,positive
The Belkin cables are well made.  I've found them consistently solid in all that I've purchased from them.,positive
"Bought a new computer where the usb plugins were at the bottom and my Logitech camera for skyping no longer would reach my monitor, so this fit perfectly and allowed me to place the camera where it once was.",positive
"I bought a couple of these to extend a few things farther away from my computer to crate more space. It works as it was indented to do. I never had any problems with it, just plug and play and your all set. Whats more great about this product is that its cheap. I bought 2 of these extension cables for a total of $5.",positive
"I've had this for a while. I use it so that I can use my phone or tablet in bed while charging. Eventually, it stopped charging them as well. It's inconsistent. Good price, but I would like a more reliable cable.",neutral
"This item is exactly what it claims to be: a very long USB extension.  Male to female, gray, stylishly modern.  Who cares?  It's a cable, not a car.  There isn't that much to screw up.",positive
Always in need for a USB extension for some reason.  This cable works as described.,positive
I used a 3ft USB extension cable that came with my device: it worked perfectlyI used THIS 10ft USB extension cable from Belkin: the computer said there was a problem with my USB device every time I tried to connect itMoral of the story: this cable from Belkin does not function properly. Don't buy it.,negative
"I have needed USB extentions but they are hard to find and too expensive when I do find them. They cost as much as a DVD player, lol. This is a good product at a fair price get 4 you can use them in a 100 places.",positive
can now operate my trackball from a longer distance.well worth the money.i bought two as you cannot find this length in to many stores.,positive
"It's a cable, what more do you need to know? It's heavy enough and works, good bran I've used before and will use again if the need arises.",positive
"If you go to Radio Shack, or Best Buy, or Staples, you will find the same cable for $30 or more! The cable is the same as those more expensive one, and EVEN has easy opening package!  Love the cables, and the price.",positive
"It doesn't say anywhere in the listing that I could find that this isn't USB 2.  My mistake for just assuming it was, I guess.  Still, I think they should make it obvious that it isn't 2, since that's pretty much the standard today.",negative
Works great! Exactly what I needed for my room.  Running a connection through the e-sata to my computer and through usb to my ps3.  (just not at the same time.),positive
I used this to extend the USB port off the back of a TV so we wouldn't have to get up anytime it was used.,positive
"This cable is advertised as having ""480 Mbps transmission speed"" which is false. On the packaging it says only 12 Mbps, meaning this is NOT a USB 2.0 cable. Be careful! I would have left one star but thankfully Amazon let me return the cable without any hassle.",negative
This works perfect to plug our external hard drive into out HDTV so the hard drive isn't hanging from the back of the TV. We watch 1080 HD movies through it every weekend!! And the price is excellent too!!! Way cheaper than the cable I found in the electronic stores!! Highly recommend!,positive
I like to set my printers on separate tables and not take up my desk space on hardware that is better left working across the room. Great product great price.,positive
"Okay, it's a USB cable but it is 10 foot long.  Works fine and allowed me to move the printer further away from my computer desk.",positive
"What else can I say? it works and its worth the money. I trust Belkin, they make great products",positive
"Very nice.  This allows me to comfortably use my computer  while on my 55 inch bravia from the comfort of my couch. It has been stepped on, run over, chewed and generally mistreated and still works great. I bought them two years ago..",positive
I needed to add a few feet to my webcam to place it on my flat panel. As always Belkin did the job with no visible loss of quality.,positive
The product is great and handy if your are trying to extend the cable of your usb devices. Good Built Quality and easy to use. Fast shipping as usual from Amazon,positive
"Works great, nice to have the printer away from the PC on the desk. Gives me more room on my desk.",positive
great price and works very well. great price and works very well great price and works very wellgreat price and works very well,positive
Works as advertised....and its Belkin...so you know you are in good tangles!!  Ok I made that up.....good tangles.  HAHA..But Seriously..great cables....,positive
"This is a great cable  I  needed something long and had a price concern, when I received in the mail I realized  this is a decent quality cable! Thanks",positive
"It is exactly what I wanted, the delivery was perfectly on time and it was very easy to install it. I will definitely recommend this product. Thank you",positive
great design the cable seems like it will last a long time.The cable I received is a shiny blue color.I recommend it.,positive
"I use this for my Hauppauge HD PVR. The USB cord on that is only 6ft long and my PC is far away. I got this and it worked just like it should.Who says you need a name brand?Also, the picture is a gray USB Extender. I got a Black USB Extender. Which I actually like more. Keep that in mind.",positive
Good product for a good price. Would recommend to anyone who needs an usd extension cable. Sure beats the price of the local electronics stores.,positive

"I bought two of these, one for a usb power extension for my turtle beach headset, and another for a data cable. both of these work well. I pulled them out of the box, and thought ""oh man, these look stiff"" but no, they are nice a and supple wile still feeling heavy duty.",positive
"For the buck, Olympus gives you a better lens than any other consumer level camera. I love the shots I've taken with this camera... great colour, focus, and sharpness.",positive
"I've had only good results with the Stylus. It takes wonderful pics, is very handy to tote around, and takes quite a beating. (My 1st Stylus was a 35mm model and it resided on an open shelf in a boat for 4 years without misfiring once). My only disappointment has been the red-eye reduction, though contact lenses make a real challenge for any direct flash unit I've seen.",positive
"Even with 200 ISO film (the manual recommends ISO 400), this camera takes very sharp indoor/outdoor pictures with brilliant colors. Haven't tried the 400 film yet, so I'm eager to try some outdoor evening pictures. However, with the 200 film, this camera still took some excellent night pictures (using a tripod) of downtown during Christmas season. Don't regret buying it one bit, best investment in a long time.",positive
"I've had this radio for 8 years now and still going strong.  The weather band has always been poor in my area (which is why only 4 stars), but other than that no complaints. Oh, and obviously the TV function is no longer usefull, but I didn't get it for that. This is a small radio that does a good job pulling in stations.",positive
I've had a lot of problems with other radios to obtain adequate reception in my home area. This radio was far superior and brought in all the stations clearly. I wish that the user interface was easier to use but the performance makes up for it. No regrets.,positive
"This is a great little radio. Very light weight for walking and it has the TV channels in addition to the standard AM/FM reception.I have trouble falling asleep at night and I put on the headphones, tune in to a talk radio station and drift off to sleep. The sleep timer turns it off in an hour.USE rechargable Ni-Mh batteries on this and save a bunch.",positive
"I use this more than any other item in the shop and have never regretted purchasing it a few years ago.  It truly is bomb proof.So buy once and be done with it.On a side note, Amazon CS was excellent in shipping a replacement unit overnight after UPS ""lost"" the first one.",positive
Excellent product I have used for months.  The cord easily retracts.  Easy to hook up.  Great for the center of the garage,positive
"I've been using this on an almost daily basis for a few months now.Pros:Plenty of length for your average size garageCan mount on the ceilingCons:Retracting mechanism can be finicky , but has much stronger recoil then others Ive usedI would definitely recommend this to anyone, just be prepared to fight with the recoil until you get the hang of it.",positive
"Simple review for a simple product -- it's just a good cord reel.Triple head is nice, circuit breaker is nice.Mounting is easy, and hardware is included for both ceiling and wall mounting.Smooth feeding out and reeling in of cord.",positive
"I like the product, however after doing some research I found what I believe to be the EXACT same reel at sears for $24.95. I actually purchased one from Sears when they were offering it for $18 and some change. The construction is identical but the one from Sears does not have a circuit breaker, to me that's not a big deal.  Other then that so far it works like I expected it to.",positive
"Pretty sweet piece of kit. Suspends from the ceiling well, the rectracting assembly works well. Some people may complain that it is only 16 gauge, but it works well for quick jobs in a workshop.",positive
"I have a Radio Shack branded version of this unit... same design... works fine... good sound, memory works as supposed to... reception seems solid... recommend",positive
I got this and a refurb. Sony walkman to serve as wireless stereo headsets for my Home theater.This is a very nice radio.I have seen it offered for as much as seventy dollars in other places on the web.,positive
"I have bought many small radios over the years, including others by Sangean.  I was very disappointed with this one. It looks cheap, feels cheap, and has mediocre sound.  For the price, I was expecting better. I know I could have bought a much nicer radio for less money.",negative
"The shortwave radio is great. Very light weight and the main reason is for times in hurricanes when Electrical companies shuts down the power. I also purchased some eneloop AA rechargeable batteries to use with this shortwave radio.Very good for listening to other stations globally. Highly recommended for everyone at home,individuals camping and all others involved in some form of technology with radios.",positive
"This is a basic am/fm clock radio if that's what you need, it looks nice sounds nice, and works however if you need single sideband you need to look at the ATS 909.",neutral
"This is a good little radio: good reception, good tone, good controls. Its only weak point is its size, though, too big for a beach robe pocket, too small to stand up on its own on a beach towel. but otherwise, I'm as happy as a clam in the off-season with it.",neutral
"I had this radio (from Radio Shack) for some 5+ years and it always was one nice, easy to use, reliable, with nice reception, nice alarm ""human"" system device!I gave it to my dad and he still using it daily. The only thing is the price. It is hard to swallow an idea of $100+ for a radio. But the device itself it superb.",positive
"Owned one of these for about 4 years and dropped it several weeks ago.  Replaced it with another one last week.  Works great on all bands, SSB and synchronus detection would be a nice addition though.",positive
"I got this radio November 9th, and am not pleased. The reception isn't that great, and the F.M. has too much override; where you hear the same station on adjacent frequencies. Unless it's a very strong station, you have to tune away from the nearby station to get anything. Sangean could've done better.",negative
"I had this radio for 4 months before it stopped working. It is made very cheaply and does not justify its price. The battery cover in the back kept falling from the day one (nothing was broken), just sign of poor quality control and fit and finish. It ended up in trash somewhere. Will not buy Sangean brand.",negative
Reception is super for it's size. I bought this radio primarily for listening to FM and talk radio. I don't listen to shortwave. My favorite FM stations  come clear and stereo-like.,positive
"It's got everything I needed in a compact battery powered radio.As others have noted, the tuning floats a little over time, but the SW and AM and FM bands work fine.  Good for the garage or working in the yard.",positive
"I'm very pleased with the quality and performance of this radio. For the money it's hard to beat. Not a lot of features, but that's why other radios cost more. Good reception. I recommend this radio.",positive
"I have had one of these receivers in my collection for about 17-18 years.  I have been worried it will stop working, so I looked around for a new one to replace it, found it and the price and delivery were great.  Radio arrived new and well packed exactly like I expected.  Nothing bad here, this purchase is all good.",positive
This is a great radio.  Mine is about 15 years old.  It is very easy to use.  The only thing I do not like is that the SW band is not continuous.  It is missing the ham frequencies.,positive
"Nice starter radio for SW lots of freq to tune, live near the beach and the many stationcome in OK ( Not great OK ) Hey its a Nice starter radio, also Bought the FR200 Now thats great",neutral
"A fellow reviewer named Mary L. Stein ""TALK SHOW JUNKIE"" writes:>> despite the advertising there is NO AM BAND ON THIS RADIO!!This is quite untrue.  This radio has AM Band, it is however labeled as ""MW"" (as opposed to being labeled ""AM"").  ""MW"" stands for ""Medium Wave"" and is just another name for ""AM"" (which stands for Amplitude Modulation).  Although labeled differently, it is quite obvious once one uses this radio that MW are the AM stations.",neutral
love this very good to have no power works on battery has different channels good to have around use it for home and traveling camping,positive
I wasn't able to get any of the major shortwave channels like Voice of America and Radio Europe and BBC but the FMband works pretty good.,neutral
"Just okay in my opinion, I got this radio to be able to listen to NPR and BBC news at home. Reception in my home in Santa Fe, New Mexico is just okay, not great, pretty fuzzy most of the time. A little disappointing, but since it was inexpensive, no great loss. Maybe it will work better in other places.",neutral
"Receives wonderfully, but cheaply made. Hope volumn knob stays  on for a while. BL",positive
"I own a Sony ICF-2010, Grundig YB400 and just purchased the ATS-909. Of the three I would give the ATS-909 the lowest score. It definitely lacks the sensitivity of the other two. (Though connecting an external antenna helps greatly but defeats the purpose of a portable radio.) And I find the audio quality to be muddled and tiring to listen to.If you're looking for a good portable I would also recommend the Grundig YB400 or the new Sony ICF-7600GR.",neutral
"This is the exact same radio when it comes to reception as the sangean ATS 505 it just has more ""bells and whistles"".",positive
"This is a nice little switch.  It has a rugged case, rear ports, and frontside link lights.  It took about 30 seconds to replace my Base10 hub with this device and it has been silently blinking along ever since.",positive
"Does what a ethernet switch should. Nice 10/100 indicator lights. I plugged this switch into another d-link switch to add more ports in my wife's office. No crossing cables required. I recommend this switch. Please note that I bought mine ""used"" for under $10, which is about the max I would ever pay for a 5 port switch.....",positive
"I have this little switch installed under my desk to connect my PC and various peripherals (external hard drive, printer, FAX, etc.).  Has given me years of reliable service.",positive
I've been using this switch non-stop ever since I bought it years ago and it has been fully functional.,positive
Hurrah! Not much to report except that it's as painless as technology will ever get. You plug it in and now you have more ports. Success!,positive
"I have typically been a Linksys only customer, but being frustrated with some of their products lately I decided to make a switch, and I'm glad I did.  It's compact design makes it easy to tuck it away. I have yet to have a problem with the 2 that I bought, one for home and one for work.  They have been running 6 months and counting with all the ports active in both locations.",positive
"This is a great swicth with low price.  I use it together with D-Link DI-704 4-port internet sharing router to build my home network with 1 PC, two servers, one PowerMac and a laptop connected to cable modem ISP. Connecting via the swicth for internet sharing doesn't show any noticeable slow-response as compared to connecting via the router directly.  It works well by itself as we as with D-Link DI-704.",positive
I have had this for awhile and have not had any problems.  I have a camera and some other things plugged into it.  It is nice not having to worry about running out of USB connections.,positive
"I could not get this thing to work.  Tried it on Windows XP, 2000, and 98SE.  Windows simply will not recognize this device.  I work in a Tech Support center and have fairly in-depth technical skills.  I've also had other technically adept people look at it, with same results.  I'll try Belkin or Linksys now but I'd steer clear of this item.",negative
"This hub is really very easy to install. Plug it and you're done! The AC adapter is included in case the devices need more power. It can be used without the adapter as well. It looks great, it's very small so it doesn't occupied precious space and it's affordable.",positive
No real problems what-so-ever getting this to work...  My only gripe is that it &quot;seems&quot; to slow the boot up of Windows by a good 3 or 4 seconds.  Otherwise a great product at a great price!!,positive
"Plug it in and plug in your USB accessories and it works like a charm.  No more fumbling in the back of your PC box to pull out the USB connector of an accessory you are not using to plug in one you want to use.  The connections are in the front of the Dlink box.  Good price compared to Linksys, Belkin and other competitive models.  I am quite happy I bought this hub.",positive
"There's not much to say about this product.  I just plugged it in and instantly forgot about it!  I was a bit skeptical because most USB hubs tend to be a bit pricier, but the D-Link hub works great and it can't get any easier to set it up.  I love the compact design as well.  This one is definately a no-brainer.",positive
This is an excellent product.  Installation was super easy.  Performance is flawless.  It's pretty nice not having to pull my computer out of it's corner and try to find usb ports in the dark.  Even if you don't need extra ports it's nice to have them all out front.,positive
"Simple to hook up and use. Includes an external power supply that the instructions say is optional, but that should be used.  The USB subsystem provides power to many of the accessories that attach to it (card readers, etc.) If you don't use the power supply, attaching more than two devices will overtax the USB system and stop all devices from working.  So use the power supply immediately and you're all set.  Great value, led's show port status.",positive
"the standard of 2 USB ports for computers isn't really enough.. I have a  PDA Cradle, Webcam, Intellimouse Explorer, Scanner, and a Zip 250 drive  that all use USB ports, and it gets to be a hassle having to switch them  around all the time.Hub works great, i reccommend it",positive
"This is a terrific value!  I've expanded my laptop's single USB port into four - quickly and easily.  Even though I had read some mixed reviews, my experience has been very positive so far!  You really don't need to spend more money on another hub - this one's a great value, reliable and is nice-looking too.  I wouldn't think twice about buying this product.",positive
"Yes, it greatly improves reception when attached to a telescopic antenna using the included clip. It gave me air traffic and SW. Wish it came with BNC adaptor though. Good for the price for a lazy guy like me. I guess you can get the same results with a long wire and a curtain clip.",positive
"For the price, it will really help bring in some stations. rolls up nice and small for travel. helped some distant stations really clear up and I found some neat number station (yes they can still be found) with it, hehe",positive
"No a good purchase, Not a good helper, not even a good antenna. It helps with signal and of course with noise.It was a very expensive shipping. Same as antenna.",negative
"If you don't want to spend much money for improved reception on a portable SW radio, this is a good choice.  I purchased one and it really does help bring in signals that are too weak when using only the built-in telescoping antenna.This is a handy little portble antenna.",positive
"This antenna did not work at all. The only good thing I can say is that is was cheap enough that I didn't go to the bother of sending it back, just into the trash.",negative
"Really like this antenna.  just wish it was a bit longer, like a total of 30 feet long.  Have it set up in living room near ceiling and does what it is suppose to do.",positive
"Wow.  This is a good range extender.  I am new to the shortwave game, but I must say, this is a good antenna for my YB300PE.  I am hearing stations I didn't think I'd be able to get.  I am new to the whole shortwave genre, but this is good.  It is very easy to use and it does add to your antennas normal range.",positive
For a reasonably priced antenna this is a great product. Use with a mulitband radio that gets carried outside frequently. Compact size and long antenna make this unit very adaptable. I Velcro'd the case to the back of the radio for easy carrying. Pull the antenna out as far as necessary to get a signal. I found the antenna wire to be quite long and durable.,positive
I bought this for emergencies and have not tried it out yet. It is for my bug out kit and hope I do not have to use it for that scenario.The shipping was fast and the description was correct.I would recommend to anyone.,positive
very nice antenna easy to use and the fact that it was compact made it easy to use and to store,positive
Easy to use and put away. I kept the one that came with the radio with the radio. I put this one up permanently at home for quick use.,positive
Is exactly what it is described as. A 23 ft portable antenna.  Easily pulls out of the case and and you have a long wire antenna.  Attach to your radio using the 3.5-millimeter mini plug or clip it on to the radio's external antenna. Winds back in with no problem. Very good deal for the price.,positive
"Good alternative for a portable antenna or if you cannot have an outside antenna. Works surprisingly well. Can give you more noise when used inside, but still better than using the whip alone.",positive
"This short wave antenna has increased my reception on my shortwave radio by more than 50% over just using the radios own antenna. It has increased my reception on all bands including AM, FM, TV, and shortwave bands. Installing the add on antenna is a breeze. Highly recommended.",positive
this thing is just a hunk of wire. it works just like any other piece of wire. it just is on a spool that lets you wind it back in. nothing magic here.,neutral
"This antenna is excellent. I placed it on my rooftop and I was able to pull in signals from all over the world. It is worth the price to buy it. By Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL",positive
I coundn't believe is was so reasonably priced .  I have wanted one of them for a very long time,positive
"I used this with my tecsun pl-606. Indoors it did nothing. Outdoors, I hung it from my 2nd story balcony. It brought in over three times as many stations than using the whip antenna. For stations I could get in without it, the signal was cleaner and stronger. It worked better when plugged in than when clipped on (even though when clipped it still showed an improvement). It is very easy to reel in when done.",positive
This is a great antenna that makes a huge difference in reception.. Just attach it to the in/out plug and watch it work.,positive
"I works just fine with my little Sony shortwave radio.  I like the fact that it retracts making it easily portable.  It is definitely not an outside antenna with regard to reception, but it is significantly better than the little factory antenna.  I would recommend it to others as a starter antenna for receiving shortwave broadcasts.",positive
"I live in an appartment complex which is brick and I don't get cell phone signals,so I didn't get much from this antenna from my appartment.I will try again outdoors and give another review at a latter date.Two stars for now not knowing how this works yet,nice concept if it works outdoors.Very portable.",negative
"I have several wind up antennas.  They all work&#8230;..they are all just a convenient long-wire.  The added whip-clip is very handy.  For the price, i'd by another one when i need it.",positive
Wire is a bit thin but doesn't affect the operation of the devices. The wire antenna that came with my shortwave only had a clip on which was not convenient. This one has 3.5 jack for external antenna and clearly get me better reception across all bands. Probably the best overall antenna in a super portable package. Recommended.,positive
The signals improved significantly = if there are no blockage from buildings etc and if it is high the signals are excellent.,positive
It's a good little unit. But remember it's only a portable and will just improve reception so much. I do recommend it for its quality and portability.,positive
This antenna will easily improve your inexpensive shortwave's reception. My old SonySony ICFSW7600G Worldband Radio Receivershortwave picked up stations that were never possible with the built-in antenna.,positive
"I purchased the Tecsun PL-660SLV to put away in a faraday cage in case of emergency and wanted an external antenna.  Even though there is really no gain, this antenna allows portability and the ability to have something outside away from inside walls and interference. Not bad for the money. This would also be great for a portable antenna to take with you on the go!",positive
It coils nicely without hanging up.  Comes with a coupler to clip onto other radio extending antennas.  Not a replacement for a home-based antenna.  Good for what it is: a travel antenna.,positive
"This hard drive was received in good shape and has worked in my NAS box in a RAID-1 configuration.  I have not profiled it for performance, but it is working flawlessly alongside another 1TB Seagate in the RAID-1 configuration.",positive
The drive arrived quickly and answered my needs. I have it installed with another 500GB drive and I am happy with the performance. I am especially grateful for the good packing and quick shipping.,positive
"This drive failed after 5 months use.  I'm RMA'ing it now as it's under warranty but just lost a ton of data.  Apparently this model has MANY issues that cause it to fail BOTH hardware design and firmware. Definitely not a good combination!Thanks a lot Seagate, you just lost all my future business.",negative
Bought this when it was in the goldbox for a friend.  He has 4 setup in a raid and it seems to be working great.  They just work.  Seagate has never steered me wrong.,positive

Perhaps Amazon has done some retraining of their warehouse crew since the earlier complaints were posted?  My 1TB OEM Seagate Barracuda was packaged very securely inside of foam padding similar to what is found in the packaging for retail Seagate drives.This box was then placed inside of a second box for shipping.It only took 4 business days to arrive via USPS!  Thumbs up to Amazon for their care in packaging of this drive for shipment.,positive
"The disk arrived UPS, I installed, formatted and used it in a Windows Home Server.  It came right up and continues to work fine.  I somehow missed the fact that it was an OEM product, which means no box, just shrink wrap.  No cables, just the drive.",positive
"I had bought 2 of these for my home server and one of the 2 failed. AMAZON was awesome and 'overnighted' me a replacement drive. I sent Amazon the request to replace the drive around 4:00 p.m. one day and the new one was in my hands around 10:00 a.m. the next morning. If that's not great service, I dpn't know what is. + after getting the replacement drive the remaining 2 drives work fantastic. Thanks, Amazon!",positive
"Died in less than 4 months. I brought this from Amazon.com. Now I have contacted Seagate for warranty purpose. They said I need to ship the item at my expense and wait for 2-4 weeks for replacement (Probably another rectified/refurbished brick). Not worthy, total waste of time and money!Another Chinese garbage.",negative
This product have been serving my need for over four years with out any problemI've had WD black which is also very reliable but I went with this because it's cheaper..I'm sticking with seagate and wd only,positive
"I'm surprised more people have not posted about what a disaster this product is, with many many early failures.  There is a very long and heated thread on Seagate forums:[...]Mine:  Installed 24 Nov 2008, died 19 Jan 2009, with about 60 hours of video files I had copied from family camcorder tapes at 1x.Too bad to see a company that used to have a fine reputation going down the toilet.",negative
"This drive was ordered as a replacement drive after one of these failed in my NAS due to power failure (Actually, daughter with a flat iron).  I received it quickly and it installed and was up in seconds.  The other drive is still going strong.",positive
"Great hard disk. Very quiet and fast operation. With a SATA installation, it is very easy to route cable around the inside of the box.",positive
"This is indeed an OEM drive - came with no warranty card, no SATA cable, screws, shipping list, manual or any other insert. If this drive goes south I don't have much of a paper trail to help me send it back. Purchased from Tech for Less through Amazon. I guess they ran out of them because the seller is now some other outfit.",neutral
"This was purchased for an office.  For some reason I cannot format the drive from windows, I need to use the seagate program I downloaded from seagates site.  This doesn't make the drive a bad drive, I just do not feel as comfortable with it as I do others I have purchased that windows will format.  The awkward install and setup is the only reason for the lower score.",neutral
This unit also is an exact replacement for a second RAID sytem I needed.Shipped on time and properly packeged.Many Thanks!  :) Mark,positive

"The dern thing is almost TOO quiet. Just intalled 2 of them raid 1. I can't tell when they're spinning. WOW!If you are installing in an older pc, like me, that doesn't support sata 3.0, you will need a jumper (not included) to change to sata 1.5.",positive
Worst Drives Ever! Had 3 fail already none due to excessive heat or impact. The WD drives I purchased at the same time are still going strong. Buy what you'd like but I'm sticking with WD.,negative
"It bricked right around the six month mark. My BIOS won't even recognize that it exists anymore. I've switched SATA cables and power plugs and tried it in a completely different machine and it still isn't recognized and so I'm reasonably certain that it just plain failed. I am a complete backup fanatic and it is still under warranty so this is nothing more than a slight hassle for me personally, but beware!",negative
Excellent Disk Drive.  1GB.  Fast. Easy To Install.  Great Amazon Price ($89) Fast Delivery.  No problems.  Remember to buy a Molex to Sata Power Cable Adapter.  Needed for older systems with Molex  Power only.  Converts 4 pin Molex to SATA power (15 Pin).,positive
This drive performs without fail.  I have seven of these 1 GB hard drives and all have been excellent.  I use these formatted with a Mac so I can speak only for Mac performance.,positive
"Seagate is knowingly selling a faulty hard drive that just up and decides to not be seen by the computer one day. You will lose everything on it. No it does not stop working, you can hear it spinning and there is no warning to this happening. When you contact them they try to charge you $400 or more to retrieve your data for you.",negative
I have absolutely no complains for this HD. Excellent performance and for a good price.100% Recommended!!,positive
"I have had two of these die on me and have had to backup all of my data and move to new drives.  This is unacceptable!  It takes a good day to transfer all of your stuff to a new drive, reload Windows, reinstall all software, etc.  These drives are crap.",negative
"I have owned three of these drives now, and all three have failed in a matter of months. Thankfully I've been using them as one disk in a RAID, so I haven't lost any data yet, but this failure rate is unacceptable. Meanwhile, the Western Digital drives in my RAID have been chugging along for over 3 years without issue. Do *not* buy these Seagate drives unless you want to lose data.",negative
All versions of this drive manufactured prior to Jan 2009 may be affected by a serious firmware bug. A firmware update has been released but according to multiple reports the update may brick this drive. I would recommend staying away from this model until the affected drives are out of the supply chain.,negative
I use this in an external hard drive case and have owned it for over a year. It worked fine for me. I partitioned this without any issues. It has not given me any issues till date. I have it hooked to my WDTV and it works flawlessly.The speed on this is blocked to 1.5Gbps by a jumper. Remove the jumper to bring out it's full potential of 3.0Gbps.Would definitely recommend it.,positive
"WE have purchased dozens of these drives between 2009 and 2010.Over half have died.  36 out of 60.  One hard drive to stayfar far away.  The 36 that ""died"" just bricked out.  Badfirmware, etc.  Its amazing how Seagate has yet to be suedfor issuing so many dead drives.  Well, they are paying theprice as their competitors are catching up with them.Guaranteed:  Seagate will not have the title of ""bestselling"" hard drive maker after 2011.Daniel J. Tyler  (The WJG)",negative
Everything fine. Good shipping. Nice deal. Drive works fine. Fairly fast. A good workhorse hard drive. I am very happy with this deal.,positive
"Easily installed in my generic brand Windows Home Server.  Plenty of space now for shared files, backups of laptops, etc.  I had to buy a SATA cable at our local computer recycling store for $2 but it fired right up.",positive
"Despite the many reviews stating the poor quality of the product I thought I'd give it a go based on the few reviews in its favor. I should have listened...and you should too. The converter is worthless, but if you're wanting to spend a bit more just for the adaptors go for it, but I'd look elsewhere. After merely turning on the electrical device the converted popped, smoked and was no longer effective...or rather, was NEVER affective.",negative
I took this converter to a very long European trip. It worked just fine. My family members were using it for both high-wattage and low-wattage appliances. It was very handy to have a single converter for all cases. What can I say - it worked as supposed and didn't break. The set of 5 different adapters (all types used on the planet) was very handy too.,positive
"I'm disappointed to report that my unit blew out after a few days of modest use.  It was plugged-into a standard 220-volt outlet in a UK hotel.  But it overheated witin 15 minutes and had to be shut down frequently.  Now I am using a Tacima step-down transformer.  Look into the Proctor-SIlex model as well.  This Recoton couldn't handle the job, and I was using the 50-watt setting.",negative
"This is a great adapter/converter for international travel.  with a trip to several european countries & the UK, this was just what we needed. The only issue i had was w/ the weight.  it's rather heavy so we chose to put it on our carry on which we then had to deal w/.  i would buy this same one again though",positive
"This set, with the case and various different converters is nice for the price. It is well made and practical for travel all over. I usually just look up which one I will need for the country I am visiting and take only that.",positive
"This converter has everything you need while traveling abroad. Good fit, good function, good price. A real necessity!",positive
"My wife needed this for her trip to China.It worked great, till she blew it up by not checking the settings before she plugged a new item into it.The price . . . 1/3rd of what Radio Shack was going to charge for the same setup.So all in all, we were very pleased with this purchase.",positive
"You get what you pay for. I've used it with US electronics in Ireland without any problems. I've used DVD players, Recharged batteries but not used it for anything heavy duty. Seems the same product is sold under many different names.",positive
"While it's a bit hefty in its box, I take only the adapters I'll need. Weight aside, the wife and I have used these adapters in Europe, England, Scotland (6 countries in all); it has worked perfectly for two years and lots of travel. Used it for everything from digital cameras to electic shavers and cell phones.",positive
"It worked fine for charging camera batteries, etc. When it was used with a hair dryer, it went up in smoke. If you are planning on using it for light duty, it should do just fine, but don't plan on running heavier loads through it.",neutral
"This kit is well made, contains all the plug adapters you'll need to travel to 6 continents, and unlike some, has switchable wattage to allow the use of both low voltage (eg. battery rechargers) and high voltage (eg. hair dryers) appliances.",positive
I took this thing to Tokyo.  It was basically a waste of space.  I'm not sure if it was the voltage in Tokyo or if I just got a busted piece of equipment.  It would charge my phone with it but it would only last a few minutes so I just plugged it straight into the wall and it worked even better.,neutral
I used this product successfully in the UK to recharge my camera and heat the flat iron for my hair. I would not recommend keeping things plugged in overnight or left unattended to recharge. The main step down units gets very hot.,positive
My wife recently traveled to Germany with this unfortunate converter choice.  It failed to operate.  I caught several of the other reviews on this item that also indicated instant or premature death. Think there might be a trend.  I can not recommend.,negative
I fought it for someone who lives over seas. She already have one which is her neighbors  so she wanted one so I looked up the name and it came up. I read the reviews and bought it right away. it comes with many useful adapters so that it doesn't matter where you go there should be allrite.,positive
This is a product I had before and it is simple to hookup and it works great with no problems,positive
"I've had one of these, running it on and off for 15 years. I bought it to connect my Pentium 166 with an Riva TNT2 to play the original Diablo and Duke Nukem 3D. Now I use it to bridge to my TV. I can't believe they're still available.",positive
"Perfect for classrooms. Small, unobtrusive and works right out of the box. Had a room of students working on computers in 10 minutes.",positive
"They don't mention is clearly enough that this is not a gigabit switch, waste of my money since I missed the 30 day return window. It sat in the box for over a month since the project was delayed.",negative
"I have purchased many switches and have found the Netgear ones such as this 8 port to be very dependable.  As with all lan switches however, even these are vulnerable to electrical surges so they should be installed behind high quality surge protection.",positive
This is one of three I own. I use this as a remote switch just for the ease of connection and the size of it.,positive
Great for LAN parties and hasn't failed me yet! Good buy for the price as well especially with how many ports you get.,positive
"I ended up mistakenly ordering this, instead of a gigabit switch.  Mostly my fault, but not what I wanted.  Oops.",neutral
"I have used a number of Netgear switches and routers over the years and find the FS108 to be simple, rugged, reliable and fast enough at a low price. I used this switch as the central distribution point for CAT6 cable runs in lieu of a more elaborate backboard installation. The switch is wall-mounted in a utility closet and easily accessible if we need to make changes. The switch is as described and was delivered on time.",positive
"Netgear provides an excellent, durable, professional network switch.  And Amazon offers it at an UNBEATABLE low price!  Excellent.  This router works fine with all of the hardware including a Brother Laser Printer, an Apple iMac, and a Windows Desktop Machine.  This switch will give you your best bang for your buck, guaranteed!",positive
The first switch broke after 10 years of use. Replaced it with an identical switch. Will see how this one lasts.Did not notice any issues with performance. Does the job.,positive
"I purchased this switch 3 years agohappy with it, however, the supplied power adaptor seems not to provide enough current, it runs hotit seems to have more current power adaptor to run (at least 2A, do not use the supplied adaptor)now I install it vertically on the wall, just warm to touch (just use 3 out of 8)for more stable operation, a stronger power supply is recommended (at least 12-15V 2A)",positive
great price use a lot of them,positive
"I bought this to wire my entertainment room with Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi, as my router's signal is spotty at times.  I have an iMac, Apple TV, and BluRay player all hooked up ti this switch.  There is no buffering when watching any streaming service on any device.  Highly recommend this for those with weak or spotty Wi-Fi signals.",positive
We have ordered more of these since this one and it does a fantastic job.  Quality product and it served the purpose that we needed it for.,positive
"The power connector on my FS108 is very sensitive - try to shift the unit or move the power cord in any way and it goes into a fit, flashing all lights and all connected devices indicate they have lost their network connection. My friend reports the same problems with his. Mine is being relegated to the spares drawer as soon as I purchase a replacement - not another Netgear. A shame, it is otherwise a nice switch.",negative
"I couldn't find an 8-port wireless router that I liked, so I reverted to using this switch. It works perfectly and since each port is auto-sensing, you don't have to fiddle with which port is the uplink port. Reasonable priced as well. You can spend half as much for Chinese knockoffs, but I don't want to take chances like that -- all these packets need to get to the right place error free.",positive
Works as advertised.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable 8-port switch for home use.  This is very plug it in and go...there's really not much to it.,positive
"Good all-around switch for home applications.  Easy setup.  Compact size.  I'd recommend that anyone buy these.  Simple way to expand your internal network, especially in new construction.",positive
"When it arrived, one of the ports didnt work.  I dont know if this is common with Netgear products, but this one is not worth the price.  Will not buy this brand again.  Going with Cisco.",negative
"Does what it's supposed to do.  Great deal for the price.  I'd buy another one of these, if the need arises.",positive
"This switch is now located behind my entertainment center.  It handles the Xbox, satellite, blueray, desktop computer and a spare wire for a laptop. It does a great job and the price including shipping was better than the local shops.",positive
"An incredible product, currently running on a home linux network, works great and stays up and working for long, even for burning CD-ROMs through NFS... Great product!",positive
"I have been using these for a while and have had great luck.Pros:- Price- Great Lifetime Warranty- Fast gigabit unmanaged switch- Solid, heavy case.Cons- Non so far - I will follow up if I have any problems",positive
"Seems to me when a unmanaged desktop switch works well, it's just what you want. This is the case here. Speaking of case - this unit has a metal case which gives it a little heft. When you have a bunch of cables plugged in it has a better chance of staying in place and I think it is more durable.",positive
The switch allowed me to finish up my network within my home.  Takes up very little room and extremly easy to hook up.,positive
especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit,positive
high quality for a low price. I will not hesitate to buy it again if I need a 10 port switch.,positive
"I'm using this in my home theater to share an single ethernet connection between a DVR, DVD player, and a streaming video player.  It works well for this application.  In a dark room the blinking status lights can be annoying.  If the status lights could be disabled, I'd give it 5 stars (hint, hint, Netgear).",positive
"Fabulous! Worth every penny! I have my Blu-Ray, RUKO and Apple TV all connected and no loss of quality! Excellent!",positive
"Really good experience so far, have had it running 24/7 for ~3 months and has worked very well, can't complain.",positive
"these are the best there are, sturdy, simple and work every timei use mine to hardwire first floor of the house for blue rays, desktop and hookup location for work laptopthroughput is great and installation was extremely simplethis design did not change for last 20 years",positive
"This switch works like a charm.  Zero setup so it was an easy install.  I needed multiple network connections at my entertainment center (HDTV, BD, etc) and my broadband router is in an upstairs study.  Wireless just doesn't do it yet for streaming movies, plus I did not want to buy a wireless adapter for each device.  This was a great investment.",positive
"Works perfectly with our office Wi-Fi system...great buy and not problems at all! I highly recommend it, Netgear is always a good quality buy.",positive
I had one ethernet internet cable coming in to my home theater but needed to hook up my DirectTv DVR and Samsung Blu Ray player.  Worked like a charm.  It has more slots than I needed but may hook the Wii console to the internet some day.....if I figure out why!  Good product and with the $10 rebate it was a very cheap solution to my problem.,positive
"My old hub died after six years of use, so I bought this to replace it.  It was brain-dead simple to install and it works great.",positive
Switch works without any issues.--- -- --- --- --- ---- --- --- --- ---- ----- ----- ---- --- ---,positive
I installed one of these on each of the two desks that me and my wife have in our home.  Now we can plug into the network with a 3' cable and we are off and running,positive
"Granted a wireless switch is not the most complex of all product purchases, I was more than happy with the setup. Unwrap, plug-in to your existing network and you're in business.",positive
It worked as soon as I plugged in the switch off the router.  Each device I plugged into the switch connected right away.,positive
"The package arrives neatly packaged and properly secured. The packaging is easy to open and everything needed is included except for an ethernet cable, but you should have 1 or 2 of these laying around already.Installation is super easy, just plug in the power connector and plug in your in and out ethernet connections and you're done.Construction is very solid and I can see this box lasting almost forever unless you drop it from a 20 story building.",positive
What can I say? It does what it should - It's Netgear! We have never had any problems with netgear products and for $8 who could pass this up?,positive
"Plug it in and it works - why can't they make all computer devices this simple?  No setup, no muss, you've already got about 50 of the cables you need from old devices.  Nothing could be better.",positive
"Works like a charm, no issues no concerns, no problems. Used the in cascades with ~70 machines.  Tried it for many months now.",positive
A nice looking product in a metal case.  I plugged in the cables and the power supply and it worked.  End of story.  What more could one want in a switch at a good price.,positive
"Easy to plug in, works exactly as it's supposed to, the price is right. Don't forget to have extra Cat5 cables around to plug into your router. Better yet, pick up some using Amazon's &#34;add-on&#34; program with the low, low prices and free shipping.",positive
"Seems to help the speed and visuals appear faster. No problems with it, would purchase again. Keep in mind this is a switch, not a modem.",positive
"Installed this switch to serve a printer and desktop PC. It's been rock solid so far. The printer would not hold a reliable wireless connections, so I opted to use its ethernet port.",positive
For me this was very simple to install and set up.  Basically just plug it in and plug in the Ethernet cables and it worked.  There was no software that had to be installed and so it was about as simple as it gets for me at least.,positive
"I have owned these for roughly a couple of weeks, but i have never had any issues with any other Netgear switches that I have bought in the past.",positive
I bought this little switch to run either my BluRay player or my Logitech Review from one ethernet cable which runs from my router.  Build quality is good and it works great.  I would recommend it.,positive
"The reason that I purchased the device is because I ran out of ports on my router. I need two devices to share a port on the router at different times of the day. I didn't know if it would works, but it works great. For $19.99, one can't go wrong. JMC",positive
"I do a lot of networking with other businesses (Linksys and belkin) love the Linksys and the belkin both.I am very happy with this switch, it workes great without problems (sofar), connects easely and smoothly with-out trouble.I love this switch.It says, connect and use, I just connected all the cables, with in seconds, it was working GREAT with no problems.I recomend this to anyone.If anything goes wrong, I will update.(Bought at staples)(I am using my moms account)",positive
"Nice little switch box that works exactly like it should. I unboxed it, mounted it on a wall, plugged it in and it was good to go. Better built and half the size of the D Link switch it replaced. I really like the fact that it has a metal housing and not cheap plastic. If you need a well built an inexpensive switch I highly recommend this one.",positive
"Its tough, its reliable, no configuration necessary.Well suited for home or industrial use.I've bought many of these over the years for myself and for clients; I've never had one go bad and the quality has maintained itself over the years.  Fantastic product.",positive
"Owned it for over a year, works without flaws. Simply plug in your stuff and it works. If you're looking for a ethernet switch, then you've found it.",positive
"good buy, good product.  works great for exactly what we needed. no problems so far & the reviews were good.",positive
Simple and effective.,positive
"Netgear products have always been my first choice in home interconnection.  I've found Netgear products to be reliable and full featured, quite frequently having more of the needed and hand features that their competitors offer.This device was needed to expand the port availability to my curent system to allow addition fo internet linkage for a newly installed solar array system to my house.  The divice works well and meets my needs.",positive
"Works great in my entertainment center. Have a lot of devices these days that connect to the internet, and decided to cut down on the wifi in the house. This guy works great with all the devices, no hassle, easy install.",positive
"Perfect cheap switch when you just want to plug it in and not have to worry about configuring a device. This is not a managed switch but why pay extra unless you absolutely need management capabilities, this is a perfect buy if you're looking for a unmanaged switch to just connect a couple of devices off one Ethernet port.",positive
"Seems rare for any networking device to simply work right out of the box, but this one did. I bought another one I liked it so much.",positive
I purchased this unit for my home network about 2 years agoand it is still working great! Network traffic progresses smoothlyeven at 4 seperate stations and has a great value for the money.,positive
"Competent switch. Netgear seems to be like Cisco's cousin when it comes to at least home routers, where Cisco's business/enterprise routers/switches are sworn by, I can say the same for Netgear at the home level. Very good switch, I have my computer + printer plugged into it (far away from the router, it's in another room) perfect throughput, everything is great. Printed through it from another computer on the network multiple times.",positive
"This worked flawlessly with a Powerline adapter then splitting out the connection to a PS3, Logitech Revue and Mini-Mac.  None of the downstream components had any issues receiving or sending data through this device.  Highly recommended for a cost effective solution outside of using Wireless",positive
"fast shipping, great great price. This Netgear switch works exactly as described. Integrated into my home network with ease. I'm using this with several Apple items. My signal chain is:-cable modem> Apple Extreme Base Station (wifi)> NETGEAR Switch> x-Box 360, WII, Mac Mini, Apple TV. All of my devices get internet and the speeds seem to have increased across the board.Small compact size does not take up a lot of room. Happy with the purchase.",positive
"I'm using this to subdivide a network and it works perfectly. No setup, just plug and play. I really like the Netgear brand of products, all I've used have been very good. I plan to replace some LinkSys router/switches with these the next time they fail.",positive
"This switch is basic and it works just fine, it is a great value for the price that I paid.",neutral
Great switch for small jobs.  I've been using it for years & I haven't had a single problem with it.,positive
"Netgear has a good reputation and history of making quality products and this is no exception. It is easy to see that they did not sacrifice quality at the cost of making a low price product. It is a simple low end switch, so don't look for features that is not what it was designed for and where the cost savings comes from.",positive
I use these as temporary network expanders in conference rooms or hotels. They work well and the price is good.,positive
Just plug it in and it works perfect.  Your router will assign an IP automatically and your are off and running.  No software to install or anything.  BAM... done.,positive
"Great price with rebate.  Installed fine and got my DVR, Blu Ray and TV all on the internet at once  Small box that is easily hidden and can be wall mounted though I have not done that.",positive
"As with all ethernet switches it should be pretty straight foward to plug in and connected. This is the second one I've used. The first one has been up and running on my work network 24/7 for over 2 years with no issues. This one I hooked up on my home network, and worked as expected found connections and I was up and runnning as fast as I could hook up the cables!",positive
I Have many of Netgear's switches. They have all working been well for a long time. Slightly more expensive than some brands but worth it.,positive
"Having used ethernet for a number of years, I have accumulated a collection of switches and routers.  Since they are such simple devices, I was surprised to learn that they do break/burn out. After testing my old devices, I purchased two of these Netgear switches to handle the array of ethernet connections now required for the current home entertainment systems.  So far, so good.",positive
"Hook up was a breeze, does what it is supposed to. I use the additional connection for my web based garage door openers. Cannot comment if there is decay in data transfer.",positive
"I have two.  Chose them over flimsier-looking plastic switches and it seems to have been a solid choice.  They do what they're supposed to, which in my case is to double the ethernet feed to hard-wire my two pairs of Dish boxes and BluRay players.",positive
Don't know what to say.  It does what it claims to do.  Doesn't toast my grill cheese sandwiches or change my oil but does add ethernet ports.sss,neutral
"This was just what I was looking for.  It networks my pc's perfectly and can now share printers, etc. without dropping out of the connection.  Sturdy construction.  Great price.",positive
"I use this small switch to share the single Ethernet port on my living room to all TV stand devices. I left it always on for the last 6 months and it never gave any problem or had to be reset. Highly recommended.With the rebate, it turns to be one of the cheapest small switch available, but still it looks great quality.",positive
"Needed to add ethernet ports to my home PC installation, but had no spare ports on the Linksys router.This Netgear box solved that problem quickly and with minimal installation hassle.",positive
"well, being a simple switch, there is not much to say about: looks and feels well built, Works just fine. does not warm up... very nice product. will buy again",positive
"I buy this product because I trust Netgear, When I open the package,it is a solid product, works very well , I like it.",positive
"If you want a good solid low cost switch this is it.  I've installed dozens of these and they've proved to be quite reliable.  The housing is metal, not some cheap plastic and the switch works well.",positive
"Netgear is dependable, and well-worth the money.  I use these network switches in many different applications at work, and I've never had a problem with any of them.  If you're lucky enough to catch them with a rebate offer, just remember they limit you to two of any single model.",positive
Adds more Ethernet ports just fine. Easy set up and no problems. Metal case and well made. I would recommend this product,positive
Nicely built Desktop Switch Box.  Actually mad out of metal instead of plastic.  Allows needed room to expand any of your Ethernet cable components.,positive
It's Netgear so it's gotta be good!  Just plug it in and go--no need to fool around with some brand X product when you can get the good stuff for so little money.,positive
This solved my problem for needing additional ports.  I was going to buy another router with additional ports but while researching the routers I found this switch.  You just plug it in and instantly have more ports.  Much cheaper than buying another router! So far it has been great and I am sure I will never need more ports than this switch provides.,positive
"I've been using some version of this little switch at work and at home for the past several years.  They're not fancy, or the fastest switch in the world.  But they're solid, handy, small, inexpensive, and they just work.  As an IT guy, I view it like I view a power strip.  Always good to have a spare.",positive
"I've had this for a few months now and it still works perfect.  I'd have no reason to think why it would not continue to function perfectly.  It is built nice and solid.  It was $19.95 I believe, with a $10 rebate which I received right away.  If you need a simple switch for your home office, look no further.",positive
Not too much to say about these units other than they work really well.  Very affordable and well built - the only switch I buy when I need these for clients.,positive
"I purchased this switch to be able to connect two computers to one home run on my wired network, no problems and works reall good.",positive
Needed some additional ports from an outlet and it solved the issue with no wiring.  Works great right out of the box.,neutral
This network switch from Netgear has a small footprint and is easy to hook and use.  I'm using this in my home theater to connect several internet capable devices to the single ethernet drop I have in that location and the switch has been working flawlessly for that purpose.,positive
"Simple. Simple. Simple. Fantastic! This device is exactly what it says it is: an ethernet switch.I ran out of ports on my router and needed something simple to expand - this is it. Fantastic. Is very fast, no gimmicks or nonsense. Plug it in, plug into router and you have four additional ports ready to work flawlessly at lightening speed.I would buy this again!!",positive
It does tend to bottleneck your internet connection so that is a point of concern if you work for a large company. I bought it since our office only has one computer internet outlet in the charting area and I needed to hook up a second computer.,positive
"This item worked just fine it came ready to go, it was well packaged with instructions, it did the job I had hoped for, I had a blind spot in my home wifi system so with this I was able to run the cable and provide internet to a part of the house known as the dead zone.",positive
"More of a commodity purchase I bought not for a specific purchase, but more to grab and use when needed.  Netgear makes great products and I've never had problems with any of their switches.  Be sure to note this is not a 10/100/1000 switch, but it is reflected in the price.",positive
"Added a second computer to our HDHomerun Media Center in the Den, and this made it easy.  It took 20 minutes from the time I started hooking up the Netgear ProSafe until it was complete.  Both computers were already up and running before I started.  One was on a cat5 cable and the other one on a USB WiFi stick.  Now they are both hard wired to the router using this switch.",positive
"Plugged it in, it worked fine, and it continues to work. If you just need a few more 10/100 Mb/s RJ-45 Ethernet outlets, this little box will do the job. Nice solid metal box.",positive
I've had this on 24/7 for the past month or two and it seems to work ok.  It acts as a subnet with 2 computers on it.  It then hooks into another switch that is configurable but two computers use one port into it.,positive
"I have always liked the Netgear switches. Solid, reliable, and well priced. I needed something at the end of a long run to add another component vs. home-running another CAT5e cable back to the main switch. Works just fine. Auto-negotiates appropriately and no issues pegging it at 100Mbps throughput.",positive
"What can I say, this little box is plug and play. I was out of ethernet ports so needed a switch, two years ago and it still works great.",positive
Bought this 5 port ethernet switch after hearing it's iffy on whether it would work.  Well I'm glad to say it definitely does!  Didn't even feel any delays on Slingbox or Netflix movie streaming.,positive
"Solid switch.  Works with my llinux-based computer where one of those green switches didn't.  I read that the power connector was short and would disconnect.  I find no truth to that though I'm not yanking on it all the time.  Also, doesn't feel hot at all which is something else that I've read about this switch,",positive
"I have used literally hundreds of little 5/8 port switches.  I prefer the Netgear ProSafe switches for their solid construction and good power supplies.  While they may not necessarily be the cheapest switch out there, they have been solid in every environment I have put them in.  Enclosed in higher temp cabinets to under a desk they always perform perfectly without a problem.",positive
"I got sick and tired of the flaky wireless connection for my PS3 and Xbox 360. I don't have a hardwire ethernet connection in the game room so I bought an Actiontec Powerlink ethernet connection twin pack..(runs ethernet over your home's power lines). Anyway...I have a power link module, PS3, and Xbox360 connected to the Netgear FS105 Switch and everything works perfectly.",positive
"Heavy, requires external power source, runs a bit hot - but gets the job done.",positive
"This stopped my problem with my wireless router kicking my hard wired connection.I had to restart both routers often.Now I have a dedicated wire to 2 bedrooms, AT&T; Micro-cell and wireless router!Better than I thought, haven't been kicked since I hooked it up.The 5 ports consists of 1 input and 4 output.I'm very pleased with this switch and highly recommend it.",positive
"I have had this switch for many years, and recently it has been cutting out.  I have a desktop PC, PS3, Xbox 360, and Samsung HDTV connected to it now, and often when I turn my computer off then back on, the switch does not work until I unplug it and plug it back in.I realize the device is positively ancient, but this should not happen.",negative
"I bought this to direct wire my NetFlix / Blu-Ray player.  Ran the ethernet from the other side of the house, plugged it in and forgot about it.  No issues to date",positive
"It lasted only 2 months, that's pretty bad for a Router/switch. See if i can get a refund for it. My D-link lasted 5 yrs.",negative
"I misunderstood what it was. I needed a wired router and actually don't know what this is for, although I looked it up. My mistake.",negative
Needed to add some more drops at home & this switch was totaly painless. Plug it in & your done.,positive
"Worked great right out of the box. This is the kind of quality that I expect from Netgear. Now if they can figure out a way to eleminate the ""wall wart"".",positive
The Netgear FS105 is a great 5-port Ethernet Switch (housed in a nice metal case).  You simply plug it in and it works.  Got it for $15 (after the $10 mail-in rebate).  Highly recommended.,positive
"This is a great switch.The offer says $10. rebate.Be ware... this is a $10 prepaid debit card good on the purchase of another Netgear unit, no $10 cash.",positive
This product does exactly what I wanted it to do. I plugged in the ethernet cables and it worked great from there. Netgear is a great product.,positive
It is a computer ethernet desktop switch that promises what it says it will deliver.  The cost seemed very fair also.,positive
"What else can I really say? Inexpensive 5 port switch, it's exactly what I wanted. Now I don't have to deal with wifi dropping in my apartment every once in a while.",positive
"Needed this to complete the integrated wiring in my house. I simply plugged everything in, and now I have live ethernet jacks in all my bedrooms. Great stuff and a perfect little device with no hassle set-up. It's just a switch, so it's not like there's much to go wrong, but you can be confident this one works!",positive
"Switches all eventually burn-out, especially the cheap ones.  This is an older 10/100 model, which is plenty fast for home/small-office use, and should give you a good 5+ years of use.",positive
"I love these particular models. They work great. They are well made.I have owned several netgear products and these are my favorite. If you want a router or a switch that will last, look to these first.They are super affordable to boot!",positive
Works just fine for me - no problems at all. Good quality metal casing is better than some of the cheaper plastic hubs.,positive
Good stable cheap switch. It's a great durable little switch that works perfectly for the home office or small office that doesn't need a lot of ports or a managed switch.,positive
We use a number of these cost effective switches in a variety of applications. Great for multiple computers in the same area. Great price point too. NETGEAR is always a good buy. Very simple install-couldn't be easier.,positive
"Rather than buy separate powerline adaptors for devices that are right next to each other, I used this small switch. A+ on the durable metal construction... I expect years of loyal service from this device. I will rate it 5 stars once I receive my mail-in rebate.",positive
"I needed to share an Internet connection between a network drive and a computer and this switch did the trick. Nothing to install - just plug and go, could not have been easier. And the footprint is nice and small. Finally, performance rocks - throughput is very fast.",positive
"the less there is to say about a switch the better. Thus, i'll just say that the build quality is solid, metal not plastic, and i've yet to have a problem.",positive
"We recently changed to a fiber optic internet provider and wished to hook both of our computers up to it.  This tiny little box does a great job.  We used Cat5e patch cables to connect the computers to the switch.  The set up was simple and quick, and we've had no problems so far.",positive
I'm not hiding that I like Netgear products for entry level use. This device has a 5th port that you can use in uplink or normal mode. It is very compact with indicator lights for connection and collisions. It is also very reliable.,positive
"Nice small switch, works immediately after plugging. Plugged it to a DLink router to split internet connection and feed all my PCs; works great.",positive
If you need extra ports for you network these work great and are ruggedly built. The metal case should take a beating and aid in cooling.,positive
"Works perfectly.I wish it were faster, but for the money, I couldn't ask for more.  I has never failed me.",positive
"Desired a small switch to share a single ethernet connection to multiple items in my entertainment center (TV, BluRay, Sat TV box etc).  This is a nice compact switch that easily mounted on the back of the cabinet and allowed the single internet cat5 cable running in the wall to my router, to be shared on multiple devices.  Plugged in power, line to network and then to devices all was needed.",positive
This switch is still working after more than a year; and is mounted in a hot/humid hallway with 90f temperatures all summer. I paid $19.99 including shipping and used a $10 rebate... Worth it :),positive
So far this appears to be holding up and working good. It is made in china and the first type I bought that was made in china crapped out after a month. So far this one is working.,positive
I've had this for almost a year now and it is still going strong.  There's not much to say about it: plug in your cables and go.  Doesn't require a whole lot of set up.  It's also low-profile and feels like solid make.  Very happy with this purchase.,positive
This device does exactly what it's supposed to.  I have a few of them around the office and they've held up to a few years of use already.,positive
"This is a splitter so that you can have multiple ethernet ports plugged in and don't need a router. This works wonderfully, even if you have a router and still need more ports. This is a compact device as well and the only mildly inconvenience is that it needs to be plugged in to a power outlet.",positive
"Needed extra Ethernet ports and this did just what I wanted. Plugged everything in , connected it to my router and everything worked fine.",positive
"To this very day, Nancy has never let me down and for that she received the glorious fiver.If you don't own her already, do it. She is like no woman on earth.",positive
This is very easy to use just plug in the things you need and plug in the power and away it goes. No problems over the more than two years it has been used.,positive
"Works as advertised, plug and play. I will say it survived the drop test, accidentally dropped it about 3 feet onto concrete floor and works fine. Why get a half duplex hub when you can have the full duplex switch? After rebate this was $[...], can't beat that.",positive
"This economical little box replaced another which didn't work well. I won't name the other brand, but this is clearly superior in quality, performance, and sturdiness. I attached this to a wall in the closet which has become devoted to internet communications within my home. Netgear will be my first brand choice for the next network replacement.",positive
Works well and is an easy way of multiplying access into your network to avoid having to re-run wiring of home runs to the switch.,positive
ok,positive
"Typical Netgear....high quality, easy setup, competitively priced. I've been using Netgear products for 8+ years & will continue to do so.",positive
You need one router on a home network. The modem plugs into it. The router provides DHCP to assign NAT addresses. A switch has two uses:.. If you need more jacks than your router provides... If you have a long ethernet cable to another room where you need more than oneconnection... In an office that has one jack and you need more than one.,positive
"Came on time and works as expected. Nice product, Good service. Device has some decent weight to it so that it wont move around easily when stationed.",positive
"10/100 Ethernet switching How can you go wrong?  Until the recent demise of the networking industry, I worked for Bay Networks/Nortel Networks and remember raving about 10/100 switches when they dropped to the unheard of price!  Wow.  An Ethernet switch in my home office.",positive
Worked for a few days then died.  I think the power supply was the weak link.  Should be a highly reliable product - I am surprised.,negative
"Nice price, fast shipping and works just like it is supposed to, used to connect multiple pc's in a conference room.",positive
Plug and play . . . . .literally.  Super-easy to install and plays well with other network equipment.  Liked it so much I bought it's bigger brother too.,positive
Netgear has always produced excellent and reliable products ... this little switch is no exception.  A high quality heavy duty metal case - unlike most of the competition's plastic cases.,positive
"This is awesome, especially for the cost.  Just plug and play.  I have 5 port modem/switch from Verizon for my internet and needed more lines hooked up in my house then just the 5.  So took this, plugged into the modem/switch and bang, 4 more ports, nothing else to do.  If you need to expand your wired device this is a great addition.  Just plug it in and your all set to go.",positive
"this item does exactly what it is meant to do and it is very easy to work with, even for people like me who do not know much about computers",positive
"Got this little switch to go in my living room so I could connect my AV Receiver, PS3, and Directv DVR. Setup is a no brainer and the quality of this little unit is superb!",positive
"I've been using Netgear products for years, both for business and home.  I've never been disapointed in any of their products.  I purchased this switch to replace a older/cheaper one that worked about half the time.  Using for smart TV and computer internet in residential garage (man cave).",positive
It works. I keep a couple in stock when my customers routers use up their router ports.It looks solid and so far performs the same way.,positive
"Easy set up , just connect power cord , plug all ethernet cable that you need for maxium 4 port , wait until all green light turn on , you are done , especially work for slingbox without firewall blocking",positive
"Junk, Only one ethernet port worked.  Tech support sucked.  Will stay away from net gear.  Purchased a china model for 10.00 cheaper and it works great.",negative
"This switch allowed me to hard wire in my entertainment center with only one data jack available.  I can know plug in my surround sound, blu ray, cable box, apple tv and tv.  The all now have a hard line, faster downloads.",positive
The switch has worked flawlessly since day one.  The metal case is a nice touch as it is being used in a classroom environment -- the sturdier the better for me.,positive
"Ridiculously easy to set up. LIghtweight, but with sturdy construction. I like having the lights and inputs on the same side. Rebate offer made this a very sweet deal, indeed!",positive
"Its a box of magic and it works, real simple to hook up ! no brainier for about anyone. Great price",positive
"I had an older version of this that is at least 10 years old. I have an Xbox 360, Xbox 1, and PS3 all in one room with one outlet. This did the trick. Install was straight forward.",positive
"I had one Ethernet port and two devices. What to do... Oh I got it, get a switch. Why choose this switch you ask. Cause I had another one for a similar dilemma and it works. That one has worked for years keeping my xbox and bluray happy. Now I expect the same from this one for my PC and VOIP. Way to go Layer Two device!",positive
This has been a great switch. Got a good deal on this one when the newer model came out.,positive
"This thing works like a champ. The metal construction is far superior to all the plastic competition, IMO. I recommend this exact model to all that ask me.",positive
"Nice competitive price.  No problem at all installing or using it.  It does exactly what it claims.  Also, it's very compact, sizewise.",positive
"I purchased this switch to expand my network.  I have owned one of these Netgear 5 port switches for a few years and have never had a problem, so, this purchase was a no brainer.  This one has been in service for a week with no issues.",positive
"I would buy it again, does the job and is a good value for the quality you get. wish i had bought it sooner.",positive
"I'll summarize the performance in one word: delightful.If you need Gigabit speeds, search for a different product. Personally, I'm using these NetGear switches with Asoka PlugLink 9650s and I couldn't be much happier. A couple of these switches and a HomePlug system is sweet! Now, I'll just have to wait for HomePlug AV2 equipment with Gigabit speeds so I can buy newer, faster switches ... ;)",positive
I've probably used 20.They rarely fail (in my experience).I really like the sturdy metal case and the auto up-link detection.,positive
"I got this as a switch for the other end of the house and the kids' video games and computers that weren't yet wireless.  It worked like a champ.  I was a former Linksys user, but have jumped ship and now use Netgear because of their reliability and support.",positive
great router got it in just a couple of days no going to best buy to get ripped off anymore,positive
I trust Netgear products. I had several Netgear products and everything works great. No complain at all. More devices I was able to connect with this switch and still get excellent Wi-Fi connection from my router.,positive
"I am not technical but this was easy to use, just plugged in LAN cable from router and into PC, DVD Player and TV.  Speed is good.",positive
"If you have much of a network in your home or office like me (14+ devices) you probably need an extra switch here or there.  I have one in my closet, one behind the television. and one behind the wall in the back room.  I also carry one around in my computer bag just in case.  Netgear makes good hardware.  I would buy again in a heartbeat if I needed another.",positive
I needed to add another computer to our LAN network at home.  I ordered this and it came as notified.  Getting it setup was easy and no problems.  I have had no problem with this switch and very happy with the performance.  I now have four computers on the LAN and this switch keeps on going.,positive
"Easy to setup and runs great.Got this to expand ethernet connection to my wireless router.  Hook up and plug in, runs flawlessly.  No software to install and no setting to choose.Only one thing potential buyers needs to be aware:  there are only 4 ports available for downstream connection.  You need use one to connect to your router, modem, or whatever gives you internet access.",positive
"This board is great.  Hotkeys, ergo, etc...I can't wait until you can buy different colored keys for each letter.Do use Windows without it!",positive
"I went from a microsoft natural keyboard elite to a pro, and it's a magnitude better.  The elite was mushy, the keys just didn't have any bounce.  The pro has more spring.  It doesn't have as much response as an IBM Model M keyboard, but this is so much better than the elite that it's general feel is great.I hope microsoft brings a keyboard like this one back into full production soon.",positive
"I have had this keyboard for over a year and have dumped several glasses of pop and water into it. It is still working fine and the USB hub is very convienient if you have a digital camera, or IPaq, etc. No problems whatsoever!",positive
"This keyboard is great.  The hot-buttons are addictive.  But, I would recommend spending the extra money to get the pro natural version.  Its worth the money for the extra hot buttons and USB hub.  Especially lately because everything you now buy is usb.",positive
"Although it is made of plastic, it works!.  I bought a second one.  What was missing was those donut disc that fit over the bulb to block rain from going into the socket.",positive
"Not the greatest, but after a month it is still working great. I wish it had more than 1,5 and 10 minutes light time though, but for $12 you can't really go wrong! I'm running the 23watt GE CFLs and it all works flawlessly.",positive
this is the worst light i have ever owned Never worked and when it did stay lit it would leave me in the dark. the only reason i did not return it was i needed it to pass an Electrical inspection,negative
"I purchased this product  based on other customer reviews and the price. Arrived on time, and it installed easily without any problem. I have had it for about 2 months now and it is still working great.Good product for the price!",positive
"This is about the best deal on outdoor lighting I have ever seen.  Easy to install, worked the first time.  yes, you do need to caulk around it to keep mosture from getting into the seam, but I do that with every outdoor project.",positive
"I read the reviews and quite frankly; I'm baffled. Though some of the reviews gave this light a bad review; I'm not. This is a great light, it picks up the slightest movement and that is EXACTLY what I needed. The span of it was surprisingly wide and on cue when tested. If you need a cheap but good light, this is it.",positive
I bought 2 and both stop working within 2 months. Moisture got into the cheap plastic sensor housing and shorted out. I should have spent the extra money and got a better built unit.,negative
"I mounted two of these on my deck and they work just fine although for just a little more money I could have ordered the SL-5411 that has a wider sensing range (150 degrees), is provided with more mounting options, and has lamp holders that are easier to adjust. The color of this fixture is more ivory and the SL-5411-WH-C was more white.",positive
"A good one of these can last 20 years. A bad one doesn't last 20 weeks. Either way, getting the whole fixture and chucking everything bar the sensor saves $10-15 over buying just the sensor. Crazy, landfill madness but what you gonna do.",neutral
Great for the price.  But very plastic.  It works and is up doing what it is suppose to do.  I wouldn't buy another.  I would pay more for an LED one now.,positive
The mounting holes of this light are 45 degrees off the vertical or horizontal axis of the holes on the electrical box. It is impossible to mount correctly without some unsightly drilling.,negative
Its a decent motion sensor that can be added to pretty much any light fixture with space to add it.,positive
"Its cheaper than buying a new light, and it works great! have not had an issue. Has good range, and only works at night, it that is what you want.",positive
"We'd had a sensor fail on an existing light and I ordered this to replace it.  The older unit was from a different manufacturer, but looked identical and carried the same model number.  Installation was straightforward--I simply removed the existing wire nuts, removed the old unit from the light housing, and reversed the process to install the new one.  It works dependably, as advertised.This was a much cheaper option than buying a new motion flood light fixture.",positive
Range said to be 70 feet but in reality it appears to be more like 25 feet.  Next time I will go with a new LED model.,negative
These replaced the sensors in my motion detector lights easily and worked perfectly. I was glad not to have to replace the entire lamp. Not exciting or inexpensive enough for five stars.,positive
I was glad to be able to just buy the sensor rather than replace the entire fixture.  It was an easy replacement (TURN THE BREAKER OFF FIRST).  The unit has sensitivity adjustment and instructions as to angle so you neighbor does not light your yard while getting his newspaper 600 feet away.  It has worked very reliable for several months in some nasty weather.,positive
"I bought one of these at Home Depot and it cost me twice as much as this on line purchase from Amazon.  When the perimeter lights fail, this is the gadget that dies.  If you are up to the job, just replace the sensor.  Everything is color coded.  What I did was build my own motion detected perimeter light set up using this for the sensor.  It cost me less than buying one as a unit.",positive
This device was a replacement for the exact same model. The old one didn't work and this one does as expected.,neutral
Had a pair of these for about 10 years and they still work. I am replacing 2 sensors that were burned during a storm and a surge.Cannot say anything bad about the Zenith sensors because they are (and have been) reliable for years.,positive
It was easy to replace the defective sensor. It has been in service for several months and comes on every time I expect it to be on.I have it on for 1-minute and it always goes off on time. The daylight sensor works as designed.,positive
This works great I wired it into the porch lights to turn on when someone is on the porch at night,positive
"I hacked this into a plain inexpensive porch light I got at OSH.Works well.  It does do a false trip when headlight from a car shines at it, which doesn't bother me.  If people are bothered by this, they shouldn't get in their cars.The photo cell is a nice feature, keeping the unit off during daylight hours.",positive
Replaces the old sensor for my outside garage driveway light.Could not get these here for some reason.Only expensive commercial versions.,positive
"I replaced my old outside motion sensor with this. It fit perfectly where the old one was, works great and looks good.",positive
"I haven't hooked it up yet, so can't really say a lot about it except it was a great price for what I wanted it for; lights & alarm.",positive
This is a great model for the price.  Amazon price is much better than most.  It has the minimal functional controls but more controls would mean a higer cost and more prone to failure.  Buy 2 because the things do not last for ever outside.,positive
I had ordered this along with two 10 watt led flood lights.  The lights came right away but waited over two weeks for the sensor.  So I purchased a  Heath/Zenith (different model) locally.  I wouldn't work.  This one finally arrived and it works great,positive
Bought as a replacement for an old unit that hung up at times (leaving the lights on after sunrise).  Despite some warnings it works well with a few watts of LED lamps for load.,positive
"Yes, it works, but the effective range is only about 1/3 of the advertised 70 feet, or about 23 feet!  The cost is small enough, but I'd rather pay more and get one that does the job.  I've found that all of these have a limited lifespan, anyway.  Can anyone tell me where I can get a decent motion detector?",negative
My review is targeted primarily at the previous purchase of the same item.  They seem to last about 6 to 9 months then the motion detection quits working.  I did try other brands but seems these type of devices have a limited life span.  I kept the old one for repurpose since the optical light sensor continues to work.,neutral
Had to replace the motion sensor on my old unit. Old unit was about 14 years old. Nice to still find this. HD and Lowes wants you to replace the whole unit.,positive
Though it is longer than I needed it works perfectly. No shorts or wire noise. Both ends seem well affixed to wire.,positive
"I needed to extend a phone in my apartment without having to drill holes in the wall. So, I decided to purchased this 25ft cable which arrived promptly. Unlike others on the market that are flimsy, this one is of good quality and works just as advertised.  I'd definitely recommend it to my friends or anyone who's looking for a phone extension.",positive
Simple extention cable I needed to run to get phone service to the other room in my house. Works as it should.,positive
I needed this wire to extend the phone wire to the jack and what a great job it did! It sounds like the jack is 2 feet away! No quality issues at all!,positive
"Dymo is probably the only product i'll ever use.The king of labels. You can't go wrong with the best.easy to load system, anyone can use it.",positive
"Dymo is a leader in label printers, I use them at work and at home.Tape is what they advertised.  WAAYYY TOO EXPENSIVE, but all label tape seems to be.",positive
"this is a good consumable product to make labels with, prints good and is sticky.a good value and works well with the rhino label maker I have",positive
I bought this in conjunction with the label maker for those special label making occasions. Works well and would purchase again.,positive
I mostly use this tape outdoors because this one does not seem to fade much outdoors and has great adhesive.  The other plastic tape I tried (black on white) doesn't seem to have good adhesive.,positive
"I personally don't see any problem with this product. It is easy to put in a new cartrige and to take on out. However the cartridges do seem a little expensive, but they last pretty long. I've never had one jam yet either.",positive
I got this as a refill for my labeler. This is the kind of tape I always buy. It works well and I also have it in other colors. They have a variety. Good price.,positive
Im using this to protect labelit is clearYou can put it above your already printed labelsThan you,positive
worked as intended and would buy again.  Had no issues with these at all and I like how there are multiple styles of labels to use.,positive
"I had the labelmaker and the &#34;paper&#34; labels. They washed right off of the kids lunch containers. When I bought the laminted ones, they are still on months later. They arrived in perfect condition and earlier than expected. Thank you.",positive
"I mean what can you really say about it.  Its labeling tape.  But looks good, very sticky, and definitely better then the paper kind.  The paper gets dirty quick, this plastic stays clean.....",positive
I purchased them when I purchased the label maker and they all came in the same package. I'm glad I did that now I have refills.,positive
I am not sure this is really 13 ft .. Fed well into the Dymo unit . Color good .Probably would not buy again though.,neutral
"This was $2 more at Office Max (with tax) and I would have to spend $ in gas to get there.  Got the same item for less and free delivery with Amazon Prime.  I use these labels on everything, including kegs of homebrew beer.  The labels stay on even if the keg sweats, but peel off when I need to refill the keg.",positive
These labels are ok. They stick to most surfaces as expected. I will probably buy again since I have the label machine but I wish they would stick to all surfaces.,positive
"Bought this for my DYMO label maker. The price is much cheap than at local office stores. The tape has split backing, which helps with aligning it.",positive
the product is exactly what I ordered and works with my label maker even though it is a older model,positive
I really love the Dymo label and they are 1/2 the price as through local merchants. You get two for the price of one!  A++,positive
I use this and the Black on White mostly and have never had any trouble with this product. It works in my DYMO and is cost effective.  Recommended.,positive
I bought the Dymo label maker a couple years ago and couldn't figure out why it would print only the bottom of each character.  I changed the batteries and checked to see that the labeling tape was in correctly without a change in the printing.  After reading some reviews I thought it was possible that my labeling tape was just bad -- ordered a new one -- and now have perfect little labels.,positive
"DYMO labelling tape for a DYMO label maker.  What could be simpler?  Fits properly, prints well and has plenty of tape.",positive
"Well, it's labeling tape. It works great and the backing material is split so it's easy to get it off.",positive
"Got it in a very timely manner.  Love being able to label various items, wish that it was dish washer resistant, or at least lasted longer from washing.",positive
"Easy to use, fast, really trasnparent and the ink doesn't smear or smudge in it. Easy to peel (fold it in half)",positive
"These are just what I was looking for and they work really well for labeling items. Mostly, they're durable and don't seem to fade over time as others do. Try them, I think that you'll  like  them.",positive
My label maker ran out ions ago and had been sitting in a drawer in my desk. I discovered it again and looked on amazon for replacement label tape. Great price and shipped quickly.,positive
It is the only label tape we order and use.  It is always a great product so we highly recommend for use,positive
"My Girl has a label machine, and loves using it.  these are quality replacement rolls. I would recommend to anyone.",positive
"I use labels on nearly everything to keep myself organized. The clear ones are for items that a colored label would stick out on and I don't want it to. These are on mostly clear boxes that I still need to see through without the labels getting in the way. I have most of the colors on these, but I seem to use the clear a lot more than others.",positive
I have the DYMO Letra Tag Label maker and I love it. I have one at work and one at home. Excellent purchase for being the organized person that I am.,positive
"I purchased this here on Amazon becuase of the ease of ordering and price, both of which are great. This tape is also great - sticks to various surfaces, even some rough surfaces (have hammered finish cabinets that they stuck to). Recommended for your DYMO label maker!",positive
Fits the label printer well and labels print and stick well to a variety of surfaces.  Good price point to always have extra rolls on hand.,positive
"I really can't live without my Letra-Tag; I use it for absolutely everything. In addition, it is very affordable. it's the greatest!",positive
this is dymo labeling tape as described. it seems to work just fine. I would buy this dymo labeling tape again.,positive
"I use them to label my spray bottles,boxes and many others things and they have yet to fall off. Perfect so far and only $5 &change,I first started using the paper labels on my collectible magazine/comics & I was so impressed after 8/10 years they have yet to peel off.I only which the rolls would  be longer maybe 18/20 feet.",positive
"Remember the old, stiff plastic labels that were embossed by the label making machine? These are nothing like those! The labels produced with this tape are nice and thin and look professional.",positive
I like this tape to use for items that are easy to recognize across the way. Not quite as bright as it could be still better than standard white.,positive
I am a label freak. these are the plastic ones. black lettering on white background. they resist moisture. use this when you need moisture protection.,positive
This label reel fits exactly into our Dymo label maker. I highly recommend this item. It is a direct manufacturer's replacement.,positive
better than the solid white ones. and it prints better and adheres to surfaces better as well.  if it doesnt print well its usually your batteries are weak sauce,positive
Product was as offered. Speedy delivery. These label cartrages work perfect in my DYMO Lectratag label gun. Great product for the price. Would highly recommend this product to a friend.,positive
"These labels are extremely useful and durable, the only drawback is length of tape when you're working on printing out quite a few labels.I label everything that needs it in my reference guides, so I run out often during my studies..The Quality and Adhesive is top notch!I would recommend this product to anyone looking for labeling ideas.Hope that helps you with your purchasing decisionThanks for Reading!",positive
It is what it is what can i say they work. The only brand that will workin the label-er.,positive
"You put it into the machine, type and print a label and it prints what you type . No big deal.",neutral
The labeling tape was just like the others I have used.  Needed it for a school project and it was perfect!,positive
"While Label maker from Dymo is frustrating, far from my satisfaction as it ceased working as soon as arrived, this tape works well with other label maker I'm current using.",positive
Great product.  Worked great for my scrapbook project.  Wish I could have afforded more.  There needs to be a sale and less on the shipping.,positive
"These are the same carded Dymo white plastic refill tapes that you buy at the stores, for a lot less money.",positive
Working on a Living Trust estate binder and the label maker will in handy making tab labels.  Will provide update as I progress in this project.,positive

"I have a cable system that has an A-B switch.  Tivo does not support this.  Their solution is to decide between using Tivo on &quot;A&quot; or  &quot;B&quot;.  And when I wanted to switch, it took a 2 hour set up.  Also, if your system requires a cable box you probably wont be able to  watch another channel while Tivo is recording. (you would need another  cable box or cable tuner of some sort)",negative
"I've owned my Tivo for a month now and couldn't imagine not having it!  I've completely stopped using my VCRs to record TV.  In the past month, I've change my cable service over to digital and reconfiguring the Tivo  system was a snap.  This is the best electronics purchase I've ever made...",positive
"Don't think of it as a VCR, think of it as a personal broadcast network that only broadcasts the shows you like, only when you want, and without commercials.I've had one since June and it's rendered every other TV in  the house obsolete.With TiVo's current $50 off recommendation from  existing TiVo owners through November, it's an especially good bargain.",positive
Any Tivo is a huge improvement over regular television.This unit can easily be upgraded for more capacity.  I added an additional 80 gig drive without a hitch.Pausing live television is great.  I haven't used my VCR in over a year.  Tapes are a joke in comparison.Easy onscreen menus guide the set up of recording preferences.The Season Pass feature will record every episode for you!,positive
Not sure what all the extra padding is for. The case is huge compared to other 5 port 10/100 switches. It works as designed but I wouldnt recommend it over any other 10/100 out there,neutral
"This has been my secound experience setting up a small home network.  The first involved an SMC router.  The Linksys documention and overall user experience (setup guide, admin screens, and so forth) put the SMC materials to shame-- really it's night and day.  Both routers seem to work fine (though the SMC unit conked out on me; I think this was a fluke.)  But the Linksys' usability wins hands-down.  Highly recommended.",positive

"I needed an additional hub or switch to run from my Wireless DSL/Cable Router (which only had 1 PC/Uplink Port).  This switch worked great, and seemed to be priced comparable to many hubs, which would have worked fine for me, but obviously not given the benefits of the switch.If you need to add a few more computers to your existing network, this product is great.",positive
"I bought this router to split the connection in my room so I could connect to my XBOX and my computer at once, and its working perfectly so far.",positive
"I had no idea what this is/was,, but I bought it.  It works!Good price, excellent service(delivery).",positive
"Within a month of purchase, 2 of the 5 channels on this switch were dead.  This is unacceptable quality control on such a simple device.",negative
"Bought this switch to connect a couple of PCs and a wireless access point to my router/modem. Performs exactly as a switch should, in a small package, and for a reasonable price.",positive
"I bought this for use in a dorm room, where I needed to turn one port into multiple ones (For PC, Xbox 360, etc). This switch works great. I plugged it in and it worked right away. I have recommended this product to several friends.",positive
"I replaced an old hub on my home network with this.  I was getting an lot of ""collisions"" and slow performance.  This unit cleared that up.  Can't beat the price!",positive
"I pulled it out of the box & plugged it into a router port and added my two printers... didn't even have to configure the one printer, easy ""add device"" for the other printer. Switches are tiny now and it was so easy. It's hidden and I don't plan on touching it for years. The specialty router costs $200 and a port went bad. $22 is a lot cheaper. Thank you for extending the ports.",positive
Was adding a network printer and needed more connectivity.  Prior experience with Linksys gear influenced the decision.  The switch is compact and does all that was expected.,positive
"this was a quick, easy way to give me the extra slots on my network I needed. It was as easy as plugging it in and connecting to the existing router, and then hooking up whatever devices I needed to add to it. Works great!",positive
"Installation was a snap! I wanted to connect a couple of things to the internet in my living room, so I bought this switch. Plugged in my DVR receiver, a PS3, and and IPTV STB all to it. No set-up or configuring at all. Just plugged in and boom, instant internet to everything.",positive
Worked great no problem did the job it was need for. Can't say much else. I have no dislikes about it.,positive
"With this device I can connect my pc and xbox 360 at the same time.  I was able to purchase this for less than $20 dollars.  The speed on gaming is better then with my previous device.  All-in-all, one of the better investments I've made!",positive

"I already had one of these behind a Netgear router and recently added a second to accommodate some gaming systems and a new PC. The older switch is over a year old and has held up wonderfully with moves, a few drops on the floor, and signal drops from the cable modem in front of everything. No issues, great product and I would definitely recommend, all at a great low price too!",positive
"Works fine when I bought it, Covers the whole house all 2000 sq ft. Finally died after several years. Bought a Cisco Valefolus to replace it",positive
"I loved the easy, no hassle set up and agree with the favorable reviews on this switch. One warning note though: if you connect the switch to the internet through a router you only have 4 usable ports, not 5. One of the 5 will be empty but not usable. Not a problem for me and I put some tape over the unusable port to avoid confusion. (It's the one next to your ethernet connection.)",positive
"This little switch is a great buy for the money, a lot of features in a little package. If you need 4 more ports, this is a great buy!",positive
"I bought this when my Network Router went on the blink.  Since I had a DSL Modem with a firewall, I didn't need another router and this product allowed me to connect 5 computers to the switch.  Installation took about 5 minutes and I noticed an increase in speed right away.  I recommend this product to someone that doesn't need a firewall.",positive

Using this for my home network of 3 100 Mbps LinkSys in Win98 machines plus a 10 Mbps Linux machine. Works fine. There is no software driver required for this (drivers are required and supplied with the NIC cards that go in your machine). Looks really cute sitting on the shelf with the blinking LEDs!  Hope to use it when eventually get DSL or cable internet access out here.,positive

"I plugged in my workgroup switch, and then plugged in my PS-3, my Dell gaming computer, and my Dell laptop and everything worked just right. Hard to improve on this thing for trouble free installation and operation, and the previous reviews were what guided me to select it.",positive
I use dozens of these at my work when there is just one wall jack and I need to connect several pieces of equipment.  Note: this is just a dumb switch and NOT a router.,positive
"Works as described and no complaints.  I am using this for my TV, blu ray player, and xbox off of my Linksys router. Just make sure you hook everything up in the right order according to the directions on the cd and you will have no problems.  I would recommend Linksys to anyone.",positive
The employee it was ordered for has been using it for awhile.  Seems to be working great.,positive
"I used this switch to simply add internet conncection to my xbox alongside my PC.I live in a college dorm with only one ethernet wall jack for my use, so I bought this switch and it works just fine. Excellent speed and overall perfomance.",positive
This product came in early and only took me a few minutes to set up and begin using!  My wife notices the speed of using this over the wireless in our home (Uverse WiFI) so she is very happy.  Will do business with this seller again!  Thanks.,positive

"Installation and network set-up was a snap.  The fifth port is really the upstream connection.  So you get four clients, not five.",positive
Cisco makes networking easy because their products just work right out of the box.  I got exactly that with this switch which allowed me to plug in several networking devices with one ethernet source.  I have this dasiy-chained to the big 16-port hub and everything works like a dream with issues and no set-up time at all.,positive
"This product has served me just fine. I have experienced no problems with this switch, and I am certainly glad that I got this because I have a computer on 10Mb (instead of 100Mb), and I would not want that one computer to slow all the others down. It seems a little overpriced for what it does, but as a product, its performance has been optimal.",positive
"Works great,good coverage. Had a small problem setting it due to changeing my ISP from cable to DSL. Called tech support, and they walked me through the set up and even help with setting up my laptop.It's been two months since installation without any problems whatsoever.",positive
Running out of ports since I like wired wherever I can for better connectivity. Worked exactly as I needed and gave me 5 additional ports,positive
Great price and it does what a hub should do.  I have had multiple versions of this switch and all work well with my home networking needs for Netflix and Slingbox.  I recommend it.,positive
This product performs as described. I have no complaints. I bought it to use multiple computers from my internet connection using wired connections. So far it's worked flawlessly.,positive
This is the worst router that I have ever had.  Continues to drop like crazy even with latest firmware from Linksys.  I ended up to throw it aside.,negative
What else do you need to know? You plug in your PCs and a cable to your router - and go. I used a Netgear hub for years. Replaced it with this Linksys switch and my network speed improved immediately.,positive
"This is a simple commodity product that works fine. Tiny complaint is that the cables come out of the front of the box, would be better if they attached at the back.",positive
This Linksys switch does what it's supposed to do. I was able to connect all 3 computers to it and had no issues with operating all 3 at the same time. I trust Linksys's products,positive
"The Linksys EZXS88W EtherFast 10/100 8-Port Workgroup Switch does the job great, I did not have any problem with any linksys product. I use this switch with a WRT54G router because I needed extra wired ports. I gave 4 stars because I want a 100-200 volts transformer, this version use a 120 volts one",positive
"I wanted to replace my old 8-port switch, where I had my motorola cable modem, my server and my Linksys Wireless Router.  Worked great as soon as I hooked up.Smaller than the switch I had, and design and color match my WRT54G.Wanted this model, and Amazon got the best price.  Can't complain.",positive
Bought this after I ran out of ports on my wireless router.  Plugged it in and works great.  Can't ask for more.,positive
I have always used Linksys products and very good reliability from them. This is no exception as soon as I applied power and hooked up all my devices the unit performed without incident.,positive
Serves its purpose ! Quick and easy setup very little to no knowledge required to setup. Highly recommended for home use.,positive
I was able to make my home HI-Tech with the addition of my access point and this 8 point hub. Now all the rooms in my home are adequately hooked up and are up and running with the internet. Im very pleased with this purchase.,positive
Technology that outdates itself quickly.  Now with WI-FI this is old technology that lasted about  year for me.  The system worked ok but is history now.,neutral

"Plug-and-play with my existing network, which is comprised of 2-wire router, Netgear switch and this Linksys switch.  They all play well together.  I'm happy with this purchase.",positive
"Overall I'm very pleased with this workgroup switch.  The speeds are just as good as being connected directly to the modem.  The only thing worth noting is that the device I received is colored different.  Instead of being blue and black the one I received was all black.  As I said, this made no material difference, the device has worked properly for over 2 years now.  Very satisfied.",positive
"The Cisco-Linksys EZXS88W EtherFast 10/100 8-Port Workgroup Switch does exactly what it is advertised to do - 8 ports, plug it in, and it works great.  It doesn't get any better than this.  I could whine - it doesn't stack (without a mount) on my WRT54GL.  I solved this by not stacking it.",positive
I needed to add more devices in my office and this switch worked well.  Very easy to setup and use.,positive
Amazon does not give it's 30 day price guarantee on this item because it is sold by a company other than Amazon... watch out when you buy from Amazon.,positive
I had a problem with one I was using and decided to get this one. works right out of the box because its a switch no config. is needed. I would buy another one.,positive
"Works as advertised. Mine has been working well since I bought it. I have it in a network with one other linksys switch, a linksys router, and a dozen devices.",positive
The Linksys 8 port workgroup switch was just what I was looking for.I used this product to wire our small library to 6 computers and wireless access. It works great.,positive
Works good so far.Just remember to connect your computers in the order that the ports are labeled. I was having some connection problems until I realized I had moved some cables around and skipped a port.,positive
Had a previous version that was destroyed due to power surge and replaced it as simple as plugging in the power cord and the cables.,positive
"An easy, reliable means to add Ethernet ports to the typical 4-port router/hub. Who ever thought 4 ports would be enough? A whole lot easier than daisy-chaining routers!",positive
"Take it out of the box, don't confuse yourself with the user guide provided, it's  useless, and no quick setup guide (use the EZXS55W quick set up avail on Linksys site) if you have to. Or just power it up (plug it in), install patch cable to link it to your network, in my case the router, plug in those extra cables you have been swapping around on the 4 ports on the router, and you're ready to go.",positive
I got this Ethernet Card when I upgraded to DSL. It works well and I never experienced connectivity issues from it.,positive
"A good quality network card for setting up a home network.  I have 3 of these cards and have never had a problem with any of them.  I also use the LinkSys 5-port switch to connect them all and share the Internet with my DSL modem.  These network cards are rugged and reliable, and an exceptional value for the price!",positive
Have used this company's products many times.  This item is performing as I would expect it to do.  Linksys continues to have some of the best networking hardware available.  I commend Amazon for making Linksys products available to its customers.,positive
I bought like a dozen of these cards ranging from Version 4 to version 5.1 and all of them work very well in my LAN.I will recommend them to my friends and continue to buy them for my desktop PCs. They slap in and install perfectly w/o any problems. I've never had one fail or run erratically.STRONG BUY.,positive
"I had no trouble installing this card in my Windows 2000 Server. I  connected my Cable modem to it and success came quick and easy. It has been  in use for several months without any problem. Great product, great price.  I also have one of these in my Windows NT computer on this network - where  it is also working fine. Cheers !",positive
"I'm extremely pleased with this product. I purchased it to get away from using the USB connection for my cable internet connection.  On USB, the computer would hang quite frequently.  I've not experienced any hangs since installation of this card.Installation went smoothly; very impressed with its performance.",positive
"For some reason the ethernet port on my MOBO would not show up, so I purchased this to hard wire my router into my DSL modem. This was done trying to get the MagicJack to work, it did not help. One good thing did happen though, my on-board ethernet port showed up and all's good with that now. THIS BOARD IS DOING AS GOOD AS CAN BE EXPECTED.",positive
"I really liked this card until I bought a Netgear FS108 10/100 switch. No matter how I configured the LNE100TX card, it would only talk to the switch if I forced it to 10mbps mode. Forcing to 100Mbps wouldn't work, nor would autonegotiation.If I wanted a 10Mbps card, I would have gotten one. This is a poor performer.",negative
I have 3 LinkSys cards in my home network. The price was right and they have worked without a hitch. Installation was as easy as any network card under Windows 98 SE. Compatible with my VIA and Ali chipset motherboards.  Use with their 5 port hub or switch (hub with uplink port).,positive
"The card arrived securely packed.  Easy to follow instructions, and it works great!",positive
"I dropped this card into my Dell tower, which has partitions for Fedora Core 3 Linux (the one I use most) and Windows ME (only used when I have to.) It worked great. So I put another one into my wife's Quantum, which runs NT 4. Installation took a little more fiddling, but the card worked flawlessly after I'd found the right driver. It's inexpensive and it does everything we need for home networking.",positive
"If you want a quality network LAN computer card by an excellent company, this is it.",positive
"No problems, worked under 98, NT, 2K and Linux (tulip).",positive
"This card is easy to install and it'll work right after you install the driver and restart your system (95, 98, 98se)...Don't fall with the [inexpensive]NIC, go with BUS MASTERING..... it'll make you happy!",positive
"Inconsistent quality, iffy installation in Windows, and diagnostics only in DOS. This is the Linksys LNE100TX. We have plenty of our customer who opt for this card and have ended=up regretting doing so. The price is what initially attracts, but the shabby construction, questionable installation, and high failure rate - not to mention Linksys' horrible customer support.Avoid this one. You're not saving any money buying this card. You're only gaining headaches and dissappointment with the Linksys card.",negative

This handheld is made with great quality!  I myself had a Palm M105 which has very similar stats.  The Palm Vx is so much better made and the rechargible battery is awesome!  I would recomend this to anybody who needs to get organized or just likes to play games in school or work!,positive

I will continue to use my Palm Vx until it dies - permanently.",positive
"After using a Handspring, but going through batteries too quickly, I decided to upgrade to this timeless PDA. I have no complaints with it other than the serial sync is a lot slower than the USB sync. I love the built-in battery, metal case, and slim size.

"Works well for the most part, but if the battery dies all of it's information gets wiped. I bought this a loooong time ago and I know people probably just used phones now for this kind of thing, but if you're one of those who wants an organizer without having to pay for a damn phone and monthlies, just be aware of this problem and don't let it die",neutral
"Very reasonable & reliable product. Does what it claims to do. Easy to use, switches very easily. Note that it converts composite video to svideo & vice versa. So you only need to make one video input connection(svideo or composite video).  Highly recommend to anyone looking for simple manual audio/video switch.",positive
"I use it for my TiVo, DVD player and PlayStation and it works great. If you don't mind pushing a button, then it is much easier on the wallet then the $80+ automatic models available. The only thing to be aware of is that  it does not come with an extra S-Video/RCA cable to go from the box to the  TV, so if you don't have one, be sure to pick one up at the same time.",positive

I use this to store CDs and DVDs at my office and it has worked fine for me with no complaints for over 2 years now. Does what it is supposed to do.,positive
This is obviously not for anyone &quot;on the go&quot;. I don't go anywhere I need over 300 disks. I've purchase several of these to catalog and store my collection of music CD's.

This camera takes wonderful pictures but the zoom doesn't do the job.  its no good for taking pictures of your child playing football but its great for pictures on a trip.  be careful the lag between pushing the shutter and taking the picture is long as well as the time between pics at high quality.,positive

While USB is nice, not all computers  have it, and Windows 98 is necessary.  Also the 30-60mm zoom is no where  near as good as I would have liked-- DEFINETLY a 3x zoom is required.  While the resolution is nice, remember that that's not all to a digital  camera.",positive

These cables are a lot more hefty than anything i've ever seen.  I didn't compare quality to any other cables so I don't know about sound quality but it does sound good.  If you're like me you probably want to spend more time infront of the tv than behind it.,positive
"These aren't exactly audiophile grade, but work well in my application.  These were a special buy available through Amazon and were at about 1/3 the list price.  The cable jacket and connectors are sturdy.  At the price, I would definitely buy these again for &#34;all purpose&#34; usage.",positive
"I ordered several different brands of fiber optic cable to try, so I have not opened the packaging for this item.  However, the packaging and product looks like a high quality product as can be expected from Monster Cable.",positive
"Monster has a reputation for making great cables, but this series does not live up to Monster's reputation.  All other Monster cables that I have used are substantial, BUT the connectors on this model (series) are not made to last, are flimsy and fall apart after time.  (cables should last longer than a receiver)",negative
"This cable is worth every penny.  The connector is beautiful.  The ""M"" in Monster is wonderfully printed and the finger grips feel like work of art.  Other than the connector, I don't have much to say about this cable compared to other Toslink cables.  The innards are really all the same.  I can say that there is a marked improvement over the extended coathanger I had been using previously to connect my receiver to my audio equipment.",neutral
Nothing wrong with this cable:1. It is a brand name.2. The length is 1 meter or 3.28 feet - ideal for most component connections.3. It snaps in and out securely but not too easy to get disconnected (I've read reviews of other cables with that problem).4. Thirteen bucks shipped.,positive
"All Monster Cables are overpriced...avoid being ripped-off if at all possible. They are high quality though, so that's why they charge too much.",positive
I wanted a cable to connect from my computer to my Bose system.  This does the job admirably.,positive
"I used to buy the cheapest available cables for stereo connections. I found out over the years, that the sound quality was not real good, using the cheaper cables. That being said, my computer is on one side of the room, and my TV on the other. I thought I was going to make the connection with several shorter cables. This particular cable is 20 ft. long, and very well made. It fit my needs perfectly.",positive
This cable performs well and is a bargain for the person who wants to sit back and connect his computer to his TV with HDMI.  It couldn't have been easier.,positive
I had this about a year and mysteriously nothing plugged into it worked. Thought I had blown a breaker. Finally figured out this thing just suddenly stopped working... no reset.. no on/off.. just stopped working. Seems to be a lot of this happening with this strip. Now I have to spend more money on a good one.,negative
This product is highly recommended - I have bought several for multiple appliances.,positive
"I bought this to replace my cheap $2 strip, and I feel better protected when using it with my $$$$ Photo Lighting system.I'm sure the $2 strip would function just the same, but I used to sell Monster Cable back when the Good Guys was in business, and this stuff ALWAYS made a difference!!!It doesn't cost a little more just for the name....it costs more cause it Performs, and is Worth it!!!",positive
"I would give this five stars if it weren't for the ugly colors.  It is a great product and offered for a great price.  I think the price is lower because of the ugly colors.  It is nice that it is labeled for different entertainment inputs though.  They are color coated, they just make it look like a weird rainbow.  I still like it though and highly recommended the product.",positive
"So I guess I have never really put this thing through the test but I do live in an area where there are power outages.  NO damage to any of my components (Sony 27"" CRT TV; Onkyo home theater in a box system; Sony DVD player; Comcast Motorola Cable box).  Not sure if it was the monster hat protected it or not but no problems.  Color code is convenient and plug is flat to hug the wall.  Good price.",positive
"This product works great for flat screen tv's with the tv on the wall, it hangs perfectly and is ealy to manipulate.",positive
"I love the thick plug wire plus the offset of it. I am using it for my Xbox 360, receiver, and HDTV.",positive
"Works just like it is supposed to, no problems & it does exactly what I purchased it for.",positive
"A pimped out surge protector for the most expensive tech gear. Sure, it might be a bit overpriced, but you get what you pay for.",positive
"performing as described and I like it so far but I guess the real test is when there's a power surge.  I hopw that won't happen but it did, then I will edit the review if necessary",positive
it's a powerstrip. and it's easy to see the plugs. does what it should and feels well made. the end.,positive
Added this to my 55 gallon aquarium setup liking it so far its tucked out the way now my aquarium equipment will be protected,positive
i purchased a new tv for christmas with a blu ray player. I lose power a lot where i live when we get thunder storms. I got this to protect my electronics.,positive
"This surge protector comes with an unusually long cord making it easy to plug in multiple items with varying lengths of cord. The color coded outlets and coordinating, enclosed labels help to maintain organization.  Great buy.",positive
This is a simple easy power strip.  I went to college so I know you don't have to plug the VCR in to the VCR color plug.  It doesn't accommodate lots wall warts. Also be careful of which way power converters are aligned.  Also nice long cord.,positive
"This is your basic surge protector strip, with right angle plug and color-coded plugs for various audio-visual components. I have for a year and is still working",neutral
"Good product, very reliable. Good signage to know what plugs are for what. Packaging needs to be more eco friendly.",positive
This is an excellent unit and does what it's supposed to do. Makes it easy to shut off several circuits at once. I like it.,positive
It does the job and I have not had any problems with it so far.  I would order more when needed.,positive
"for the function at this price, Good. for the very good construction and thorough design to match the Monster quality, awesome!",positive
Bought a few of these to be surge supressors or power bars at various locations around the house.The price was right..  could not complain as it does the job.,positive
"Waste of money. It doesnt hold on to the plugs. Buy the Belkin. Better quality fer sure. Worth the money, too.",negative
"I did not rate this five stars because the flat male plug is on 45 degrees. That's fine if the electrical receptacle is left of where it is intended to be used but if the receptacle is to the right, cord will go off in the wrong direction till you can double it back. Also would be nice if it came in optional white or beige. The heavy black cord doesn't look good in our living room.",positive
"The two big selling points of this product for me was1. Extra long cord length2. Excellent Build QualityThe product came with outlets pre-labeled and some sticker ribbons for the user to attach to the cords themselves.  These are helpful, except when you want to plug in something that is not audio / video related.  (Not really that big of an issue though...haha.)",positive
Just love the color code to know which plug to pull or to insert what where it belongs.Don't have any complaints about this unit.,positive
It's a great power strip.  You can color code to which device goes to which plug.  I just wish it had one more plug to completely meet my needs.  The plugs are also spaced enough to allow just about any plug size without interfering with the next.  A solid power strip.,positive
"Just bought one at Best ___ for $29.95 plus tax. Needed it for Big TV that was arriving earlier than expected otherwise would have done it via Amazon. There price is just about 50% less.PS: Also wrote review on how my new 58"" TV was an $1100 dollar savings via Amazon as well.",positive
The angled power plug keeps it from being knocked out of the socket by the bed - just exactly what we have been needing for many years!,positive
My nephew wanted this for Christmas to plug in all his equipment.  He loves it very much.  I'm going to get one for myself.,positive
"If yer color blind, ya may not want this, but for those of you that are like the rest of us, this is a good power strip",positive
The plug end does not swivel like the Belkin model.  I had to pull out the receptacle from the wall and turn it over so that the power cable would point downward.,positive
I now have this power strip in every room of my house.  I plug all my vampire electronic products into it and turn off one switch to economize on the electricity drain of many electronics when they are not in use. This is a good looking power strip with a flat angled plug that sits close to the wall outlet. The cord is 6' long.,positive
"This power surge protector has plugs sideways, which works well for many devices with large plugs. It was a good price for a brand name product.",positive
Good power protection device; colorful does not do anything in particular.,neutral
"I was always concerned about the spacing between points of such devices. Same happens here, these are too closely spaced and some of the chargers eat up so much space not letting you place more than 3 or 4 devices at a time. Cannot complain too much of this because it is understood clearly from the device and its description and pictures. Other than this, its such an awesome device",positive
I really appreciate how each plug is color-coded. I was able to &#34;sharpie&#34; the plug to match the color of the plug and it makes finding which cord goes to which device easy. LOVE IT!,positive
I bought this as a gift for my husband and it works perfectly. We were looking for a power strip that faced to the side rather than to the skinny end (hope that makes sense). This did exactly what we wanted (even though we didn't use it for a TV!),positive
Great value for a monster branded product.  So far so good! Seems to hold up and love the color code on the bar vs. having to put a tag on each plug.,positive
"Good surge protector for the price.  Outlets are not too close to each other.  Seams sturdy.  The labels such as ""VCR"" or ""TV/SAT"" are completely unnecessary but they don't hurt anything.",positive
THE COLOR CODING IS OF ONLY SOMEWHAT VALUE.  THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THE PLUG TO THE WALL IS FLAT.  THE CORD IS ALSO A DECENT LENGTH.,positive
"I like the warranty...too bad their made out of the country; you want Americans to buy your stuff, but you don't employ them so they have the money...Think about it...the money you save- you lose...",positive
Failed after two months of use while only having a 42 inch tv plugged into it.  Inferior monster product.  I wouldn't buy again.  It seemed a good price for the item but not worth the headache.,negative
"Well, I'm not going to test the thing for it's endurance, but it does supply power to my less expensive home theatre system, I wish it has a higher rating for being a Monster Cable powersupply, but it works just fine.",positive
"Works like any power strip should and the quality of the cable on this feels very nice, its thick but not to stiff at all. The only complaint I have is on a few of these I bought some of them are hard to plug into like it may be off inside the device (Possible quality issue). But works with no issues.",positive
"and works - I don't really make use of the colors but I find it attractive. I just put a plug in the holes and that is that. Really this one is constantly in use and things go in and out and that is good for me. My phone charger, hair dryer, ipad charger etc. Very convenient and attractive.",positive
"We were watching TV tonight, and all off a sudden, my TV and box go on and off and on and off, while everything else stayed  on my house. Next thing i know, the house smells like burnt electronics. This ""quality"" surge protector was sizzling. I'm surprised the circuit didn't break.I am now on amazon buying a new surge protector, but will not buy this.",negative
Very useful and simple surge protector find much use out of it when hooking up different components of my home theater system also it pre labeled as well as color coded which can be very useful when connecting various different items.,positive
this power-strip keeps me from buying a new computer...have bought about 3 of these due to lightning strikes and they have saved my computer ever time.,positive
"Contrary to many negative reviews claiming this fails quickly, I haven't experienced that with either of my two.They are both still working correctly.One with my Home theater, and the other with a PC.I will update this review if i have any problems.",positive
"This is a great brand for the features and price.  The main feature I needed was the flat profile wall plug.  Having a 24K plated connector, color coded outlets and 8 ft cord were definite pluses.  Hard to find a better deal on a quality product like this!",positive
"Looks and feels nice, but broke after two weeks. I used it for rather high power appliances (3kW total) though.",negative
"I like the color coding and labeling I just wish I could write in my own labels.  Good product, would buy another one.",positive
"I like this a lot.  It has a longer cord than most power strips.  It is also a soft cable so it is easy to organize.  For the discounted price, this is a super deal on a great strip.",positive
This thing works well and the cable has a pretty decent length on it. The colors are nice to set things up and know what is what without having to label it yourself. I've had it for a few months and it is still going strong.,positive
This is a great power strip.... the warranty endorsed is great as well.. recommend to anyone... specially at this price...,positive
"It's a really good product, & I only deducted a star because what I wanted to plug into it was really too wide to fit them all. That isn't the fault of the strip though, and it's made very well with the 8ft cord making a huge difference.",positive
"This item failed after one month of use.There seem to be two breakers in this item:The first one is tied to the ""reset"" button. This circuit is closest to the shared socket side.The second one is tied to the ""on/off switch"". This circuit is closest to the wall side.The on/off switch is still lit up.However, none of the devices are getting power. The Reset button is useless and does not work.This item will be returned.",negative
I bought this power strip about 1.5 years ago.  It's still working well.  I also like that the colorful design makes it look a little nicer than the ordinary power strip.,positive
"I got this as a Deal of the Day and it was worth every penny. Monster products are great quality (but somewhat expensive), so when you can get them on sale they are definitely worth purchasing, as I know it will last for years and years.",positive
Love the color coding. Makes it easy to know which plug is which.  I have no complaints and love the price.,positive
"What can I say, its a power strip with added colors to show you what goes where. Thats pretty much it, overall it works, the wall plug is sturdy, cable gauge is quite rugged and high quality.",positive
I'm using this off of my UPS for extra equipment I maybe testing or using. Compaired to other multi strips you can't beat the quality and price.  Maybe a limited deal so not sure if still available.,positive
The flat plug easily plugs in behind my dresser without bending the cord.  The cord is 8 ft as described and long enough for my needs (reach from plug behind dresser to window).  I'm not crazy about the colors but it is a fine design.  Everything was as described and it works perfectly.,positive
"This is a no frills simple power strip. I user it for a secondary entertainment center for my TV, cable box and DVD player.The power strip does it's job. It does not have any power cleaning activity.The strip is a little bulky, but not too bad.For the cost it fits the need and the risk tolerance I wanted to pay for.",positive
"This has been excellent for my computer and and other accessories, I have been utilizing with my computer. since my purchase everything has been running very excellently.",positive
The cord is long and that`s why I like to use this..I have over 12..Recently however the price spiked and hope it`s only a temp supply issue it`s a good value and good build qual for the $,positive
"Recieved as a gift, used it for less than 1 year & it completely stopped working.  Had my computer plugged into it when the strip blew out. Thankfully the computer is fine, the strip got thrown in the trash. Would NOT recommend. You pay for what you get.",negative
"I was concerned because of the price, I thought that this item could have a regular quality, but its very good. I feel safe. Monster is a great company with high quality standards.",positive
very good power protector  for the price.. i liked it's long thick cord thats why i brought 2 ...i brought it to replace my other brand defective power outlet...,positive
"These are my powerstrips of choice, because of the super long cords and the angled plug that allows for tigh fits behind appliances, desks, dressers, etc...Only bad part about these are:  Everytime I buy one, I wish I would have purchased more at the time, because it always seems as though I need another one.",positive
"Over the years, I've purchase at least five of these Monster power strips.  I like that the cord is longer than most and the color coding system helps keep cords organized.",positive
"Whether you are a fan of Monster or not, the price is right even though it doesn't sound as fancy as the other surge protectors.",positive
"Your standard power strip, with surge protection. Does the job, outlets aren't inaccessible and plugs go in just fine. Colors are a bit obnoxious and the labels are completely unnecessary if you need this for other applications, but it works just fine. And it comes with a rounded plug that stays out of the way and doesn't obscure more than one outlet.",positive
"I ordered two of these in June 2011, and have not had any problems with them whatsoever. Great product AND a great price!",positive
"It works just fine and my wife is happy with it.  It replaced a generic model which had three failed outlets.  We've always had great experiences with our Monster power strips and surge protectors, so I expect this one will do just fine.",positive
"Works great!!!  There is not much else to say.  Have an HDTV, Blu-ray player, and satellite receiver hooked up.  Still working!!!",positive
"I have been using this product for last one month now with connection to 32 inch LCD , Xbox and sound system, works perfect. I think with the price tag this is optimum for the intened use. Good product and the seller too (packing/delivery good)Overall thus rating 4",positive
A good deal for a quality product. Monster has the best protection. Amazon makes it affordable with their free shipping.,positive
I recommend this power strip to all! The color coded graphic labels are great. Light weight and durable construction is the bomb!,positive
Just what I needed for the problem I had.  I would recommend it for those who have a need of a power strip.,positive
"Does the job . Everything I buy on Amazon I research it first , Then I read the reviews before I buyI always get a decent product",positive
"Monster MP AV600 Power ProtectorSo much better than cheap units. Our electric service is suspect, no more holes blown from cheap units into the carpeting!",positive
"This product is very useful and when I couldn't find anymore outlets, This has helped me in a variety of ways and now I have  unlimited number of outlets.",positive
"I do like Monster Power products but you certainly pay a premium to get them.  That's okay - it's slim, has plenty of plugs, and works.  After a lightening strike that blew out some other electrical items, this item was still running strong, so that's good.  I don't know if it mattered (the fuse box took most of the hit) but still, I'm glad my TV etc. didn't blow up.",positive
"In an area of the country where there are frequent electrical storms in the spring and summer months, it's important to have all your audio/video computers and smart phones protected from static discharge.  There are some cheaper strips out there, but Monster has been in the business for a long time and it's worth a few extra dollars not to lose that 1500.00 flat panel TV to a static discharge!",positive
There are too many quality power strips out there to waste your money on this one.  The number of failed strips (now 12 one star reviews) is an indication of just how risky it is to buy this item.  The strip powers on but there is no power going to anything that is plugged into it.  Pure garbage.,negative
"Works.  Its a Monster and quality built, but only good for standard plug cords. I would rather have seen the plugs run down the strip instead of across it.",neutral
I like the color coding of the power strip and it's a better strip than most cheap strips found in regular retail stores. Cords are good quality. I prefer Monster cables to cheaper makes and models.,positive
"I got a good deal on this.  I didn't buy it because it was monster brand.  I'm not a Monster fanboi or anything.  I just saw it go on sale and got a good deal and I needed one.  I like the layout of the plugs.  It gives you a good variety of spaces for transformers, etc.  I have all my computer and stereo equipment plugged into it and it hasn't missed a beat.  Works for me!",positive
"I mean its a simple power center, it works, I hope it doesnt fail, but you wont find out until its to late. Hope the brand name will stand up to their previous rep",positive
"This thing is huge, it really is a Monster. But it works great. I have every confidence that I am getting clean reliable power and surge protection. As well as great cable length. It's easy to identify products by the included color labels and logos on the device, and offers superior cable management options. All around a great product.",positive
"This is so much more sturdy and safe than the typical power strips! The plug fits fairly flush to the wall socket and the sockets on it hold plugs securely without being too tight. I don't use the cable protectors so I can't speak to that. I highly recommend this to anyone needing a reliable, safe power strip.",positive
"I bought two and all the pieces to a new desktop, they have plenty of space and colored plug ins. It made everything very easy to set up.",positive
It's nice to have the color coding to easily see which cord is which. There's no phone or ethernet protection. Fits a lot of cords in a fairly compact space.,positive
"Monster is one of my favorite brands . This works great and I love the color coded labeling that lets me see at a glance what I am unplugging without having to trace it back to the particular unit. Good job Monster......the rest of you, BUY THIS!",positive
"It actually replaced the exact same one I already had... Reason being, my portable heater/fireplace kicked on while I had my stero surrond sound unit and my big screen T.V. on all at the same time. It surged and all units shut down immediately, and the surge protector set off an alarm... Saved me about 8 grand... Highly recommend this unit.",positive
"Let me start by saying that I have another Monster unit that protects my front room's electronics and I needed a new protector for my bedroom.  This product meets my needs; it protects a TV, Sat Box, PS3, and a hard drive enclosure.The protector is good quality and has a strong and long cord.  If you do not care that it is labeled for a VCR and don't run coaxial or telephone cable I highly recommend this product.",positive
Very easy to use and durable even with my heater.  I tested it for two weeks during the day and the power surge was still cool to touch.,positive
"Produto de primeira linha. Cumpre o que promete. Robusto, bom acabamento e resistente. Item imprescind&iacute;vel para montar um conjunto de home theater.",positive
Then there was suddenly a weird ringing sound and everything plugged into it turned off.I need better reliability than THAT!,negative
"What can I really say?  It does what it's supposed to, or at least I think as I haven't run across any power issues.  I've always been happy with Monster products and thus far this is no exception.",positive
"If you want to pay $100 for this then go to your local retail store and buy their older model for 3x the price. This things is protecting/powering my Onkyo 7.1, Blu Ray, Satellite, 47"" LCD w/ zero problems. If you are thinking about this think no more and buy it now!",positive
I love this item.  I researched before buying and truly believe the Monster Cable one is one of the better ones on the market.  Glad I bought this partucular one.  Easy to use.,positive
"The product met expectations and was adequate for my home theater system, including TV, Blu-ray player, audio video receiver, CD player, and cable modem and cable tv box.",positive
"Bought 2, they worked flawlessly, Monster brand is premium quality at a premium price! I would recommend this to my friends!",positive
"For your audio/visual equip.  I have my samsung tv as well as PS3, surround sound, NES, and Atari hooked to this and passed through multiple storms safely.",positive
"I purchased this item because I wanted a surge protector and to know what plug connected to what device. It works great! never pull out the wrong plug anymore and always know which plugs are going to which device. Have no complaints. Have only had this product for about 3 months now thought, Also enjoy how many outlets there are",positive
Nice product which is color coded to help assist in controlling the maze of electrical cords to our home theater/stereo system.,positive
"Strait forward design and everything is labeled if you can't see colors and color coded if you can't read.If you need one, this one works.",positive
"I do not have any complaints, Is a good surge protection. Monster is premium quality at a premium price in the market",positive
We bought the first one for our tv set up & loved it so much I bought a second one for my home office. We live in Florida which next to AL is the lightening storm capital of the US. So far out power has gone out but our toys are still working.,positive
Tucked it away into my console - it's always there!  I plug everything into this thing - including the vacuum cleaner!,positive
This is exactly what I wanted and I found the best price for it here. I couldn't have ask for a better deal.,positive
The fact that these are discontinued is quite a shame. These were my go to power surge protectors for the longest time. I will miss these!,positive
"I was having major issues with lesser surge protectors being able to keep up with the constant A/C usage and allowing me to use the lamp and laptop without blowing the circuit or the protector.  This bad boy is compact (when you factor in all of the plugs you get, has a convenient side plug, which allows it to fit snugly behind my couch, and this sucker does the job!",positive
Used this for my tv. It had plenty of places to plug in the components.  And it had a good Joule rating.,positive
"I rated it 5 stars because it is a great protector for the price.  You have ample ways of hooking up all your pieces.  Of course, this one is discontinued but I'm sure they made the newer model even better.  Don't know if it actually works because we haven't been hit by lightening or anything.  I have faith though.",positive
I was looking or a large capacity labelled surge protector and found it.  Great price and quality and I will probably purchase another.,positive
"This product is everything it promises. I had investigated other options before buying, but you never know until you open the package and use the product. Good value item!",positive
Saved money and got the right product to protect my new HD TV and PS3.  Same product but lower than local BIG BOX retailer.,positive
"Worked as intended. At the end of the day, it is just another extension, and all tat color stuff just a waste of time.",positive
"It's not the prettiest thing in the world, but it is very functional, and is great for hooking up multiple items with power bricks. I have had this up and running for quite some time, and have no had a single issue with it. The cord from the wall to the strip is very long, so setting up the power strip away from an outlet is a very viable option. For $20, it's hard to go wrong.",positive
"I have 4 Monster surge protectors, and two are this exact model - AV800. It offers great peace of mind at great price. I like the protection against the surge from the TV antenna. I highly recommend it.",positive
No signal lose or connection issues to report.  The sockets are easy to get to and coaxial connection was a breeze.,positive
"Plenty of space between the plugs for those bigger adapters. Comes with stickers to label all of your cords. There color coated to the plug color, so no more hoping you unplug the right plug.",positive
I was looking for an inexpensive surge protection unit that would safe guard my AV equipment.  I was a little skeptical because of the price.  This unit appears to be made well.  I like its simplicity and it's size.  This is a recommended purchase.,positive
"Just the surge protector I needed, comes color coded so you can easyly find what's hooked up to that plug!! Great!",positive
"Didn't need anything fancy to plug in my media. The price is right and it works perfectly. Power surges are not common here, but I'm ready for 'em!",positive
"It is what it is. Works perfect however when you read the directions in the package, honestly... there is no warrantee. your entire house would have to be grounded to this one unit in order for it to cover the damage from a power surge. That is what homeowners is all about. If you are worried about your saved computer stuff... then get a cloud. Although, I do not regret making this purchase.",neutral
"When on sale, you can't beat it. Monsters surge protectors have never failed me and the warranty is solid. I don't trust thousands of dollars of tv & stereo to straight in the wall or cheap no name brands from the local walmart......Get 'em on sale and you will always fly that way....",positive
I buyed  this Surge Protection and i live in a country with 220vThis product DONT SUPPORT 220v what a shame !!! at least put that info in the Product details OR SOME WHERE !!!  40$  in shipping on the trash !!!,negative
"I've had this for about a year and it has done it's job. I don't unplug it when there is a thunderstorm so if there is a powerspike in the line, it must be catching it.",positive
"I purchased one of these a while back for my large screen TV and related components and I also purchased another just recently for my computer and components, great product for added protection.",positive
Monster surge protectors and power strips are excellent and offer plenty of outlet space.  Bought three for my home office and they are doing the job with ease.  I absolutely would recommend them to anyone.,positive
"Usually these monster surge protectors come with a steeper price because they are supposedly built with high quality materials. Well i havent yet been able to prove if its true or not and maybe thats a good thing lol. Well the product works as intended and at a great price, i love the colored sockets help separate the appliances.",positive
"Here's the deal.  I don't know or understand much about surge protectors.  I just know that when you but new electronics, you should buy a new surge protector suitable to the product you are buying.",positive
"all my surge protectors/outlets are all monster cable. quality brand. i do wish the length of the a/c cord could be a little longer. I think it's about 4 feet long. They should make an extended a/c cord version like 10 feet or something. otherwise, stick with monster cable",positive
We have a lot of power surges and if you don't want to fry your equipment a surge protector is a must. A greatproduct with Amazon's big discount and usual super fast shipping.,positive
"the product arrived broken. I could hear parts loose inside so I RMA it. It kind of make u wonder what kind of monster product your getting for 15 dollars... u have to be careful when ordering stuff online, make sure your not getting Chinese replicas. Although this product looks like a monster product I highly doubt it was....",negative
Surge Protector are not someting I get to emotional about unless they don't work and one of myelectonic gizmoes get fried.  This one seems to work ... and I'm happy.,positive
Purchased these three years ago and could not be happier.  Three years running and this is the only power strip you will find in my house.  My condo is a man cave electronic paradise and have had zero issues to date.  I purchased this item at $17 dollars each and if i recall correctly i ordered six of them.  Must Buy for expensive electronics!,positive
"This is my second one and I love these. This product is worth the price and it works great. It you spent a ton on money on electronics, this is the best way to protect them from surges. We would recommend.",positive
"Great value. I have had no issues with the product. Unfortunately, this is one of this items that you find out about how good it is when things go wrong. Hopefully it is never put to the test.",positive
I have one of these I bought years ago and it is still going strong. I needed another surge protector to use with my PS4 and Xbox One and assorted cable boxes and router. Hooked everything up and have not given it another thought. Just what you want out of one of these. Got it at a fantastic price so I'm happy with my purchase.,positive
Great unit for the price. Able to house up to eight devices. Had mine for several months and several thunder/lighting storms. Still going strong.,positive
"nice product! although the printed label doesnt coincide with what i plugged in, it is still a very nice product and seemed to protect all my gadgets...thanks!",positive
"This is the most overpriced item, I own several Monster power items, and their higher end units are great but this thing is worthless, you might as well get a no name brand.I had this thing one my 3rd TV and it fried out within 2 weeks, and none of the others did.",negative
"Great product. works well. If you over AMP this product, it will shut off but will probably never work again. I have two surge protectors that got overloaded and never worked again. Monster has a great warranty & replacement, but they are a bit difficult to get to customer service or help. Make sure you know your jules and amps for what you are using it for. Otherwise, it works great and has decent spacing for 2 larger outlets.",neutral
"Does exactly what I purchased it for. Powerrs several devices from one plug. The Monster name is well known and trusted, so the slight extra expense was worth it.",positive
"One of the best surge protectors i ever bought.  I labeled, it comes with labels, and monster is a brand you could trust.",positive
This Monster power strip is supposed to suppress line voltage noise which in theory should give you better sound and picture and peace of mind should your power go out and snap back on (spike).  Crutchfield's actually did a measurement with and without this power strip and the results where astounding!,positive
"The only negative to Monster brand is the reality quality costs more than riskier inferior competitors. Yes, you MIGHT be able to get others for less to work almost as well  but you will sleep better when you trust the Monster label.",positive
"I had three extension cords piggybacked into two wall outlets. That is not good, so I ordered this thinking it probably wouldn't be worth the money. BUT it was !!! This was a very heavy duty item as well as a strip cord.  I was able to systematically remove the electrical nightmare. And now I also have one free outlet on that wall socket. I am impressed. So much so I will be buying another.",positive
"There's not a whole lot you can say about this item, it does what it says and there aren't any surprises.While I usually like to save my five star ratings for things I really love, I just don't know what they could have done any different with this... so, it gets my coveted five star rating.Price is pretty good too... I'll buy more if they're still around.",positive
So far I haven't had the need for a higher price one.  We don't have a lot of fancy equipment .. I felt no need (and I was correct) to purchase a $500 surge protector that C.City recommended.,positive
The color coding is a nice touch on the plugs. Makes for a tidy arrangement for the numerous power cords.,positive
"Product is splendid value for the money, although I'll admit I bought the name for I have known and trusted Monster products for many years. The product will handle ONLY coax, and has excellent response time and Joules rating. Sadly, I purchased it for my mother AFTER the lightning hit the tree across the street....",positive
"I've never understood surge protection. This one delivers fantastic surge protection, but so what? lots will. Rumor. Rumor. Rumor. This one is WOW! When properly engaged it delivers onto your HD screen thickening colors, smoothing audio, almost erasing drop-offs. You'll wonder if you've still got the same HDTV. It's that GOOD!",positive
"This surge protector does what it is supposed to do. It is designed for TV/Home Theater use and has the proper outlets for that purpose. I detect no interference using the cable protection. I have used Monster surge protectors for all my electronic needs, and the reasonble price at Amazon makes that easier to do.",positive
"I bought this to protect my Marantz home theater, PlayStation 3, and Samsung flatscreen.Outlets are well spaced and this device protects my incoming cable service also.  So, if I suffer a lightning strike, will it work?  Stay tuned...",positive
"I use this for my home tv entertainment. It works well, and protect your asset. I refer people to buy it.",positive
"Amazon had a good price on this Monster surge protector, my old surge protectors were worn out.  I plan to order more of these surge protectors if they are still available.",positive
I have three of these now and they work great for my home theaters.  3M command strips work well to mount it on a wall too.,positive
This worked for a couple of weeks. Now when I plug it into the wall it makes a loud buzzing sound. Now I have to deal with their warranty department. I'll update this review with that experience.,negative
Like the spacing for adapters and the extra long cord as typical w/monster adapters. Like the spacing for adapters and the extra long cord as typical w/monster adapters.,positive
"This is a good enough surge protector. GIven how much Monster knows about multi media setups, I wish they had spaced out the sockets a bit more. I seem to have a lot of fat headed plugs (adapters for hand drives, cable modem etc) that really crowd out the sockets. There is a lot of real estate on the unit, so I dont know why Monster did not space the sockets out.",negative
"Great product, purchased this for a friend and they love it. I would not buy it as it is unnecessary to purchase this expensive of a surge protector.",positive
"I already had three of these units.  When I saw this as a Black Friday Deal I couldn't pass it up.  It's not the latest model, but it offers superior protection for my electronics and has plenty of outlets for all sizes of plugs.  Highly recommend.",positive
typical surge protector. has plenty of room between plugs and works just as described. Not the best looking but mine is hidden,positive
Just bought a new Sony HDTV and these surge protectors make everything including the TV safe.,positive
this product safely protects your electronic products while offering multiple plug in options. it comes with a quality coax cable too.,positive
This company makes probably the best surge suppressors there are.  They are not cheap and perform as advertised.  Bought two to protect some of my touchier electronics.,positive
It's exactly what I needed and it looks good doing it's job.  It's a great buy and well priced.  I plan to buy another one as a spare,positive
"Used to sell these at Best Buy for $79.  You do the math, a great protection for your equipment.  Gave this to my daughter for stereo and tv.",positive
"I purchased this surge protector for a 40"" LCD TV.  The price is reasonable with free shipping from Amazon.  No excessive effort required with the plugs.  Unit has built-in surge protection for the cable line.",positive
"I find this to be a very well built power center. Of course, the proof would be in whether it can really protect when that big surge hits. I hope I never have to find out. We do get a bit of static on our HD TV on occasion by running the cables through the protector. But that might be from the cables and not the protector.",positive
"Monster has awesome products and this is no exception. I use them on just about every outlet connected to equiptment like the laptop, phone charger, etc. Awesome price should have purchased more",positive
Works great. Looks and feels solid heavy. I use it for my home tv and audio.Will have to see how it holds up during power surge.Highly recommend.,positive
"The labels are specially designed for an entertainment system.  I like the size of this unit.  The coaxial cable that comes with it us of good quality.  I got it for a great price which makes it easier to overlook any flaws.  If you are very organized and want to designate where each plug goes, this is perfect.",positive
"And the Labeling of what you plug in, The eight receptacles have been helpful to get the cable, internet, TV,  & Sound Systemall plugged in.",positive
"Ordered this from Amazon because it was the best price.  It is color coded and labeled so you know where your TV, Stereo, etc. is plugged in if you choose to use these.  It also has surge suppression for your cable/satellite connections.  The actual plug and cord that goes to the wall is very long.  I am very happy with this product and think it is a good deal.",positive
"nicely coded for easy installation, enough room for transformers, the color codes are just great for any beginner or novice to connect",positive
"Good quality, using for my computer so the labels don't work for me. Much cheaper than local stores. Works good. Have used a similar one for my home theater, no problems. Wish I paid this price for my last one.",positive
Good quality product.  Good spacing for plugs and connections are secure and protect your electronics. This model is the older version but works great.,positive
"They say that if design is good, it should be 99% invisible.  I bought this years ago and have barely thought about it sense.  Reliable, functions well, good purchase.",positive
"This is what I needed. So many cables in the back of my entertainment center, this organizes them via color. Tabs for the power cords so you can easily rematch anything you may have to unplug at a later date.",positive
"people who think designed this...practical thinkers..i see a well thought out, well carried out product being sold at a reasonable price.however, the manufacturers description has one flaw...this does NOT have phone line protection...everything else is as described.yes i recommend and i would again buy, and just might for other areas of the house and shop.",positive
I understand they came out with a replacement model which was selling for twice the price. I'm glad I found this one for its phase out price because I needed two of them. I installed them both and ran the cable TV wire through the provision for that. Everything works perfectly.,positive
I bought this surge protector following a storm that seemed to mess up my last protector.  The Monster Cable protector works just fine and hase plenty of room for all of my PC and office plugs.  The extra wide sockets come in very handy too.,positive
There are still some really good buys out there that also bear quality... and this is one of them.  We are very happy with this product!  It seems to be made top quality!,positive
Thought this would be enough for the entertainment system. It is working as expected now. easy to connect and use. I found the labels helpful against each power outlet..,positive
This is a must buy for your valuable purchase. In my place I have seen that the electricity fluctuates a lot. This provides protection to valuable equipment.,positive
"THIS SURGE PROTECTOR ACCOMMODATES THE LARGE PLUGS, AND ITS NICE TO HAVE THE COLOR IDENTIFICATION AND THE LONG CORD WITH THE PROTECTION.",positive
I've used monster power equipment for a while and have not been disappointed in the past.  The same is true for this power supply.,positive
"I recently bought a new plasma tv and some home audio gear and wanted to protect my investment. This fits the bill perfectly and is reasonably priced. So far its seems to do the job,  one lightning storm and no fried electronics!",positive
As with most Monster products they are superior to the cheaper store bought power strips. Highly recommend.,positive
It's a good power strip.But it should be around $15.I like its look and feature anyway. Monster makes good products.,positive
I give this only a 4 star rating because I have only started using this and I don't know over all how this will perform over time. So far it's lasted about 3 days since I unpacked it. I would have given it a 5 star if I had it in use longer.,positive
"Legendary quality at a very low price. I personally don't care if it's last years model or even discontinued, it just works very well at a great cost.",positive
I could plug an air conditioner into this thing! word word word wordword word word word word word word word word word.,positive
Exactly what I needed.  The large plug ins definitely helped with space issues for my other things on my entertainment center and can now hide this strip behind my components.,positive
"I like this product, I have a few power strips for my entertainment and computer needs and I like this item",positive
This fits the bill nicely at 20 bucks while you could spend 200+ with the same company really getting the same item. If you have a basic home theater set up this will do just fine. I have no reservations with mine,positive
"I haven't had any problems, but I'll update if I do.  Nothing fancy; just a power cleaner that works as advertised so far.",positive
"works like every other power strip i have got from them only one has had a problem that is one of the green product versions.  its great, cheap and has good spacing for the plugs",positive
"This has been one of, my best investments. Monster is the right name for this power center, it protects all of your most valued electronics. Don't let it go by without buying one. You will thank me, for this review. But I know you work hard to earn your pay check, the last thing you would like to have to happen, is for your equipment to get damaged. Because you used a cheap, or no surge protector.",positive
"great price on Amazon, meets my needs perfectly.  have HDTV, cable box, receiver, subwoofer, Blu-ray, and antenna plugged in without any space issues.  flat outlet plug is a plus",positive
I am so happy I bought this. I bought it  so I can use it for my fish tank and it is just right. I would buy it again.,positive
"I noticed a slight difference in picture quality - somehow this must be helping with electricity fluctuations in my home. I connected this to another single-plug surge suppressor that is plugged into my wall. As this Monster unit also provides me with filtered electricity, I would rather sacrifice another surge suppressor instead of the Monster unit.",positive
"I spent a little more than the bare minimum on this,and I'm glad. It is helpful to have the labels and color codes.  And after two hurricanes hitting this region in recent years, I'm glad to have a unit with some heft and recognized brand standing behind the warranty.",positive
"These were on sale and obviously they are top notch.  I bought three of them for my office, and they are excellent surge protectors and power strips.  I definitely would gladly recommend these.",positive
"B/c Monster pricing (discounting) has come down quite a bit over the years, I usually buy Monster surge protectors/filters for all of my televisions.  So far so good, although I haven't had one actually have to be used during a surge scenario.  I like the flat plug, on/off/protected/ground indicators, colored/spaced outlets, and even included coax cable.",positive
"We used this on a piece of medical equipment that was not functioning properly due to a noisy power source. It filtered the niose, fixing the problem.",positive
"I use this on my main HT setup, and haven't had any issues through numerous blackouts. I bought a new TV on Black Friday, and decided to replace the dusty old surge protector I was using. Sprung for this again @ $20, and I can't complain. I'm not an expert on AV stuff, but I usually buy Monster solutions because they appear to be tried and true.",positive
"Although the product is great and the protection indicator gives you a sense of security, the looks could improve.  Easy to install, and easy to mount on walls in a vertical position.",positive
"I did my research, and this model power surge protector had exactly the features I wanted, and none of the extras I would never use.Do your research, figure out what you are plugging into a surge protector, and then buy the one that suits your needs.I saved about $40 buying this item online here at amazon. The surge protector was brand new in the packaging and has worked great ! no problems.",positive
"Haven't had any power surges to try it out but it does what it does, allows me to hook up my entire home theater system to one outlet.",positive
"I bought this when I upgraded to a HDTV and surround sound.  I've been using it over a year now without any problems.  Every socket is being used without any glitches.  If you need a lot of sockets and a reliable, well made power strip, this is the one to buy.  It's pretty cheap as well making it a great deal!",positive
A fine quality product from Monster. Nice to have the different options and the price was perfect. Great for all entertainment systems.,positive
"Colorfully labeled, this surge protector like power strip is very easy to use to coordinate all your electronic devices. It takes the guesswork out of which plug goes to what device.",positive
"It's a power strip, not really a lot to say.  I got two of these for a very low price.  Monster products are pretty pricy, however if you get them on sale they are well made, attractive looking, and have been reliable so far for me.  I have several surge protector/power strips from Monster (all purchased at steep discounts from list) as well as some cables.  They all work fine, and the ergonomics are very good.",positive
"While this is a very good product, iot like all Monster products is about 40%  over priced.  Thee are cheaper solutions with a lower price tag.  Received quickly.",positive
Someone once told me that something is working well if you never notice it is there. That is the case with this monster. It just keeps doing its job without notice. It looks nice and sturdy for the price. In addition to electrical protection it has provisions for cable and telephone protection. And it is a Monster who have a good overall reputation.,positive
"This is a great looking item, with great markings for each component. The only down side for me is it only has 8 outlets and I need 10.",positive
I give this product a 4 because it is probably to expensive but it does hat its supposed to do.  I bought it when i purchased a news 61 inch tv and a bose surround system and i wanted to make sure that my new stuff was safe.  This product does give me piece of mind.  It also looks cool and the lable really do come in handy.,positive
"I'm using the Monster Cable MP Home Theater PowerCenter HTS800 to remove line noise in the electrical current to a high-end tube pre-amp.  The line noise is removed beautifully; however, the PowerCenter itself creates a high-pitched tone.  The tone comes out of the PowerCenter device directly.  If you are planning to use this product on a high-end sound system, I recommend placing it in a location that is acoustically isolated.",positive
"Can't use the item since it does not work with 220V power outlet (Europe standard power) and there's no any information about this incompatibility. I've bought it to power all my devices with US power plug using one US-EU connector, but when I switch that device on I just have a power outage in the room. Now I'm not sure if it is still working at all.",negative
"No problems to report.  Sockets are easy to get to, and coaxial connection was a breeze.  You spikes or shield problems to report.  Cable cutter is happy.",positive
Needed a couple of decent power strips for two television areas preferably under twenty bucks.  Got it!  No complaints. Also comes with accessory cord labels and quality phone cord if needed.,positive
"It looks nice and is easy to install.But that is all.After a recent storm I had $5000.00 worth of home theater equipment rendered inoperable.The result of my contact with monster?One generic email the nothing ,zip,nada.Save your money.",negative
Good quality low price power center with noise filter. This power center has good outlet spacing allowing for transformers to fit without covering outlets as some power centers have not incorporated this design causing loss of total number of available outlets.,positive
"works well as this is the 2nd one I purchased.  Like all monster products they tend to be overpriced, however with exceptional quality",positive
"I prefer Monster over any other cable brand. How can I get excited about reviewing this product? I use it only as a power strip, since I have a dual-tuner DirecTV/TiVo and a Phillips LCD TV connected via component video. I understood what I was buying though, so I won't ding Monster for the item. It does its job and it does it well, but there are no bells and whistles on this thing.",positive
"Great bang for the buck if your looking for an inexpensive but good quality surge protector,also if you have an HDTV you need a special type of protector like this one,because the TV's are much more susceptible to power surges,and this Monster Cable Powercenter is meant for HDTV's and other sensitive electronics.",positive
This unit powers my 55 inch Panasonic Viiera HD set.  We have lived through quite a few electrical storms with no issues.  Good solution and a good price.,positive
"No problem thus far, appears to be doing the job as nothing has been fried yet.  Have it in the garage powering various rechargeable tools.  In Florida brownouts are a concern.",positive
"Each outlet is labeled which helps in identifying your device when needing to change or move it.  We have had this since 2008 and we have gone through thunder storms, power outages, etc... and we have not had any issues with our electronic devices.",positive
I bought this to hook up my buddies PA system and guitar amps when we jam and do gigs.he was getting a nasty buzzing noise previously though all of his speaker systems but now the buzzing is gone thanks to Monster.This is a great purchase not only for hooking up multiple devices but for cleaning the signal noise and other stuff coming through the power lines.,positive
This power center provided everything I need for my home theater setup. The only feature I wish it had is a shutoff option for certain accessories to eliminate phantom power.,positive
Picked up this Monster HTS800 power strip for my home theater system.  The color coded labels are helpful. I have peace of mind knowing that the unit has a high joule rating and a huge warranty protection plan.,positive
sorry to see it disco`ed by mfr...Love the long cord...hope they make a new model of this soon and will buy again,positive
"WHen I need a new power stage, I turned to AMAZON and found this product on GOLD Box.  Works well, a lot of plugs, a feed through cable connection. Does the job for my 60&#34; HDTV-DVR-DVD-BLU-RAY.",positive
"I bought two of these to replace some very old units around the house and these things work really well. There is ample room for those items that have power bricks, and the power filtering has helped with an older TV that used to squeal after being on for a while.",positive
Use this for my various electronic Korg instruments to be plugged into. Reasonable cost effective strip offers decent clamping for the price. Great value,positive
"I think this surge protector is great.  Some of the labels were not applicable to me so I had to just use an accessory plug, but everything seems to work.  I love the rocker switch.  I originall bought a Belkins Surge Protector with a Push Button switch.  I could not get the on and off switch to turn off so I returned it and bought this Monster Surge Protecter and I am pleased.",positive
"I lost my previous RadioShack surge strip and the various pieces of equipment attached to it in the Queens power failure and wanted something dependable. The price is great for its rating and all the stuff included, and it is kind of cool-looking too!  Recommend without reservation.",positive
Just built a new home theatre and used this surge protector.  Does exactly what it advertises allowing multiple components to be installed at one source point and provides surge protection and insurance for a bargin price.,positive
"I was happy to be able to pick this up on Amazon for half the price that Monster charges if you buy it from them directly! It's solved the problems I was having with my laptop freezing almost every time I plugged it back into the wall. My cheap Belkin power strip wasn't preventing the power spikes that this area is known for. It looks like something straight out of the 1980s, but it works!",positive
"I bought one of these to protect my mom's computer.  Her house got struck by lighting and it went through the phone line and this stopped any damage from happening to her computer.  The power strip was toast, so I bought her another one just like it.",positive
"I have 4 of these now plus two older monster strips.  Haven't fried anything plugged into any of these while 3 or less years old.  Like the thick cords.  My house tends to have a high mortality on cheap power supplies (electric shavers, aftermarket phone chargers, external hard drives etc..), but they don't seem to fry plugged into these things.",positive
"Great extension cable I use with some of my electronics on the go. Great product, typical Monster quality, at a not so Monster price, surprisingly.",positive
No interference noise and very sturdy cable. Have it running a power plug to my guitar amp and have had no issues with it.,positive
"I needed an long power cable for a subwoofer, and I liked the flat-type power wall plug on this one (couldn't find it separate anywhere). I actually cut off the 'extension' connector and attached an IEC C13 RIGHT ANGLE POWER CORD CONNECTOR (also purchased on Amazon), to attach that to the sub. Love the cable. Very solid, thick and yet flexible. In my case, a perfect combination. Very happy.",positive
"The unit I received had a female plug on one end and a male on the other, but I just cut one end off and wired the male end into my old Marantz power amp. Results were very nice and looks impressive. Overall this cable is an excellent value as other powerline 100 cables were much more pricey.",positive
"I so needed a strong extension cord for my monster power surger and this is it.  Don't be fooled by the picture.  The cord is not cut or loose like that, it is a regular male on one end female on the other end extension cord.  Quality, does the job and a great Amazon price.",positive
"Using the component input on your TV can make a huge difference in picture quality, but the differentce between the lower priced monster cables and the most expensive monster cables in not noticeable. Save yourself $50 and buy the cheap ones.",negative
I've already given a favorable review for this product & the vendor. What else is there to say that I haven't said.,positive
"These are great wires the quality is very nice, much nicer quality than cheaper wires. The price is very good for these wires compare to what most others charge for this same wire.",positive
"Definite difference if you are using an HDTV the DVD picture is much clearer, only wondering if HDMI is even better? Only downside is, I wish the cables were about 10ft long for more slack.",positive
These cables are the bomb! I could totaly tell a difference in the picture quality. If you want a good home theather system then ya gotta get these cables. You will love them like i do. It was coolBig Truck,positive
"I bought these primarily because I needed a little more reach to hook up my VCR to my receiver.  It does the job fine.  It didn't improve my picture.  It didn't make my life suddenly worth living.  It's a cable.  Nothing more, and nothing less.  It's extra long, and it worked exactly like I wanted it too.",positive
"This is from a Fluke 75III meterSignal induction/crosstalk between conductors = unmeasureable.Signal loss on 2 data wires = ~.05 Ohms from pin to pin.Signal loss on 2 (distinct) ground wires = ~.06 Ohms, pin to pin.Solder joints (while not entriely pretty) are not cold/flawed in any visible way.The individual ground shielding at one end of my cable was close to contact, but was not touching.Overall i'm pleased...",positive
The part number is actually MVSV3-8M which makes this clearer.  Not sure why Amazon isn't including cable lengths in their descriptions...,positive
"Great cable. Easy to work with and VERY flexible. You can bend it over on itself if needed. It's a little bit wide, but I knew that from looking at the picture. It fit under my baseboard perfectly. Sounds perfect!",positive
I ran this along the baseboards and door moulding in my basement. The sound is great. Wires blend in. My only suggestion is to buy more that you think you need. 50 feet isn't a lot! I needed 2 packages for my install.,positive
I bought it because I wanted to have great quality cables but that &#34;blend&#34; with the wall I'm order to avoid buying other accessories to route them to the speakers. This cable did the job. I adhered them to the wall via a light coat of silicon caulk in one side and they are firmly set. After that I painted them and they are almost invisible.,positive
I've used this speaker wire before. I like this speaker wire cause you can hide it behind the crown molding. It's flat and is very flexible. It's easy to work with.,positive
"Easy to work with, flat cable. Used this type as customer wanted to run it along wood floors and hide behind molding. Very thin design, carries sound well.",positive
The cable itself is great.  Very flat and easy to hide.  The speaker connectors that came with it aren't that great.  They are not extremely easy to put on.  The seller delivered my item in a good time.  No complaints there.,positive
I used this to split the video portion of my Cablevision Digital IO service and it worked perfectly. This is actually a second splitter on my line since the first provided by Cablevision is used to split the signal into TV and Cablemodem lines.,positive
I bought this along with a monster cable... now I know monster is way over priced but I think this splitter is worth it.I wanted to hook up my cable modem and my cable TV with no loss to my cable modem and it did what it said it would.I wont give it 5 stars because I know it's [...].,positive
Did exactly what I needed. Split the cable from my wall to the TV and Cable Modem.,positive
"We have a very high-end home theater system, which clearly shows the contribution for good or ill of every component. We pulled this turkey instantly and sent it back.",negative
I checked out a few splitters before I purchased this one. I used it in conjunction with a Motorola signal booster and with the combination I am more than satisfied with the picture quality; I am very happy I made the purchase. Picture quality is great!,positive
"boy did it ever!  The cable company came and installed our cable modem and used a cheap splitter. I upgraded to this and the difference was amazing. Our cable internet seems to run better and the TVs seem to have better picture. Maybe its just an illusion, but after using my parents internet modem with a cheap splitter, maybe not.  Well worth the extra money.",positive
I needed a quality splitter for my digital cable and i couldn't find anything of quality at the local shack.Anyway i found this splitter on Amazon and it does the job great.Picture quality on the outputs of the splitter is great.I'd recommend this.,positive
"- Monster name brand, means high prices, but I've never been disappointed with Monster products!- Performs well from what I can tell, have 4 cable boxes running off it, and its perfect.- Quick shipping and a nice price from amazon.- Be aware it has 4 splits, and the 5th is the Cable IN.",positive
"I don't know how Monster charges these prices with a straight face. My cable guy said ""we don't use these"" -- ""not recommended"" -- ""does not improve reception"".  My cable company uses standard, red-labeled, lower cost, 5-1000mhz splitters.  They work just fine!",negative
"I choose this rating because of The Company. Monster Cable make excellent product and are high grade product. The Item works great. I needed It for hooking up a 2 TVs, computer , and the internet.",positive
Appears to work as advertised and is currently being used to connect two Homerun and one TV.  All signals appears to be the same.,positive
"Works great. Actually improved SNR(signal noise ratio). To check your signal turn on tv and cable box then turn off cable box only and press OK/Select button or menu button (depends on cable box) on remote.Look at the inband status SNR and the OOB (out of band) status SNR and AGC (auto gain control)it will tell you your signal strength good,fair,poor,or invalid so your can troubleshoot your connections.""",positive
I needed to add and cable drop for my dock and I was worried about the drop in power to my cable modem.  The monster work great.  All the tvs are working and the cable modem is still fast.,positive
It does its job gold and 2gig 4 way great speed I still use it . . .. . . .,positive
Over priced and the signal loss and picture quaility is no better then when using the low cost units. Save your money.,neutral
Item works good.. Works even better when connected to another splitter that works in the 2 ghz range. I noticed that when I used a lower end splitter that didnt support 2ghz it did not work as well. So match up all your splitters to be the same kind..,positive
Monster has always charged more for their products because they are well made and last longer than those of their competitors.  The product itself is well contructed and best in class.  The premium price reflects the quality of the product.,positive
"Yes, the price is just great. With my $25 gift certificate, I can get the thing for about $8. I just test the first disc, and it went fine for the first hour. But towards the end of the disc, I start to hear BIG  skipping/shuttering. It's just like playing mp3 on a busy computer. I hope  that I have time to test the rest of the discs today and give it a  recoomendation.",neutral

I have a small office networked with these cards.  Works fine for printer and file sharing.  Cannot get it to share online connection.  What really has me puzzled though is the fact I had two of the computers at my house networked with the same cards and they could share the connection.,positive
"Con este tipo de tarjetas de memoria he podido almacenar con rapidez fotografias de alta resoluci&oacute;n y sin ningun problema de funcionabilidad. Con respecto a usarlas para almacenar informacion de IPAQ u otro tipo de Pocket PC, tambien funcionan muy bien. Son bastante seguras para hacer copias de seguridad de la informacion de su Pocket PC.Antonio.",positive
"This is a quality product that holds up.  I've been using Viking products for a couple of years now (modems, memory, etc..) and I have had no complaints about any of their products.  Amazon's price on this 32 mb card makes it a steal!  Don't pass up on this great deal.",positive
Not much to review... if 32mb is all you need then this is the card for you.,positive
"I use this little add-on with my HP Jornada 545. And well I have nothing to say, and that is simply because there are zero issues. I just plugged it in, and the integration was seemless. No problems, whatsoever",positive
"This card does all of what the makers say, exactly, every time.  This product is flawless and high quality.",positive
"Bought since it was the cheapest, but lo! it works just fine in my Canon Elph s110.  No complaints, and that's a compliment.",positive
All compact flash memory brands are basically the same. As best I can tell they are made in 3 factories in jakarta indonesia sub contract. I would therefore buy based on price only,positive
"The product is shipped with a notice stating that installation instructions are to be seen on Viking's web site which, for me, has thus far failed to load.",negative
"Not much to say about a memory disk. Like any other types of memory cards, it basically store the same way. The price is reasonable.My advice: stick with the same storage media throughout your purchase.",positive
"I purchased it to raise my Jornada 548's memory up to 96 MB. I read elsewhere flashcards would be a must if I wanted to play mp3 on it.Well... just open the lid, insert it, and... voil&aacute;! No drivers, no special software required.A highly recommendable accessory.",positive
An excellent CF card.  Its is very fast at reading and writing data (a weakness in some CF cards) and it is very reliable.  I have yet to have one single problem with this card.  I doubt I will buy any other brand of CF card.  Viking has done a great job.,positive
I used one for a couple of weeks now.  So far I have noticed no problem.,positive
"First I bought a sandisk and after a month of use got damaged, I tryed to comunicate with them a lot, they have the worst customer service, then i gave up. then i bought this Viking like a year ago, and im still using it.",positive
Installed 128 Mb card into my iPAQ for immediate memory increase.  Works like a champ!,positive
"128M is great. but since 256M is available now at a great price, get 256M instead. 08/02/2001",positive
"A CF card is a CF card for the most part, and this card has given me absolutely no problems.  Got a good price on it here, so I got it for my new Canon S230.  Very Happy.",positive
"What a world! When we bought this memory card, it was big. You know the rest of this story! What would you use a measly 128 Mb for now? 10 pictures?",neutral
"I can't say much for or against this card.  It is not flashy or &quot;USB Enabled&quot; (does anybody ever use that feature anyway?) but it does exactly what I expected it to, at a reasonable price.",positive
"So far, the only way I have been able to obtain my rebate is to pester the rebate company for months until they finally decide I am not going to give up until I get my rebate. Not worht it. The company uses a web site called ""wheresmyrebate"" com. Do not trust them. Other than that, the card is excelent and I recomend the card, just not the company policies.",neutral
The 128 meg card by Viking provides the perfect balance of affordability and space. This card allows me to shoot over 400 1024x768 shots with my Canon Elph S110. (...),positive
I bought this with my Canon A20 and haven't looked back. Works just fine for digital photography.,positive
"I would avoid this compact flash card--  I've gone thru two, both which proved to be defective.",negative
No complaints about this card. It works just as well as any other card I've tried in my Canon S110. It holds 128 highest quality images. Good value for the money....,positive
"even though I retired the camera I bought this card for , the card is still in use. I use it for a digital picture frame that I have without any problems.  the price was right too.",positive
I use this card with a Canon G1 camera.  Haven't had a single problem.  Stores 50 or so raw images.  Downloads are fast and haven't had a single reliability issue.  I like compactflash cards as they are much more sturdier and Viking Components did well on this one.I recommend this card for anyone who has a digital comera that takes compactflash cards,positive
"I purchased this card for my HP Jornada 548.  It was easy to install and made an immediate, detectable difference in the operating speed of my machine.The next one I buy is for my Nixon Coolpix 990.",positive
"Makes the new digital camera (a Canon Powershot A20) fully functional. Set at small resolution/super-fine definition, this card gives me 577 photos!Functions smoothly with both camera and card reader.A great deal for the price!",positive
"This card is just the right size for weekend trips.  It holds more than enough pictures.  I have never had any trouble with it, in fact I bought two!",positive
"This is a very good CF card, which also is fast. There exists some cheaper cards on the market but I know some of them are slower. Using the card in a high-resolution digital camera you don't want a too slow card that will make you wait for the image to be stored before you can take next image.There is only one thing you need to consider before you buy this card: Is it big enough?",positive
"I have a Canon Powershot S-10 digital camera (2.1 MP).  With my Viking 128 MB compact flash card, I can store 212 digital photos at high resolution! Compact Flash memory is often $1 per MB, but this was much less (including the rebate from Viking, which I got as promised).  Overall, a good deal for a good product.",positive
1 year and still working! - more than I can say for some other brands.,positive
"I used this card for my Canon S10 camera, and just love it.  The write and read time are as comparable with the orginal Canon memory and I also compare the performance with my Simple Tech 64MB CF Card and it is as good as the Simple Tech card.  No problem with it, and loving it.",positive
"I installed this card in my Jornada 690, and its about twice as fast as my old Compact Flash card.  It detects itself faster without much delay,etc..  I would not recommend putting startup items on the card, and expecting them to load as fast as internal RAM (I tried that, and the card could not compete with internal RAM). But hence for a CF card this is as fast as I've used!  I recommend.",positive
"I've used this card for months, and have yet to be disappointed. It works well in both my Kodak and Nikon digital cameras. I have never felt that it was too slow or unreliable. I'd buy again.",positive
I purchased this compactflash card to use with my Nikon Coolpix 995.  I've used it extensively and I cannot detect a difference in performance with a compactflash card for which I spent nearly twice as much. It works great and it's cheap. What's not to love about it?,positive
I use this card on my Canon Powershot S300 digital camera and it works flawlessly. The price is right also!,positive
nothing else is important!,positive
"I got this CF card for my Nikon Coolpix 885 and it works flawlessly.  It is really good to have a card that can store hundreds of digital shots.No technical problems. No compliance issues. Great price. Viking CF cards always live up to their expectations.Overall, I am very satisfied with this product.",positive
"Easily installed in my PDA, this little chip lets me store hours' worth of MP3s for portable listening.I can also use it in my digicam to store hundreds of photos at a time. Voila! No more lugging a PC or PDA every time I plan to take pictures.",positive
Plenty of space and never had any problems.,positive
You can't ask for anything more than it remain completely reliable and uneventful.,positive
"I recently purchased a Hewlett Packard Digital Camera that came with a 4 mb flash card.  The Vikings 128 mb flashcard is great.  At Xmas I took 52 pictures and still had 167 pictures available to take on the card.  I recommend this card to anyone who, like myself loves to take pictures.",positive
"I really couldn't have asked for more or better performance, and this seems to be the best price/Meg for most Flash memory products.",positive
"I'm using this card in my Canon S330 digital camera... gives me 200 photos on average quality, and 128 photos in highest quality.  Can't complain!  It's writes and reads plenty fast and I've had no problems with it whatsoever!  Highly recommended!",positive
"I bought this CFC for my PDA and now I have the posibility to carry as much documents, music, photographs, etc as I want.",positive
"I use CompactFlash for some of my digital cameras, and I've become a fan of the Viking brand. However, I still buy by the dollar-per-meg calculation. Currently, this number should always be less than 1. It is curious that the prices on these cards may fluctuate by as much as 20% in one day! I suggest you find the card you want and track it a while.",positive
"I still can't believe a 128MB CF card cost me only.. This is a very high quality product looks and performance wise not to mention the ease of usage. If you have a Zip drive, this product acts just like a zip drive. Man, this baby rocks with my Canon A20 digicam.",positive
I have had no problem with this card.  I would recommend it for someone who needs a little exta space.  I keep it plugged in just to provide that extra bit of space and temporary back up.,positive
This little card has been wonderful!  It works with my San Disk Imagemate reader and I've been enjoying trouble free service since purchase!,positive
Bottom line: this is a great card (even with the aforementioned MB-that-isn't-MB) and a great deal. Using it with my camera right now and simply couldn't imagine not having it. Hundreds of pictures at a reasonable price (that keeps dropping) -- what else is there? Buy it now!,positive
"- I use it with &gt; 3 MP Canon S30 and it gives me 76 pictures.- It works reliably and I have not seen any issues with both my cards.- With the 256 MB card I know I will run out of battery before I fill the CF card...so, I see the 128 MB as the optimum card size.",positive
"What can be said about a memory card.  It works very well, this is my third, the oldest one is almost 3 years and working with no problems.  An added bonus is it comes in a little plactic box which makes it safer for storage in the camera bag.  The rabate makes it very inexpensive too!I also have the Viking card reader for a laptop, was only $9 and makes transfering pictures to computer no effort at all!",positive
"I bought this one in 2004 (7 years ago). I still use it every week, and it works just like it did on Day 1.",positive
Great bargain!!  Easy to use and install.  No problems.  Great product! My Jornada thanked me!,positive
I was really happy with the Viking CF cards till I got a Lexar. It is noticabilly faster. With the Cannon that matters cause the shutter is already kinda slow. I recomend you check out the Lexar.,neutral
Works well with my nikon.  Sandisk readers also are useful if you transfer or back up data.  So small I always have it with me.,positive
"What is there to say?  Great card for increasing your storage capacity.  No problems whatsoever.  The only question is, as cheap as these cards are getting, why not go ahead and spring for the 64 or 128 card?",positive
"I have been buying Viking in both SmartMedia and CompactFlash itinerations for the last 2 years. I've never had a problem and I find they are priced more competitively than the other leading brand. However, I always buy by the dollar-per-meg calculation, and currently this number should always be less than 1. Also, if you're looking to save $, shop the same card for a week or two and you might see some serious price fluctuations.",positive
"I've ordered three of these things.  They work great.  Never had any problems.  They come with a nice plastic case that is perfect for storing the cards in my camera bag.Update:I think I own about six of these by now (12/2003).  Still, no problems.",positive
"I own the Ricoh RDC5000 digital camera, and I have been using an eight megabyte card. I was constantly having to download after only nine pictures at the higher resolutions. The 32 megabyte card quadruples my output with a minimum cost. I have just ordered another one so that I will have plenty of memory for my vacation.",positive
This is a great tapes. I bought another package because of the quality.,positive
"Nothing special here, but it appears that Amazon doesn't sell VHS themselves. Right price point.",positive
"The clarity is so clear. I thought there would be something wrong with the picture, but there was no vertical rolling, no color bleeding, and no dark spots. The colors were soooo vivid, I thought I was watching the actual show. Of course in a recorder material, the picture quality was worse than that of seeing it right infront of you. There was only like a 0.000001% quality degrading. You won't even recognize it. It is like HDTV.",positive
"These are great batteries for us, we use them in our Canon SX 160 cameras (2).  We are amazed at how many shots they give us, far more than any recharageable battery that we have used in our other Canon cameras (A3100 and SX40).",positive
The battery you need for all of your digital things. It's lighter than conventional batteries and last much longer as well.,positive
I have a controller that requires this type of battery.  I used the 4X batteries and they ran for 21 playing hours.  I have 16 playing hours currently on these 9X batteries and they show no signs of slowing down!,positive
"These are great batteries.  I had one set in Nikon F4s and used them for many trips and it is still going and going f0r four years alrady.  Light weight (1/3 the weight and at least 5+ times the power than the Alkaline batteries.  Best of the all, it will not dmage your camera while storing.  A true &quot;everyready&quot;!  HIghtly recommended.",positive
Works well and has lasted over a year on an outdoor temperature transmitter. I read that Lithium batteries keep their voltage better in cold temps than do Alkaline batteries.,positive
This is the battery to buy for use in those applications where you want to &#34;set it and forget it.&#34; Or where you don't want to be having to change batteries at inopportune moments (like a digital camera). My particular use is for a indoor/outdoor digital thermometer. The outdoor sending unit is subjected to heat extremes and need to function even in subzero temps.These batteries will last several years there with no problem. Easily woth the extra money.,positive
They don't last half as long for me as they are advertised which is all i can say. I have used them in digital cameras and dslr camera equipment.,negative
"Bought these for their long life.  I use them in my thermostat and CO2 detector.  If there is a better battery out there, I'd like to see it.  To me, these are the best.",positive
"Very happy with this order and the way packed and arrived ontime, used them in holiday wreath..They were good because lasted whole holiday season running nightly...Will do business with them again in heart beat.ThanksTodd",positive
"I love the Garmin eMap.  It does everything I ever wanted in a GPS.  You can even get software downloads from Garmin's web site.  There are many accessories available, and you will probably want them all!  The complete outfit is kind of pricey.  If you want to upload maps you will need a separate data card, you cannot load maps into the stock unit.  Also, it eats a TON of batteries!",positive
"An executive plaything that can't do what a buyer wouldexpect. Garmin.s mapsouce products are oudated, inaccurate, andoverpriced. The etrex ... does all that this unit can do and it ishalf the price. Remenber keep it simple stupid.",negative
"Garmin has a winner here - good screen, easy to use, and the maps are first rate.  Battery life is pretty amazing, the lock-on time is less than a minute, and it tracks well even in cars and aircraft.",positive
"The only complaint I have is that it goes through batteries fairly quickly.  I find that batteries will last about 4 hours which is not good if I take a 6 hour trip.  Yes, I know I can bring more batteries. :)",positive
i-we- find this the best easiestbest priced gps out there.. about idiot proof.. we have hunters that get lost goin to the truck for beer.. not any more.....,positive
"I have had this one for ages, and it is still working like a champ. Guided me around the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico, and into and back from a lot of hiking in the woods. Waterproof and bulletproof.",positive
"This little gadget introduced me to the world of GPS, and I've been hooked ever since.  This unit is very dependable and good for collecting data and building waypoints.  A good solid product.",positive
For my first GPS I selected the Garmin eTrex. Easy to use to mark waypoints and find them later. Have not had to use it in the dark yet. Setting up routes is nice just to know the distance between two points. I recommend this to anyone who needs something lightweight and simple.,positive
"I bought this unit to take with me deer hunting. It did not track the satellites initially so I returned it. I had the same difficulty with the second unit. The seller couldn't explain why both malfunctioned so I just got my money back.  My advice is to take 2 AA batteries with you, open the package, install them and test the unit before you leave the parking lot. I guess there are no satellites over Gray, Georgia.",negative
This is my first GPS unit and I bought it for the price and the reviews. It really is a great buy. Does what it's suppose to do. I am a novice hiker. I use this so at the very least if I get lost I will be able to find myself back to my car!  Great buy for the price. Just don't forget to mark key waypoints so you could trackback.,positive
"Although it took a while for me to get the device to pick up the satellites, once I did it was all it promises to be.  This one is great because it fits in your pocket",positive
"Great GPS for the price.  Went mountain biking and hiking and it worked great!!  The manual was rather complicated, and don't buy the instructional video, it's worthless.",positive
"I bought this device for my brother who likes to hike and fish.  Given the reasonable price I thought it would be a nice introductory GPS device.  If your needs are simple and you don't need map functions, this would be a good choice as a starter unit until you decide if you want to invest in a more feature-rich GPS unit.Tom",positive
"This unit works as they say. I only need it for location coordinates and it works great. I tried setting markers and waypoints to find my way back to a starting point, but the unit seemed to want me to return in a straighter line vs the one I walked. Many other features I have yet to use and may not need as I only need a location point. For the money, I got what I paid for.",positive
"This doesn't have many bells and whistles.  But if you can get a lattitude and longitude for what you want to find, it will take you to within 50' or so of it.  If you want to know where you were (within about 50'), it will do the trick.  I am a land surveyor, and have used this in the woods a lot to get in the neighborhood of something I'm looking for.  Tough, simple receiver.",positive
WHO would put a hole (presumably to equalize pressure?) in the back of a portable GPS?  IPX7 no way.  what did garmin expect would happen if a warm GPS fell into cold water?  very first time it went 4&#34; into water for no more than five seconds it sucked water in and never would turn on again.  a simple internal bladder is all it would take.  this thing is garbage if you need it any where near water.,negative
"I highly recommend NOT getting this unit. The Garmin unit doesn't work well enough to do anything with. I'm up high on a mountain with great sky coverage, lots of satellite lock in, awful inaccuracy. Waste of money.",negative
Nothing bad to say about it since it works just as what it's suppose to.,positive
"I buy spindle after spindle after spindle of these, and they're great. I never burn coasters (that is, end up with a CD that didnt burn correctly and cant be used for anything except my chai mug), and I never have trouble playing them elsewhere. Every other brand I've ever tried has had at least one of those problems. Memorex has always been problem-free.",positive
"These are full length (700 MB) disks that are able to take advantage of today's faster CD burners (my 24X Yamaha burns a full one in &lt;3 mins!). The price per disk can't be bettered, and the quality of the first 50 I got was 100% perfection. Sweet!",positive
Last a long time the CD did mot shed . .. . . . . . . . . .,positive
THESE BLANKS ARE AFFORDABLE &amp; RELIABLE. I PRICED AROUND (EVEN WENT TO BEST BUY) &amp; THEY DON'T BEAT THIS PRICE. JUST RECEIVED MY ORDER OF 50 (WITH FREE SHIPPING) &amp; CAN'T WAIT TO START USING THEM. I BORROWED SOME FROM BY BROTHER-IN-LAW &amp; CAN REPORT I'VE HAD NO ERRORS. WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANY 'BURNER'.....,positive
"Popped it in my Kodak 3600, turned it on and started taking pics.  Works just fine.  At the low setting (900x600), the card gives me over 700 picsOther people may have had issues with San Disk cards being read in a Kodak but since my camera was new enough, it already had the firmware of 1.30 which is what Kodak recommended.",positive
"This works fine for me. The only reason I won't give it a five is because it does not exceed expectations, but it certainly meets all of my expectations.",positive
"I was on a trip to Europe this summer.  Although I already had two 64 MB SanDisk CompactFlash cards, I bought the 128 MB when I upgraded to the Canon G1.  In a minimally compressed mode the Canon can store 72 images on the SanDisk 128 MB card.  I actually filled all my cards with vacation photos!  Glad I made the purchase.  This card has worked flawlessly for me and the price is very reasonable.",positive
"This San Disk 128 MB Compact Flash a God Send for my digital camera; I can store over 200 very high quality photos with my Canon A-20 (400+ very good quality and 600 good Quality), Also this is a great price I paid a lot more at a photo store for a 64MB than this, and this 128 holds twice as much (of course). Amazon does it again.",positive
"I have bought all of my recently purchased digital camera stuff here.  So far, everything works great.  I would like to buy a card reader, but the reviews are scary -- especially the cards getting damaged by the reader.  I wrote to SanDisk about this problem, but have heard nothing back.  I hope more purchasers will write additional reviews to let us know about the card damage problem",negative
There are currently NO drivers available for this product for Windows XP.The SanDisk web site simply says &quot;this device is not supported in Windows XP&quot;  There is no promise for creation of new Windows XP drivers.,negative
"Tried the SanDisk reader on a new HP and the computer would not find it.  Next tried in on a brand new Gateway 750 MHz, Windows '98.  This computer  does not like it.  The reader constantly locks up the entire computer.  Found the serial cable to be much more reliable than this horrible piece of  equipment.",negative
This isn't really a review.  I just want to point out that you have a typo.  You have this item listed for $300?!?!  Wow!  This has got to be SOME mouse!,positive
"These are the best trackballs around.They are better than the later models since the optical sphere rides on bearings sothe pointer traction is super smooth.T-CH11, T-BB13, T-CL13 all have the same ball bearings.These are the 3 supporting ball bearings for the big red (with black dots) optical sphereI found that the size of each of the three bearings is 1.7 mm.Replacement bearings can be found online at bocabearings dot com.",positive
"nice ergonomic shape, making use intuitive.  I got it because of the scrolling capability and got a nice comfy tool.  all the controls are smooth and the movements are smooth---a far cry from my old trackball which necessated backing and filling to get the pointer to go anywhere with accuracy.  it even has noticeable mileage on it, making its performance all the more noteworthy.",positive
I like Logitech products and this was no disappointment. It worked well. Unfortunately I had trouble learning to move the marble with my thumb and ended up going back to my original marble with the marble in the middle. I am sure that younger unarthritic people will love the ease of use with this particular marble wheel mouse.,positive
"Honestly, I expected much more from wireless headphones.These headphones disappointed me so much that I had toreturn the product back to the store the very next day.Static interference occuring every 20 seconds was the only reasonwhy I didn't like them. Everything else was just ok.The headset itself fit perfectly and was very convenient.Overall - 1 star for bad reception.Would recommend Panasonic RPHT 355 headphones for their 16.4 ft (5 m.) long cord. That's what I use now. ASIN: B00004TZJI",negative
"Not sure about range - I go outside with them but can't go real far.  Receiver is sitting on the tv.  I've had them for some time.  Only complaint I have is that the AAA Rechargeable batteries I have won't work in them.  I haven't tried lithium batteries, but I plan to.  For the price, they do a pretty good job.",positive
"This Product have a great design, good sound in my CD-Player and TV... but in my DVD Player I get some static, the same in the Home Theather, I think don't respond good in High Quality Frequence... the reception is good in  all the room, bad and good in the rest of the house...

"Got my 1st VCR in 1979. JVC. $2000. Tapes were around $20 then. Needless to say, I have gone thru many different units.This a good unit. Nice and simple. I've used various similiar Panasonic models for years, but, these machines are getting old, and you can't expect them to last for many more years.",neutral
"I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.",positive
"I can't recommend this VCR. The sound of the VCR's motor is very loud and is annoying. Also, it can not record in the LP mode. LP delivers a much better picture than the EP mode.",positive
"until it broke.  The repair technician said the laser pickups were made by Samsung, and a steady stream have been coming in for repair.  It would cost (...)to replace, so I might as well buy another player.  I've had the unit for almost a year now.  Great picture, useful zoom for those too-wide movies, and adequate remote.",positive
"The toshiba SD 1200 was the first DVD I aquired for over two years ago.Two years later I dont regret for a second for buying it. It's been flawless since the day I set it up.

In the set up, recognition of movies and over all execution.I recomend it to anyone who is planning to buy a DVD.",positive
"I was shocked to find a high quality name brand player at this price with DTS out, component video out, and lots of other bells and whistles (zoom, expanded black level, etc.).  It compares very favorably with my 1 year old+ Pioneer 414, which cost me $100 more.  Its ease of use and features  had me banish the Pioneer to my bedroom!",positive
Just wanted to counter the strangely negative review of this fine prouct for &quot;beeping&quot;. It only beeps for users who have not read the manual and learned how to use their product.,positive
"I installed this in addition to the existing 10GB drive on my 3 year old computer.

"What else could you ask for... Throw it into a system, and bammo... extra space.",positive
"I've had the D-360L for around 6 months now and overall, it's functioned flawlessly.  The pictures are crisp, with remarkable detail.  I do have one critisism however, the battery life is appalling  :(  This thing EATS  batteries!  I have found that not using the LCD display helps a little  though.  All in all, a great little camera for a good price.  Just make  sure you have plenty of spare batteries with you on your trips (or buys  some rechargables).",positive
I love it!.  Easy easy easy to use and the picture quality is quite good.  I just wish I could figure out how to use the digital zoom.  The menu option could be easier to navigate.The battery life is very good and the picture capacity is good.All in all I am quite pleased with it and glad I bought it.,positive
"I've purchased three of these for family- all beginners with the digitals. Everyone still has (and uses) their camera. They are compact and light. Great for emailing pictures.Use the &quot;high quality&quot; HQ setting for the ones you want to print. Prints look good, but a good printer helps. Be sure to browse the manual, but once you brush up, it's easy and fun.",positive
One of the best camerias that are super! I say buy it. Yes the amazon prediction is correct. a 4.5. HAve the cash than buy it,positive
"This is an outstanding digital camera - you will not be dissapointed!Strengths: *Excellent picture quality *Intuitive user interface and menus *Can use as point &amp; shoot, or can tweak options like ISO and flash speed for more advanced use *Included Smart Card holds from 32-122 imagesWeaknesses: *Serial port download of images is super-slow (although getting the USB smart card reader via rebate will solve that problem) *No AC adapter or rechargable batteries included",positive
"D460Z is very unlike the 450Z and it is made of cheap plastic.  Ofcourse, the menu has improved but the overall quality has declined.  I noticed the following:1.  Camera body is made of cheap plastic 2.  The zoom lens makes an annoying noise when you turn the camera on! 3.  Price is falling  down like a rock....",neutral
"I was very happy with this camera, it has nice features, nice quality  photos for the price, however - do not buy the SanDisk reader as you may  run into problems.  Found the rechargeable batteries to work the best with  this camera - will save you a lot of money!",positive
I just can recommend this camera for everybody.It's simple to use and makes good quality pictures.If you are professional you can buy something more advanced... But for everage people this camera is very good,positive
"snapshooter convenience, professional level images. easy to use in default, amazingly flexible(complicated) when you delve into features. lens seems a little fragile when extended, but linked optical/digital zoom with  one button improves greatly on c-2020, which i also have. this is my 5th  digital, and i love it. with large-gig laptop, and pcmcia card adapter,  it's easier than floppies.",positive
"The initial reviews for this camera said it was tooo complicated for the average user.  Horsehockey.  I love this camera, my 9 year old can use it. The pictures are incredible..I'd certainly NOT get anything cheaper if I was starting out, the price has come down so much.  There are now clearly better cameras but for the novice this is excellent.  Great flash.Buy more memory, it's cheap.",positive
"It's ok, but can't watch VCDs with it.",neutral
"I have had absolutly no troubles with this dvd player.  It has good subtitles and alot of features expecially for under 200$ new.Hook it up with a digital line into a good reciver and you got awsome picture quality, with awsome sound.Set-up was very easy, just plug it into the receiver and power and your ready for DVD's.",positive
This is one sweet device! This is the best value for your money in a PDA.  Its far more economical than the Vx or even V for that matter. I personally  like the looks of the IIIxe over that of the V series especially since the  IIIxe is jet black(versus the onlder III models with the gray case). The  case also seems more rugged and sturdy than the Visor series. Buy this!,positive
I have owned this PALM for about a month and it is very easy to use and very helpful. The computer software that comes with it is great and a must for the sales person or busy exec. that needs organization (me) You won't go wrong buying this PALM and for the price it is a steal!,positive
"For the price point, you cannot beat this model. It has everything you need, and a whopping 8MB of RAM to boot! It's so intuitive and easy to use. It's a true road warrior as well, coming through  with flying colors  travelling through 3 continents. Palm outdid themselves with the IIIxe!  Bravo!",positive
"I loved this product. It kept me organized and on-time. Syncing was a breeze. And as always with me, the price was right. I used this until I upgraded to the Palm Z99. It would have been nice if the screen was backlit but that's one of the reasons I upgraded to the Z99.",positive
It is a great feeling to carry around your palm and always have  information in your pocket.  I use mine with avantgo.com to always have  something to read.  I load a few ebooks on.  I also have it linked to my  Micorsoft Money applications so I can always keep track of my finances.  How great are these things!  Pick one up!,positive
"I bought this device at least six or seven years ago.  I should have shorted the crap out of Palm when I had a chance.  When the batteries (two AAA) are drained, you will lose all your data in the device!!!  Not only that, the lack of back light makes it difficult to read in an airplane, a dark conference room or in a dark restaurant.This device along with a very nice leather case will be donated to charity.",negative
This thing is a dinosaur at this point. Are they even selling it? I wouldn't waste my money on it.,negative
I bought a Viser as my first PDA and immediately fell in love with the whole handheld thing! Within a year I decided to upgrade to add more memory and to explore color and Oh Wow!!!!!!!! What a difference! Now I wouldn't dream of going back to grayscale!!!!!!! My only wish is that it had the color intensity of the Handspring Prism and the wireless connectivity of the Palm VIIx. The Palm IIIc is a great product!,positive
"Although this keyboard shows up in the search list for Palm M100s, Palm insists that the curved shape of the M100's bottom is not compatible with standard III keyboards, folding or otherwise.",positive
"great item. easy to use, well designed.  well worth the price",positive
Keyboard was &#34;neat&#34; but I could not get it to operate with the Palm pilot which should have been returned.,neutral
I was very pleased with this product. It worked beautifully.Unfortunately it could not be used with newer PDA's.,positive
I bought this keyboard about a month after I bought my Palm Vx. It's been one of the best investments I've made for my Palm. It's so much easier than the graffiti or the onscreen keyboard. It feels more natural and comfortable and is great for taking notes. A must have for any Palm V or Vx owner who uses it for any kind of writing.,positive
"I am still a Palm Vx user and I just got the keyboard. It really makes data entry much more efficient. I can write my e-mails on my Palm now! Make sure you get a Palm brand keyboard, the imitations might not be so good as stated in other reviews. No problems with setup. The keyboard is very light as well. I would definitely recommend it. And I got it for a very very reasonable price from amazon.com merchant.",positive
"Title says it all. With so many folks either recording their own play lists and downloading their music, any player without the capability to play them is obsolete.",negative
"This CD Player excedes my expectations,the sound and ease of control is excellent. It is like having your own juked box at home. I would definitely recommend this product to others.",positive
"Love the fact that the changer can store up to 300 compact discs.  I am currently a third of the way there.  MostlyI play it on random mode.  Recently random mode does not work as well as it did compared to when I first got it.The player is telling me ""no disc"" when I know I have a disc in the slot.  If someone out there can help me, pleaselet me know.",positive
I had read the reviews prior to purchasing and I must say they were very accurate. Excellent in all catergories except for the all black and hard to see remote.I knew about that before I bought it. I like it better that the Sony 300 that failed after eight light use years. The Pioneer is faster and sounds better.I am pleased with the equipment and my first buying experience with Amazon.,positive
"Broke three of my CD's the first day I owned it. I blame myself for buying 1990's technology when I should have invested in MP3 / Ipod technology (which I did). CD's and CD changers like this are dead technologies. Sorry, but that's the way it is.Amazon compensated me with a $20.00 credit for the broken CD's, so they certainly have done their part. I love Amazon.com.",negative
"I have had this for about a month now.  I must say, for the price it isn't that bad.  It has a lot of settings that you would need to constantly play with because of all the choices and some spl setting you might want to set for some movies, regular channels etc..All in all it does the job.",positive
"I've been using this camera for years now doing digital 360 photography.What makes this camera great is the len(s) you can get (wide angle & fish eye) which lets you make 360 degree panoramas with the help of software like VRToolbox, and pano-head from Kaidan.Sean B. Halliday[...]",positive
"Life is so much better ever since I got my Nomad II here in Japan...I[paid a lot for] it in Misawa Air Force Base, but the results compensate for any cash.  The only drawback, surfing is about the only place I can't take this awesome player.  This is a must!",positive
I use this tripod with 7th &amp; 8th grade students using a digital camcorder to make i-movies.  It's held up well and I'm planning on purchasing another so they don't need to argue over who's turn it is to use it.  Very easy to use.  The built in level bubble is a plus.  Very adaptable height wise.,positive
"Tripods should be reliable, inexpensive (c'mon, it's a tripod) sturdy, and easy to set up... this 'pod offers it all. An attractive little number, it is very lightweight, only 30 or so dollars, a snap to set up, and very sturdy...especially in this &quot;snap and go&quot; world... a good cheap buy!",positive
This is a manual flash and I use this as my background lighting. Slow on recycle but it works for me as I intended so I gave a 5. I have a remote trigger I use with this for fill light especially on urban or architectural shots.,positive
"When I received the flash, I was disappointed to discover that the seller had accidentally left batteries in the flash, which had badly corroded, rendering the flash unusable. However, I contacted the seller, and he immediately refunded my payment, no fuss at all. While this purchase didn't work out how I wanted, I would happily purchase from him again.",neutral
Bought this flash in a camera store for my pentax asahi k-1000 and I absolutely love it !!! Very highly recommended,positive
"I have been using this flash for couple of years.  It is a real work horse.  Like other flashes in this time period, it makes high pitch noise as it recharges.The shoe mount voltage is enough to fry the modern digital body - you would either need a shoe mount adapter or remote trigger.  I use two flashes using cactus 4 remote trigger.",positive
"Ummmmm, I have been using an old Vivitar 283 from the 1980s on my Lumix G1 digital camera and it seems to work just fine.When people talk about ""300 volts"" and ""frying the camera"" -- if I had to worry about this, would it have already happened?",positive
"This is what you need if you use a Palm and have a USB Mac (blue G3, G4, or iMac).  Works flawlessly, unlike the first two 3rd party solutions  (Belkin and a no-name) I tried to use.  The secret is at least partly the  driver - install the latest Mac software from [...] and you should  have no problem.Heartily recommended!",positive
"Constructed of shock-absorbent, water resistant neoprene material - you can take it anywhere your lifestyle takes you!  Features include a window slot for a driver's license or I.D., an additional pocket and a stylus  holder.  The PalmGlove Neoprene Case is designed exclusively for Palm, Inc.  by Body Glove the renowned maker's of wetsuits. This thing is more stylish  than those leather packs, and more usable...",positive
"You cannot beat this case.  I have it to hold my Palm IIIxe.  The case is made out of the same material that wet suits are made out of.  The case is totally shock proof, and splash proof.  If you do not yet own a case for  your Palm organizer, then this is definately the one to get.  Can't beat  the price either.",positive
"There is nothing spectacular about this case, but then again it has no serious flaws either.  It is relatively inexpensive, does its job, and cleans easily (even baby spitup).  I've given several away to colleagues and clients and they have all been happy with them.",positive
It's truly lovely to look at.  But useful?  No don't think so.  Why?  Awkward.  Have to unzip to get to palm; zip back up to put palm away.  Alot of zip/unzipping if you ask me.  If you don't use your palm often it's nice  but if it's an essential part of your life then it's aggravating to have to  deal with this case.,neutral
"Great case - however doesn't work for Palm VIIx, which doesn't even fit into the case. Also didn't work for my wife's Handspring Visor, which fit but was turned on everytime the case was zippered up.",negative
"It's just great.  It's waterproof, good design and shock resistant.  My only comments are that it should have a belt clip.  That would be nice.  I like how it has room for other stuff.  I keep my Grafiti reference card in the pocket so that I can reference when needed.",positive
"Get rid of your mouse pads and never pull out a pencil eraser again to clean the trackbars inside your mouse.I thought that an optical mouse would still need a few more years development to be viable, but you can't get any better than this.  I must disagree that this isn't the mouse for games.  I have never had smoother performance.I can't wait for the wireless optical.",positive
I prefer the logitech optical mouse I use at work.  Logitech is lighter and feel better.,negative
Browsing through my old orders today and saw this mouse. I got this in 2001 and have used it almost all of this time. Works as well today as when new. I have gone through at least a dozen mice roller balls and track pads on various computers but this one is always with my main computer ( been through more than a few computers also). Highly recommended.,positive
"I was skeptical on whether an optical mouse would have any benefit over the traditional track ball.  I was very pleasantly surprised!  I am running Windows2000, which instantly and without reboot, recognized the mouse.  It  is the four-wheel-drive of mice.  I have ordered one for all my systems!",positive
"This has to be one of the greatest innovations for the PC.  I love this  mouse and cringe at the though of going back to a weel mouse.  This will be  the standard very soon, so why not upgrade now, I know that your weel mouse  is all dusty and not accurate anyway, toss it out the window and pick up  your optical mouse!",positive
"I like how it glowsI like how its mowsIts doesnt get jammedbut its so big like a ram.At first it seems quite quicker,then the thrill level falls,Im back to my old roller/clicker,its more agile and small.",neutral
"This is the real mouse to have. I bought (and reviewed) the bigger Explorer, but found too many faults with it. This mouse is the right size, has the right feel, and responds flawlessly to input on almost any surface. The extra (programmable) buttons work without getting in the way. The red glow is still cool without being as bright as the Explorer's near-lighthouse luminescence. One thing for sure: optical mice are here to stay.",positive
"It took about 4 reboots for it to finaly work - which I shouldn't have to do with a USB device.  I've put in USB scanners and such with less work.  Still - I'm happy with it.  Works great.  I went from a trackball marble to  this IntelliMouse - I'm not yet sure which I like better, but I think it  will work better for games and photoshop. :)",positive
"I bought two other optical mouses (mice?) before this one, and I can tell you this is the best.  It has a totally different feel than the other two--immediately I noticed it is a more &quot;solid&quot; product.  The others were a little more inexpensive, perhaps, but this is well worth a couple extra dollars.",positive
* Easy installation.  USB or PS/2.* Very smooth and accurate pointing.* Scroll wheel has less resistance than original Intellimouse.* Comfortable while using.* Made of the non-shiny  material used in Microsoft's OEM mice.  Resists build-up of  &quot;mouse-crud.&quot;* Light-weight and manuverable.  This mouse is  much lighter than the original Intellimouse.* The red light under the  &quot;Microsoft&quot; logo looks awesome!  Visually stimulating.,positive
Really compact and nice case for it. Focuses easily and clearly. I like this one better than the higher power ones.,positive
"I am not a binocular aficionado, but needed something for general hiking and hunting activities. I would guess that there are others out there that offer a clearer and brighter picture, but these are great for my needs, especially for $13!",positive
This was a birthday present for my 9 year old and we absolutely love them. We use them when we go fishing or other outdoor activities and they are great.,positive
"Highly recommend these to anyone, once adjusted piteousl properly they are crisp and clear to their recommended distance! Great for hunting or watching other things outdoors, I use them when we do law scenarios in my criminal Justice class and they work great!",positive
"I don't understand how these get more than one star.They are poorly constructed and I couldn't get them to focus.Believe me, I'm not a binocular snob, these are crap. The knob sticks, they feel cheap and the image is poor.They should be putting these in cereal boxes.  Seriously, they are not worth the effort of ordering and carrying around your neck.I sent them back.",negative
This is very good for kids but the adjustable viewing side came our within a month because of poor adhesive quality.,negative
"At 50 yards with color-changing targets, these get the job done.  But anything beyond 50 yards, you are going to want something with higher power.  Otherwise good value, and solid construction.",positive
The binoculars were well constructed and suited my 10 year old grandson.  He is very happy with the product. Good purchase!,positive
I was looking for a pair of binoculars just to be able to look at the birds and animals closer. I decided on this repair because of the price and good reviews. It's a good pair for the money and works well for what I got them for.,positive
"Pros:-- Very compact-- Solid feel-- Easy to hold-- 16x is pretty powerful!Cons:-- Too hard to hold steady-- Poor performance in low light-- It was impossible for me to focus both eyes at the same time, and adjust the interpupilary distance.I returned these the day after I got them.",neutral
"Bought this one because my Simmons binoculars had a broken hinge. It is bulkier than Simmons, but it works fine.",positive
"I purchased this pair of binoculars for less than $35, and for this price, it does a good enough job.  Compared to my Bushnell 12x25 pair, it is about a quarter size larger, and the entering light amount is less.  Therefore, although the object appears slightly more magnified, it is also dimmer.  Like all Bushnells, this pair is easy to use.",neutral
Mis binoculares han sido lo m&aacute;ximo. Los he llevado al campo y se comportan muy bien. El env&iacute;o fue en tiempo record y han funcionado a la perfecci&oacute;n. Los recomiendo.,positive
i bought this item to look out my 11th fl window and the binoculars didn't seem as small as they were when i got them. i never used them and now they are in a box collecting dust. i would only recommend this to children not adults. these are way too small for adults.,neutral
"Is has only 21mm lense size, make it somewhat dark to watch details from far away of concert hall. It's really small when folded (about 3in * 4in size) which makes easy carry.",neutral
No complaints so far. It's pretty clear to look through and the amount of zoom is decent enough for most applications.,positive
I find it hard to believe that these quality glasses are so inexpensively priced. These glasses have a central focus knob and roof prisms. The purchaser will not be disappointed.,positive
Bought these Bushnells for general usage.Though very inexpensive I expected alot more.Image is not clear or sharp to say the least.Blurry is a better term to use.Hate to write negative reviews but these are going back ASAP and I will spend a little more and hope for something better.Maybe I got a bad pair or returned ones or something.Not recommended in the least.,negative
BROTHER WANTED THESE FOR HIKING AND THINGS LIKE THAT THEY CAME NICELY PACKAGED AND WORKS WELL. I AM NOT A BIG USER OF STUFF LIKE THIS BUT THEY SEEM GOOD FOR PRICE AND THEY DO AS THEY SAY THEY WILL. HAPPY WITH THEM,positive
You get what it was described above: Pocket-sized binoculars; great quality; excellent price!Recommended!!,positive
"I have shared a pair with a friend for more than a year and I must say I was amazed the first time I looked through them, having had all my experience with a [$] pair of older compact binoculars. These were nearly as good and a fraction of the price. Highly recommended.",positive
"Does what I need it to do.  If I want to look at the mosquito on some bald eagle from 100 yds away, I'll opt for something more like $2500+.Overall, know your application and what you need.  Try out fancy ocular enhancements at any fish and game store before buying and being un-satisfied.  Remember, try before you buy.This product is durable, meets specs, and good for the price paid.",positive
I bought this mainly for sporting events. My other binoculars were heavy and big. These have a belt loop on the case and can also be carried in my front pocket.,positive
We needed a pair of small binoculars for shows and other events.  These appear to be decent.  Good magnification with minimum distortion.While there are models with more magnification you have to keep in mind that with higher magnification comes more problems with distortion when you can't hold the binoculars steady.  This model is a very goo compromise.Comes with a reasonable storage case and appears to be well constructed.,positive
Bought this binocular due to the high reviews and compactness on this item as well as the binoculars are made in the US. Bushnell is a very well known company specializing in binoculars. This item is perfect for my daughter to use when going outdoors and easily to locate due to the color I purchased for her.  recommended for regular outdoor use and those that like bird watching.,positive
"The binoculars felt good and compact, just as advertised. However, mine had cloudy rings in the field of vision. I returned these and bought the Olympus 7X21 PC III Classic Binocular (from Amazon) which is also compact. Images in those are much better.",neutral
"Pretty good binocular.  Overall I like this model as it is very portable.  Maybe it is me, but I found myself having to readjust them often and it was a but annoying.  For concerts or venues like that they are easy to cary and hang around your neck without a lot of weight.",positive
I bought these binoculars and the 12X version for my GF and I for a recent U2 concert.  They worked great and for the price could not be beat.  Overall the 8X was better for seeing the stage as the 12X was more prone to movement and needed to be really steady. For people who bird watch I would recommend either as they are both very light and small,positive
Small and compact for our trip to Costa Rica. Really enjoyed bird watching with these.,positive
"This binocular is small pocket size but sturdy with bright clear view, great quality. Highly recommend.",positive
I really like the compactness of this product and serves my purpose of taking it on my kayak. Great focusing power and handy to grip and use. The folding mechanism is really fantastic. Thumbs Up!!,positive
The lens are clear and the knobs easy to adjust for focusing.  You can easily adjust the view to be sharp and bright.  It also feels rock solid and firm.  This is simply value for money!,positive
bought it for my son-in law for christmas.  he is an avid hunter and tells me this is perfect. hohoho,positive
I use it for theater and sports.  It does a good job.  Good optics.  The build is somewhat rusty and cheep.  The neck strip is way too thin.  The focusing ring provides for a reasonable distance range.  Overall - very good value for the money.  I've seen better optics and better build however at a much higher price.  For the casual user or the casual use I strongly recommend it.,positive
"These were the perfect blend as far as power vs stability. Meaning more powerful ones would need to be held really steady to avoid to much shake, and any less powerful just would not bring the subjects close enough. Very good optics, light weight, quality item for the money. Would recommend for given applications.",positive
The little boy I bought it for loves it! What a great Christmas gift to give to a 9 year old.,positive
"Maybe we got a lemon.....looking through the binoculars, you get a double image; like the left eye monocular was not pointing in the same direction as the right eye monocular.",negative
I bought these for my grandkids to play with and they love them. I actually enjoyed using them myself. Bushnell to me has always made a great product and I recommend Bushnell. Very clear scene through these and has some really good focusing. I would highly recommend these to anyone who has grandkids or just wants a great pair of binoculars.,positive
"the eyecups were too short for my eyes so you have to hold it away from your eyes and balance it in the air to see through it, cheap but in the end not usable for me...",negative
I ordered two of these to keep in the car.  One of them had to be returned as it was out of alignment and resulted in vertical double vision.  Not very good quality control.  The one that worked was fine but I gave them two stars to call attention to the bad one and warn customers to check them carefully on arrival.,negative
Good closeup and light weight. What's not to like ? Even comes with a very nice carrying case with velcro closure.,positive
I wish I'd gone for the 8x25 set instead. These provide good magnification but are difficult to hold steady enough to make out the extra detail you get. The lenses are clear and only distort a little near the edges.,neutral
"I like these binoculars and they are well made, but I think they are too strong.  I bought them to go to shows at our local theater but they are so high powered I think i would get a lower power next time.  Would be great for long distance.",positive
"We were looking to upgrade from a less powerful binocular for bird watching. My wife did not want a heavy, cumbersome pair (if binoculars can be considered a pair) hanging round her neck since she is the primary user. They are light, more powerful and can be stowed in the glovebox for ready access. Got what I asked for.",positive
"I bought these binoculars to carry in my range bag.  For that purpose, they're ideal.  They're compact, sturdy, have a decent (soft) protective case, and I have no problem seeing my targets.  The exterior has a durable, rubberized coating, so I expect these glasses to be a longtime traveling companion.  Highly recommended for the money!",positive
"Bought these for my sone for X-mas. He loves them and they feel like they are of excellent quality. The optics are great and they are easy to focus. They are somewhat small, but that makes then very compact and easy to bring to a show or something.",positive
"I was pleasantly surprised that this binocular is well constructed, small, and therefore more likely to accompany me on hikes and outings. Oh, and very affordable as well. Focus is smooth, images bright. It comes with a cheap, but functional vinyl case with belt loop and Velcro closure.  I can recommend these optics. Of course, the reader should consider that this assessment is based on the purchase price compared to features and quality received.",positive
great product - and at this price - truly an amazing buy!  you can't go wrong here.,positive
"These binoculars are great.  Good magnification, nice compact size and includes a carrying case.  What more could you ask for in an inexpensive pair of pocket binoculars?I can easily see distant license plates, they work great at sporting events / large concerts, and I have to assume they'd be great for bird watching and the like.10/10",positive
"decent quality optics at a decent price.  it always takes me a little while to get these adjusted just right so i'm not seeing double, but once i do they make looking at the moon or other stuff way neater.  glad to have them in my car for whenever i need them.",positive
"These are very poor binoculars. The optics are very low contrast, no very sharp, very difficult to focus, flare easily. The focus wheel has lots of slack and feels junky. The eye pieces have very little tolerance, frustrating to use. Pay a little more and get something you will enjoy.",negative
"Took this to the Police concert. Worked great. Comes with a case, easy to carry, magnification allows you to see properly in any lighting conditions.",positive
"You can't go wrong with these binoculars if you are looking for a set to use at sporting events or concerts.  They almost fit in your pocket, and are of good quality.  Obviously at this price point, the optics are not exactly world class, but that's OK.  They serve their intended purpose very well, at at this price if they become damaged or lost, your cost to replace is small.",positive
These work well enough and for the price I cannot complain too much. I do have issues getting to constantly show a clear picture. I bought these to help me sight my rifle's Red Dot at the range. It work well enough.,neutral
This binocular is perfect for to do camping because it is small and is to do of resistant material. The scope of lents is regular although the focus is good. Does not a professional binocular but does well his work for little money,positive
"I love it, I ordered to use at JLO concert in Miami. I did not miss any of her moves!!it was amazing how light and powerful can be. Even looking through it I took with my camara very close pictures of her.",positive
"I got the 16x32 version of these binoculars for bird watching and wow are they powerful. And you can't beat the value of $40 for a compact, powerful binocular. I was using a much cheaper brand which would not focus that well. But the optics on these Bushnell's are so much better. Highly recommended for bird watching!",positive
"Nice pair of binoculars for the money.  They have a good grip to them and let in a good amount of light. Also, pretty powerful for how compact they are. Wish they had an adjustable power setting but you can't expect that on compacts.",positive
I like these a lot. I'm a cop and needed something compact for work.  I also didn't want to break the bank for some silly binoculars.  These are a great value if your using just for short range surveillance.,positive
"I got these for my cruise to Alaska and they were fine. Can't really beat them for the price.  If you want to see something very, very close - I would say buy something better.  They were good for what I was going to use them for.",neutral
"I didn't exactly ordered this design, I ordered some other design with same specifications but received this one and it does the job all the same. Good product.",positive
It takes just a little bit of adjusting to get it focused but it is fine for me to use whenever I need it.,positive
Great little compact pair of binoculars. Works great we travel with them and bring them to concerts easy to carry and fit in pocket or purse . I recommend!,positive
"I have absolutely no complaints for these binoculars at this price. They work well and feel substantial while holding them.  I figured at the price, they'd feel cheap and plasticy - but they do feel solid)If I have any complaint, it's the placement of the strap.  It's somewhat inconvenient, but easy enough to work around.  I may just cut it off... I don't think I'll ever use it)",positive
"These little binoculars come in very handy at concerts, graduations, etc. The best thing about them is the fact that they are so compact. They fold down to a very small size and I'm able to slide them right into my camera bag and don't have to carry anything extra. They work great and are an excellent value at $20!",positive
"After being severely disappointed with several other inexpensive compact binoculars I have purchased, I thought I would give it one more try with a reputable brand name. Based on the reviews for the Bushnell 8x21, I ordered one. WOW! Extremely good optical quality for the price, very lightweight yet feel rock solid! I like these so much I bought another for my wife. Ideal for concerts and plays, and we carry them in our cars for wildlife and such.",positive
it's a $20 pair of binoculars complete with a carrying case. How can you possibly lose?  Great deal for the price.,positive
These are a great pair of binoculars for the price. they do a very good job of magnifying while not having much of the black shadow when you look through them.,positive
I purchased these binoculars to use for concerts and other performances.  They are small enough to fit in a jacket pocket or a purse.  The have enough power to see the stage even if you're far back.  They focus well.,positive
Absolutely wonderful.  Great value for the price.  They are easy to carry and powerful enough for birding and sport events. I love them. I like the fact that each side is adjustable to each eye.I'm having a wonderful time with them.,positive
"Nice, compact size with the ability to bring in a reasonably sharp image. Carrying case made it a nice gift as well.",positive
"These are a great deal. Holder is very nice, product is strong, easy to use. The adjustments were easy to make it work for me. Light enough for backpacking.",positive
"Gave these to my wife for Xmas, just in time for whale-watching season. Ha! Terrific! She can hardly be parted from them! They work just fine, survive living in her car's glove box, and were well-appreciated. Super highly recommended.See review of cooking/baking book for the best gift I've ever given.",positive
Fantastic binoculars. Was out for a week hunting and using these for spotting elk from the truck. These are so light with better optics than my compact Simmons that are my pack broncos that I am ordering a second pair to upgrade and replace my old Simmons pack binoculars. Great low light vision. Nice feel in the hand and easiest to adjust of all my binoculars,positive
"Once you get used to it, this Binocular works really good, you can't get those for that price anywhere else, even china towns sell them for 40$ or more.",positive
Used them in the Nat'l parks to see the wild life in the far distance. So glad I upped the range. They pack light and small.Perfect for travel.,positive
One of the lens' was out of line with the other side & also had a smudge or something on it that I couldn't get to come off. Returned them.,negative
"nice for small glasses, all my mother 75, can carry now on her bird walks, works fine. great price for small glasses.",positive
These are exactly what I wanted for a planned cruise.  I focused them and they are perfect.  Plus the size and folding capability will make them much easier to take on my trip.,positive
I got these for travelling around and hiking. They collapse very small (about the size of a pair of rolled up socks) and have clear lenses. They are perfect for the casual user and are at a great price. I can't be more happy.,positive
"I actually bought these binoculars for a Justin Timberlake concert my son and I were going to.  Having ok seats and not wanting to carry around a bulky, high powered pair, I purchased these binoculars.  For the price, they really, really served it's purpose. It folds nicely and fits into any pocket or since it's lightweight, you can easily put it in the pouch provided and wear it around your neck.",neutral
"Fast shipment, as advertised.  These were to replace the ones that were stolen in our backpack while on vacation.  They are exactly like the ones we had.  Work great",positive
"This is an inexpensive, fully usable pair for youth, too. But even without abusing it the eye piece feel apart after about 6 months. unfortunately it wasn't easily fixable. Hoping the replacement lasts longer.",neutral
For the price they are ok. You can focus and adjust to your eyes width. My kids used them once for a play.,positive
"These easily fit in a pocket next to a cell phone, or with the included case strap to a belt.  I used these for game viewing in Africa and was not disappointed; got me close to the action and were never a hassle to lug around or take out.  For the money, these are a great value.",positive
"could not get both eyes focused at the same time. POOR quality. Really surprised by Bushnell. I assumed the other bad reviews were just flukes, I guess not. Returned them!",negative
"These low-end binoculars are still very powerful, feel robust yet comfortable, and are highly portable. It includes a carrying case that can be looped through a belt buckle as well as a lens cleaning cloth.I definitely recommend this for someone who is looking for some cheap but quality binoculars that don't need to view objects over extreme distance.",positive
"These are a great deal for $13! I'm going to put one in each car's glove box.The collimation on mine was excellent--the images in each eye merged perfectly. This is sometimes a problem with low-priced binoculars.Some reviews complained about cheap construction. These seem fine to me, particularly considering the price. The only apparent potential weak spot is a plastic guard underneath the focus knob area.",positive
"Side was quite small for the 8x21 and cool, but the quality of the picture wasn't as good and crisp as I was expecting.I give it a 3 stars out of 5 because I thought it could have been better.I'll try some other to see if it worst than this, and if they worst, I'll boost this to 4 stars.",neutral
"while looking for an inexpensive binocular I could use at my gun club , I happened upon this productKnowing Bushnell , I was sure it would be extremely acceptable , despite the low price , I bought it.I was not wrongJust what I needed for spotting targets on the 100 and 200 yard ranges without having to walk to the target to see the results",positive
"While it's not a great binoculars, you get what you pay for.  For its price it's good.  Don't expect to see clearly through it however.  If you want to see well - get better quality glass and light gathering.",positive
"The unit is very compact and it comes with a decent pouch.  It is easy to fit in a purse or large pants pocket.  The magnification is adequate for looking at elevated architectural features, but I ended up also buying a pair of the 10 x 25 for a few bucks more.  I found the 10 x 25 pair a better value.",neutral
"These work really well for my son. They are light enough to carry around, and powerful enough that he enjoys them, and loves spying on neighbors, ha ha. Recommended item!",positive
I bought these for use at live theatre and concert events and they work perfectly for that.  They fold into a compact size that fits in pocket or purse and they have the right power.  If you want a binocular for sports or if you usually sit in the fourth balcony of large theaters or arena shows you might want to get something more powerful but for most live events you will be happy with these.,positive
"I purchased this for my 7 year old daughter. They are very powerful and are very solid feeling. I was pleasntly surprised because they were only $15. I would concider the price point to be in the ""toy"" catagory and these do not feel or act like a toy in any way!!! I would definatly buy again!",positive
"Use this to travel great distances with your eyes.  Was that an antelope sipping coffee in the house across the street?  Nooope, it's just Chuck Testa!!  But you can know for sure with these.",positive
"Great set of binoculars in such a small package... More than what I expected. Nice weight and balance. Very comfortable eye pieces. It came with a carrying case and cloth to clean the lens. I can see for miles. Can't wait to take these to a sporting event. I'll be up close and personal! No gripes, just go with it! Very pleased with this purchase.",positive
"Awesome these work awesome very impressed with this product for distance and clarity, this product is well worth the 18.00 you will not be disappointed !",positive
"We purchased these to take on a recent trip to Florida to go dolphin watching. We bought them because of the size and the power. We never went due to rain, but I'm sure these will come in handy. They are a nice size, not to small, but portable. The power is very good and you can see far.",positive
"These binoculars are a little larger than I expected, but man they work GREAT!!! They are not quite twice the size of most compact nocs, but the size difference is not a real issue, considering how well they work! They are not too heavy or too big for my needs (concerts & sports). Highly recommend!",positive
These are a very nice binocular for the money. My only objection was the instructions. It includes instructions in 10 different languages. The print was so small that I could not read them. They appear to be well made.,positive
"I returned this! I could not adjust it all. Maybe its me, but I couldnt see anything magnified, especially at night.And there weren't any instructions either..",negative
ok for the money-- but nothing really special  but do not expect anything great from these but they are ok so that is what I have ranked them.,neutral
Nice clear optics and quick/even adjusting.  Lightweight and GREAT for birding.  LOVE them! ONLY issue is they are MADE IN CHINA I would have bought one for each of my family members (10+)IF they were American made.,positive
These binoculars exceeded my expectations. I bought these to use on a trip to Yellowstone.  I needed a small and compact set since I am anyway carrying two cameras.  Of course it doesn't compare to expensive 10x50 binoculars but at this price and size I don't know of anything better.,positive
You look in the two holes and point them at something far away and they make it look closer. How do they do it?I'm reviewing binoculars...At 6:00 in the morning...I need a life.They did just what they advertised. I'm happy.,positive
"Nice feel, nice optics, easy to use, nice packaging and the service from this seller was second to none. I will use this little binocular set forever and it just might make it! I'm not easy on things either.",positive
"These are total budget binoculars.  Focus is not user friendly.  Forget about it if you wear glasses (like me).  I usually close one eye and use them as monoculars to spy on birds from my couch.  One day I'll replace them or give the to my young nephew.If you want a decent &#34;cheap&#34; pair of for kids, these work well.  If you are looking for a quality lower-price binoculars, I would spend a little more on a different pair.",neutral
You get what you pay for ... they are cheap. Lo quality glass and don't focus very well. I was unable to use them for my intended purpose but I asked too much of them (low light situation). Handed them off to my kid.,negative
"If you're looking for a pair that you don't want to lose sleep over losing or having your kid break, these are it.Having 20/15 vision, I find it's not easy keeping focus, because I have to change both the focus and the diopter on one of the lenses to bring an image into clear focus.",neutral
My wife and I purchased these binoculars primarily to use for concerts and we have been to one since we purchased them. They have met our expectations so far.  They are light and compact and work quite well.,positive
"That sounds like pride? Insulting to all Americans.  Put a flag on it! That''ll fool them dumb americans. So proud they couldn't invest in this country? They are fine for ten bucks, but what a disgusting company.  Look at a more honest dealer. Gross. Step up Bushnell, what are you &#34;proud&#34; of? Proud of your chinese built things or...?",negative
"Superb Binocular, I really like it!",positive
"I wanted a compact and lightweight binoculars, and for what they provide, this set got great reviews. In practice they are easy to use and they are useful, but not a substitute for heavy and long distance binoculars.",neutral
"This product has double image or ghost image, you send me so with this problems and now is costly for me resend this damage product to you.  How we solve this problem now.  It is 4th binocular you send me with damage or defective.  Wath happend with customer service of you for cash purchases. Please solve this problem as soon as possible.  Mr. Rolando Gomez",negative
I'm not a bird watcher but my vision is not what it used to be. These may be inexpensive but they fit my needs even when I'm 20 feet away. Easily adjustable and compact! Just what I wanted. I may get one or two more for the rest of my family.,positive
Great when I'm sitting out in the bleachers although has have been mentioned by others you have a very steady hand to keep view from bobbing.,positive
"These binoculars look like a quality product. It's nice and compact. For the size, I was surprised how far I could see through it. This product can be used in a number fun activities like hiking or shooting targets. It can also be a nice addition to a survival kit--whether it's for practical reasons or apocalypse survival. For the price, this is a great product. I highly recommend it.",positive
The Bushnell powerview 10x32 binoculars are decent for the size/price.  For reference you can read a registration plate clearly from about 50 yards away.  Youre not going to be able to see craters on the moon but they do work well for a cheap little pair of binoculars. They are fully adjustable width wise and have the focus knob that is easy to use.  Sometimes I find it easier to use just one eye with the binoculars.,neutral
"Lets face it.  For the price its not going to be a crystal clear optic.  I have tossed in in a backpack for a ball game, taken it hiking.  It lives in my B.O.B.  It serves its purpose...to bring things closer so you can see them better...yet you're not afraid to use it or lend it to someone..because its cheap.It does what I expect it to.  Period.",positive
"Pros: Compact, light, easy to carry, great priceCons: Loose eye piece easily slips out of focus, forcing user to adjust focus in two different places on the binoculars every time they view a subject.",neutral
"I bought my first binoculars. These are compact, lightweight and easy to use. Highly recommend.",positive
These binoculars are very solid and in my opinion a very good value. The lenses provide a nice image. I do not own other binoculars so I can't compare but if you are looking for a well built set of binoculars for a reasonably price I would recommend these.,positive
"well made, easy to use, effective magnification. I would recommend this especially for outdoors use, bird-watching, hiking. came with protective case, folds compactly",positive
"I bought them for a concert I was attending, they worked pretty good, I was impressed that I could still see pretty clear at the distance I was. Now I use them for birdwatch at my backyard and I like them a lot. I can see very clearly at the birds. I recommend them 100%.",positive
"I purchased these because I don't like taking my $100 binoculars to football games and rock concerts. These are perfect. The optics are a little cheap, but at $20, I think it's a steal.",positive
Good product for the money ! We recently had the opportunity to go to a Nascar race and didn't particularly want to take a set of full size binoculars. In an effort to downsize and lighten our load we purchased these compact binoculars. Nice product. Very compact.,positive
I'm sure there are higher priced/better binoculars but for this price I think u can't get much better. Awesome Bushnell quality. I take these on any trip to the outdoors. I wouldn't really go for higher magnification for hand held binoculars unless u have a very steady hand. Would buy these again,positive
"Small but very powerful, comes with a case also. I stood on my front porch and I could see the house that was 2 blocks away and it looked lie it was my next door neighbor. I am going to Vegas in April, to see Elton John and our seats are in the nose bleed section, so I should not have a problem  seeing him up close.",positive
"Well-made pair of binoculars, for a good price! Bought them to see the stage from the very last nose-bleed row at the theater, and they did the job splendidly!! May be a little too high-power if you're sitting any closer, though, as you can only follow one character at a time, even from the last row. But, otherwise, fabulous purchase...",positive
These binoculars are terrible in my opinion. I could not even use them without closing one eye. None of my family members were able to use these. I ended up returning them.,negative
the view is so good and clear and so easy to focus in and light not heavy must get you a pair,positive
"I know they were only $13, but they are poor quality. It's very hard to get a clear picture with both eyes open. Put the $13 towards a better set of binoculars and don't bother with these.",negative
"I purchased two of these because the price was right.  I have higher-quality, more expensive binoculars and these stack up quite nicely.  I was used to very large binoculars, and upon delivery thought these would be too small and compact to deliver quality results.  I was wrong.  I purchased these for boating and other full-light conditions and have been very impressed with the quality.  If I lost my original pair, I would purchase again immediately.",positive
"Not much else to say other than these are very compact, light, and have good clear glass.  I bought mine to help look at rifle targets ~100 yards out that are not so easy for me to see through a 3x rifle scope and they work fine.  Width adjustment is sufficient for those with big noggins.Nice and light to toss in the range bag, and they come with a sufficiently little carry pouch.",positive
"This is a very nice quality item, and works great. I just wished I had ordered one with more zoom power. Is going to make an excellent gift too.",positive
"It is compact and easy to carry.  The string you wear around your neck can get hurt b/c it is so thin, should make it more bigger and comfortable to wear around neck.  Bushnell works fine and it just take a little time to get use to when you first use it.  But overall, I am fine with it.",positive
"The Item arrived on time. This binocular works well for swamp birds observation. The 10X is good enough for what I need it for, fast focus. Great value.",positive
"Works perfect, don't have a single negative thing to say about it. Don't worry if you wear glasses, the binoculars can be adjusted to your level vision, whatever it may be.",positive
"The optics are pretty clear, for a low dollar, high power compact. They are really small, but adjust easily so anyone can use them. They focus easily. The binocular construction seems strong, but the case is sloppy and weak. Though I've only strapped them on a dozen times, the case already has a wear hold near the belt loop. I'd definitely recommend them, even though I'll probably end up having to buy another case to hold them.",positive
Good binocular. Even a good item to gift also.Biggest advantage is that you can watch without glasses.,positive
"The focusing of these binoculars are horrible. It is terrible compared to the Olympus I bought from Amazon. The Olympus is double the price but it is far more superior. Trust me, don't get the Bushnell and go for the Olympus. I wish I hadn't purchase it...",negative
This binoculars are Faaaar from great but for the $35 they are probably the best thing out there. When you have used a par for binoculars that are a few hundred dollars to is hard to give a good review. This are pretty difficult to use with glasses but they again get the job done. I have these in my B.O.B. just in case.,positive
"Our son wanted a pair of binoculars for Christmas that &#34;actually worked&#34; (his words).  These are small, adjust from narrow to wide for all head sizes and have impressive magnification for a small product.  Worth the money.",positive
"I purchased this device for general use on vacation with no specific intentions. I actually found myself using my digital camera's zoom functions for distant viewing than using these binoculars. Buy a better set of binoculars if you actually intend to use them for more than bird watching, which might be painful at 21mm anyway...",negative
"My hubby and I are amateur birders - we have a very expensive set of field glasses but they are so heavy I cannot use them for extended periods.So, I bought myself this nice Bushnell binocular - and I LOVE it!  Very good for viewing, crisp images, and lightweight enough to use all day long without tiring my arms out!I recommend them as a good yet inexpensive binocular.",positive
"Purchased to view birds and wildlife from my kitchen window. Sharp, clear image at reasonable cost. Replaced old pair of 7x35's that no longer fuse images properly (dropped too many times) and a pair of compacts (too small for good image).",positive
I have bought a few binoculars in the past couple of years. And have been satisfied with only a couple.  These binoculars I am very pleased with. The clarity is very good and the price is terrific.  I have wasted alot of money on some not so good Bushnell binoculars. But this pair was a pleasant surprise.,positive
"Binocs delivered on time. Very nice quality. The rubber grip is great and the view is pretty good. I almost said &#34;exceptional&#34; but I don't have a better pair to compare them to. For the price, I'd say they're worth it.",positive
"This item is great for the price, in fact I was pretty impressed by the lens and the zoom.Pros: great zoom, amazing clarity, and very receptive control. Had terrific experience at the Everglades national park with this.Cons: no strap, the covers are really flimsy.",positive
good qualityeasy to managecould be a bit lighternot a must have but a good tool!,neutral
"They are good for the price. We use them for watching games, wildlife, and sometimes stars. I wish the case were a little sturdier, however.",positive
"Pros: Comfortable and powerful.Cons: HeavyThese are great binoculars, but I must admit that I don't enjoy carrying them on extended hikes. It's worth it, though when you spot something.",positive
I'm not a pro but this one meets all my needs. a bit heavy to carry around but the wide angle makes it worth,positive
"This is a great buy, much better than my Chinese binoculars. The optics are way better than expected. The only con so far is the weight, it is heavier than my old one so I have to try to rest it to focus properly.",positive
"Very impressive performance for the price! They do better than expected in lowlight conditions, the lenses don't fog (yet!) and the carrying case is anadded extra. I might buy another pair for my sons.",positive
"I couldn't get this product to focus, but this transaction is a testament to the amazing Amazon return policy.  They put the customer first.  They paid for the return of the product and reimbursed my payment 100%.  Thanks!",neutral
"These binoculars are the worst optics I've ever seen.  Dull images were out of focus and I could never get the pair to ""focus"" correctly. I had such high hopes as I remember Bushnell being superior quality.  Not any more. The optics are so bad, I was literally seeing double images.  Do yourself a favor and avoid spending any money on this product.",negative
Nice and useful item.  Great for a gift for the bird watcher or outdoorsman or woman.  Makes a very nice gift.,positive
"I really didn't realize just how faulty my 40 year old binoculars were until I purchased these.  What a huge difference.  I did a little research on what the binocular numbers mean.  These have just what I want.If you need a good pair at a great price,  this is a good one!",positive
for the price these work good... the strap is terrible. but the optics are decent. and price is great.,positive
"We use these for bird watching on our property. We love them. They are inexpensive, but not cheap at all. No, we are not expert binocular users but these do the job for what we need.",positive
I amy be spoiled by high quality military grade binos but am dissapointed in the dusk and dawn capability of these binos. Granted that is the hardest test but I have no issue hand holding this 50 power glasses. If truly trying to see small movement I do have to resort to propping or leaning support but find the field of view to be quite good for this priced binos.,positive
The great magnification makes this a fine choice. The price seals the deal. Reviews warned about shaky images--no problem if you have something to lean against.,positive
"I thought by taking the cap off and putting them up to the eyes, it would be easy to use.  Neither myself or my wife could see out of them.  It took quite a bit of adjusting to make the distance clear.  Maybe there are better models.  This is definitely not the case.",neutral
"These binoculars are pretty decent. Of course, you can not zoom in and see a hair on an elephants bottom but they work well for close to mid range bird watching and seeing what is going on in your neighborhood. Lol",positive
Bushnell PowerView Super High-Powered Surveillance Binoculars low priced but work surprising well my lenses are very clear. Not equal to high priced binoculars of course  but they are something to have and are useful.,positive
Great field of view.  Very clear even at long distance.  These are great for spotting deer in the woods or watching a suspect from a distance away.  Either way they are great.,positive
We live in a roof top apartment and have a nice view of the city.  Got these principally to be able to zoom in and see different details in the neighborhood and the city.We are binocular newbies - did not have any difficulties figuring out how to use them and are pleased with the purchase - we've had a lot of fun with these binoculars.,positive
"Shipped quickly and on time. Product is well built and performs as advertised. So easy to use,my Grandson loved them at the shore looking at the dolphins. Did I mention he's 5? Comes with nice case and strap. Very happy and would recommend.",positive
"Saw double images no matter where they were focused.  It was like looking through two scopes, the images never came together.  Maybe you need to have wide angle eyes to use these.",negative
"These are great binoculars, perfect for birders. Check out the full moon view as well. When viewed with these binoculars, moon completely occupies the field of view. That makes moon view most beautiful.",positive
"I had a bad experience with my Bushnell purchase, and the customer service at Bushnell is terrible, you just receive form emails back all the time.",negative
"I have both, Bushnell 10x50 and 20x50 and am totally pleased with both pair.  For the price, the images are sharp.  I was totally shocked to see the beauty of Pleiades with my 10x50s, which then, prompted me to get the 20s.  Either way, these binoculars are great for those like myself who are just beginning to skygaze.",positive
"This is my first pair of bio's I ever owned,when it came to me a eye peice was removed and I had to screw it back in but after that it seems to be working fine.I noticed a bit of the double vision/crossed eyed effect other reviewers talked about but it only seems to happen when I'm viewing certain distances and cant really seem to nail the focus.But honestly its not that much of a pain",positive
"Have tried different scopes and binoculars and this is the best for my backyard and woods. Easy to use, I support my elbows on the desk, and am able to use without a tripod. Perfect birdwatcher!",positive
Three problems.1. Focus mechanism to flimsy bends when you put binoculars to your head.2. The adjustable eyepiece ran out of adjustment for my eyes.3. The interpupillary adjustment did not open enough for my eyes to get a single circleI have a pair of Bushnell 10 x 50 binoculars and they're great but this item is a dud returned for credit. Disappointed in Bushnell with these.,negative
. I can focus on a bird at our feeder and then watch it flying all the way to its nest. I just touch the instant focus feature with my finger and do not have to take my eyes off it.,positive
"I'm a Nikon guy. But I bought a pair of these, for the price. I saved over $200.00 for this pair. You will get your moneys worth, without paying for the name. They focus well, not cheap. The neck strap could be stronger though. I'm glad I got these.  SW",positive
Glasses are very powerful I can read a license plate across the lake at 200 yards. The field of view is very narrow. I use them to look out over a large lake. For general scanning over the lake I use a pair of 10X50. I use the 20X50 for a closer look especially if the boat or object is over a 1000 yards out.,positive
"I purchased this for my daughter who loves watching the different species of birds visiting her feeder. This was replacing a smaller pair of binoculars. Only issue is if you are rather close to the object, say 25-30', there is no way to bring it into focus.Good price and quality combination.",positive
I was expecting a better visual field for the binoculars.  They are good but not great.,neutral
This binoculars are the best I've ever had. I can see very far away objects up close. The insta focus system works great. It comes with it's case and carry on straps. I've used them in stadiums in soccer games when I'm seated far away from the field and to watch whales at sea.,positive
No single view. Lenses are not aligned properly so you see two round views as opposed to one pic that you should see in a quality binoc.,negative
The lens cover is poorly made. The soft store bag has no protection for any force. It not looks like Bushnell product any more.,neutral
I bought this used. It worked - but I don't recommend this for mac. The phone company was more than patient and I got it to work only with their help. But a power interruption had me re-installing it from square one. My internet problems went away when I upgraded to an entirely different system. I haven't looked back since.,neutral
This is a great product - 10 minutes to set up and it works perfectly. A real winner.,positive
"We owned one of these routers for 4 years, and it was perfect. The item was easy to set up and never failed. We stopped using it only when we acquired a new IP provider that sent us a router and modem, all-in-one. Which, by the way, is not as good.Linksys really makes a great product.",positive
"I absolutely love this product.  It made setting up my own home network a snap.  Now all my computers can share the same T1 line, as well as each other's files.  Additionally, it provides the security of a hardware firewall!  I can specify which ports are open to which computers, rendering the computers MUCH more protected from the outside internet.  Plus, the router is small and easily sits on top of my subwoofer.  You can't go wrong buying this.",positive
Had to wait until I finally got my DSL working then connected 3 computers to the unit. All my computers are in the same room so wireless seemed like a lot of wasted money and time setting up. Everything works very well. I have recommended to my younger brother to get one. Great product.,positive
"After using this awhile, it seemed to give me a lot of problems. I finally gave in and bought another brand, {Belkin} and I have had no headaches since then. Wouldn't buy another Linksys again!",negative
"The LinkSys 4-Port Cable/DSL Router was very easy to set up and in the five months I have had it, it has worked flawlessly. I have two computers running off it with different operating systems and I can detect no degredation of speed.What can I say? It's great to buy something that does what it's supposed to, is fairly priced, and is also reliable.",positive
I was in need of connecting a desktop and two laptops in my home and using this router I could get the desired. It has been three months since I am using this and found very satisfactory with the product.I would recommend this as a good option for connecting more than one computer.,positive
"I've had this Linksys router for over 2 years, and it has been quite solid and reliable.Setup is a breeze - configure through a web browser.  Just enter your PPPoE account info and go.  Built-in DHCP server makes home networking easy.VPN works, though you may need to open some ports for gaming, such as Warcraft III.  The only minus is file transfer doesn't work with ICQ, but I think that applies to all routers/firewalls.",positive
I was up and running with my Cable Modem and 2 computers in 20 minutes.  Shields Up says that I am STEALTH MODE on all ports and my system is virtually invisible to the internet.,positive
"This unit works well. It took me quite a while to set it up on a Macintosh, and included a lot of guessing, since the instructions are not at all Mac friendly. Once up and running, however, it works like a charm. Mac instructions would have been helpful. In a nation that's obsessed with diversity, there seems scant attention paid to diversity in computing.",positive
"With only a quick reference to the quickstart guide I took it out of the box, hooked in my PC with WinXP, PC with RedHat Linux, a Laptop running WinXP and a DSL Modem, and everything connected up first time, and stayed that way.I did download and run the lastest firmware upgrade from the LinkSys website just to be sure all known problems were fixed....and after 3 months, still no problems.",positive
"This is an excellent product.  I had no problem with the set up and it is a must have for anyone with a DSL or Cable modem connection.  The 4 port 10/100 switch, Firewall, and internet connection sharing capabilities are perfect for the home user who would like to set up a small network or just have internet sharing among PC's.  This works much better than a software sharing solution and is secure.",positive
"As others have reported, quality is disappointing. Thought it was a good router at a decent price, until it started breaking down, regularly (shows red diagnostic light).Linksys website indicates that company knows about the problem, and will replace (only) if within warranty period.  Technically within their rights, but seems unethical to me -- they sold a defective product and aren't taking the responsibility for it.Recommend you avoid this, and be careful about other Linksys products.",negative
"I've tried them all. This router is the only router that handles all internet/network functions. Simple to configure, protection at its best. (...) And as an extra PLUS go out and purchase and plugin the wireless Linksys WAP11. (I Did) Now you will have wired desktops and wireless laptops and you will be in heaven....",positive
"No problems out of the box. Will do what you purchased it to do. But we are talking about a [...] router and the technology has advanced since then.  Nice, inexpensive alternative but if you are looking for better performance and more features, time to move on.Purchased this exact router on October 31, 2002 from Amazon. It is still in my order history and used the link from that order to write my review.",positive
highly recommend.  easy to use and configure.i've had great luck with linksys networking products.haven't reset it once in 2 years.,positive
"Bought this specifically to put the DDWRT software on it.  Upped the transmission power to 100dbm and now have quite the range of connectivity throughout the house and even in to the neighbor's house when ever we sit on their back deck.  I have 4 bars, he's only got 2 on his own network lol!",positive
Recently I upgraded my cable internet service from 5 Mbps to 15 Mbps. My cable company recommended that to benefit from the higher speed service I should replace my 4 or 5 year old modem and router with modern ones. I now have a Motorola Surfboard 5120 cable modem and this Linksys router and am pleased with both of them.,positive
"Probably a good product, I'd read good things, but it sure didn't work to hook up our 2 Mac computers. Went through a headache with tech support but in the end it just didn't support Mac. Returned it and got a D-Link instead which worked great from the get go and hasn't given us any problems since.",neutral
It is really simple to install this router. The installation guide is just one large colorful chart but complete. It took about 15 minutes total to install and connect it to my three home computes. I also have had a Linksys switch for about three years and expect this router to be as reliable.,positive
"I bought this router from Amazon on February 16, 2003.  It has been running continuous since it arrived.  I have never had any problem with it, even with peer-to-peer clients running nearly continuous on two computers.  It is also very fast.  I just bought a wireless access point last month and plugged it into this router and am now slamming another two computers through it (five total) and it's all drama-free with this unit.",positive
"Just connect the router (CABLE MODEM /DSL), the computers and you're ready to surf !!!!!!!!!!!! ITs really easy to set up......It just take 5 or 6 minutes to make any changes in the configuration in case that your ISP requires them...It can work also as DHCP, that's a great point if youu're not an advanced user.Beleiveme, its a good deal !",positive
"I have never set up a router before, and had this up and going in less than a minute, following one page of simple connection instructions  in doc folder on the included cd.  The cd setup wizard program will not work with apple computer, but it is very simple setup. I did not have to enter any information, just power off everything, and follow connection instructions carefully. This was on I Mac, version 10.4.7, using insight broadband.",positive
"version 2 (BEFSR41 v2) has been out for at least 9 months.  If the information is wrong and this is really version 2, then its a good deal. otherwise find a version 2 elsewhere",neutral
"doesnt inform you that you need to go auto config in wondows ... if you go static IP, you are screwed!",negative
Best Bang for the Buck Router.I bought one in 2001 and was hooked - I bought another one for another LAN I'm setting up and its even better w/ a brand new menu interface and still possesses the same great Linksys quality at the usual low price.STRONG BUY,positive
"I've had the Linksys 4-port router for 6 months now and haven't had a hitch with it yet.  Easy to setup, even for novices - and when you need details or help the tech support is friendly and extremely helpful (but you may have to wait a bit).Edit:  I wrote the above review in 2001, and the router is still going strong ... a very solid product indeed.",positive
"Weekly disconnects which tech support wasn't able to solve.  Finally, it wouldn't connect at all.  After spending the better part of a day with the LIVE CHAT SUPPORT (VERY helpful, btw) it was concluded that the unit was defective and needs to be replaced.  As this is my 2nd unit I won't be buying Linksys again.",negative
"Plugged it in, set it up, it's worked fine ever since. No trouble, no hassle, haven't bothered with the firmware upgrades. The address translation is seamless and neither the network-based or traditional *nix portscanning tools have uncovered any holes or vulnerabilities. The web-based setup tool works very nicely.",positive
"Replacement for one that failed due to power surge caused by thunderstorm.Old unit still worked, but lost one of its ports.",positive
"I'm tired of this quality! I don't even remember owning this, it lasted so short.It's a crap shoot how long they'll last. 2 years? 1 year? 6 mos?",negative
"(...) I have never set up a network in all my life. Today I did: Three completely different Computers: Desktop AMD 1.4GHz - Windows XP, Desktop Pentium II 200 MHZ - Windows 98, Laptop Pentium III 650 MHz - Windows 98, Cable modem....Piece of cake. The Linksys does everything practically on its own.This thing works like a charm. Documentation is great, Speed is great....my home network rocks! Highly recommend this router!!!!!",positive
"OK, so I'm not a computer moron, but up until now, I had not been willing to tackle home networking.  The Linsys hardware is completely stable and reliable, and sharing our DSL connection through the router is a breeze.",positive
This is my third router with the same model number.  This brand/model has been excellent for the last six years.  Reliable and reasonably priced.,positive
"The Linksys Cable/DSL router and ethernet switch works. You plug it in, connect your computer(s) and modem to it and then add your internet username and password to the router using a simple web browser interface. That's as hard as it gets installing this device. The built-in ethernet switch saves you space and money by eliminating yet another piece of equipment to attach several computers to your router/network.",positive
"If the protection and versatility that this unit offers isn't enough, the EXTREMELY easy set up should be.  I just followed the instructions included in the box and I was up and running.  I have 3 machines running off my Cable internet connection.  I couldn't be happier with this Linksys router.",positive
"WORKS GREAT, EASY TO INSTALL!  If you're looking for a quality router that is easy to configure, this is the way to go and the connectivity speeds are much better than wireless.",positive
"i get disconnected at least 3 or 4 times a day using these linksys wireless routers. Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink.At best, each time i get disconnected i have to restart my pc and the router and wait 10 minutes to get back online again. if you're doing something important, forget it!",negative
"At the same time I bought the Linksys Cable Modem, I bought this router/switch to allow all the machines on my in-house network to access the Internet.  It replaced my previous hub without a glitch, and smoothly connected to the cable modem.  Everything works perfectly!  An added feature I wasn't aware of, but which turned out to be helpful, was the ability to filter a particular MAC address to prevent access to the Internet.  Quite handy, that.",positive
This is my first experience with a router of any sort.  It worked great right out of the box.  Easy to set up and understand.,positive
I have had this router so long I cannot remember if a review was written. About the time of 911 this router was purchased.  Wireless then was out of the question.This thing keeps going and going. The only problem was a dead port. I have since daisy chained the router to a Linksys WRT54G2 wireless and it is still running flawlessly.,positive
"We've had this router for some time now, and it works great! We use this in our office and we have had no problem with it. Our frequent Quake sessions have also improved. Great solution for any home or office network.",positive
"Easy to set up and connect and it's been working fine.  Don't even think about it.  No need to, it just does its thing.",positive
"For months my cable connection was going down several times a day with monotonous regularity and I was on the phone with my cable company more than I was online.  As a last resort, I decided to replace my (non Linksys) router with this one and I couldn't be more pleased.  From the moment that I installed it--which was a snap--it has functioned flawlessly and seamlessly.  I just wonder why I waited so long.",positive
Bought this as a known good solution to setup a home office network (DSL connection).,positive
Wanted to replace original router but found that the software version of this router did not have the QOS option that I wanted.,neutral
Haven't had any problems with mine.  The perfect solution for a small office or a home with multiple computers.  Can be configured via any computer (through any web browser)--just set it and forget it!,positive
works well and easy set up.  Just a little confusing when it comes to the isp pasword and username...  i cant find it and my nat type is not open any more so im having to have someone come over to fix it for me.  other than that things work well.,positive
"I purchased this product a few months ago to share an ADSL connection between computers.  Had it up and running in a few minutes and it's worked flawlessly since.  I'm going to purchase another for my small business.  Good documentation, too -- a rarity with home networking products.",positive
"I have had this router for just over a year and it has started dropping connections. Chatted with customer service who seem to have no clue. But that aside, when you are chatting they walk away never to return again. I wonder if their connections dropped too. I would not consider purchasing Linksys products again.",neutral
"well, ive had this for about 2 years now but am only writing the review now. anyways, this router works great, i have dsl. the interface is easy to work with and you wont get confussed at all.",positive
My buddies and I bought this unit way back when at twice the price.  After some setup screwups we all got our linkys working perfectly with our cable modems.  Since then our linkys have been real work horses.  I love the linky hardware firewall protection.  The only time I need to drop protection and go into the linky dmz zone is for MS Netmeeting.  You will not go wrong buying this product.,positive
"This was exactly what I was looking for when I got my cable connection.  Easy to set up, took 15 minutes!  If a friend comes over with his computer,  easy to plug them in on the network to share the connection or just swap  some files.  And the firewall is great for protecting my computer from the  rest of the net!  I love this cable router and HIGHLY recommend it.",positive
I've always had good luck with linksys routers. So I picked up this one to replace my 12yr old linksys that went out on me. So far this one works with no issues.,positive
This has now  been running for 8 years and it rarely gets turned off.  Wish other things lasted this long.,positive
"and can report having had absolutely zero problems in sharing (2) DSL and (1) Cable connections and in running small networks. As I evolve slowly to a new operating system (Windows XP), it was nice to learn that the router allows machines running different OSs to communicate flawlessly.",positive
"Administrate through a browser, set up a firewall, create a DMZ, direct  incoming connections, supports VPNs - what more could you ask for? I  heartily recommend this product.",positive
Out of the box and running in 10 minutes. I had to re-route the cables so it really only took 5 minutes to get it up and running. Best to know you Network's requirements before you physically hook everything up.,positive
I bought this unit so my wife and I could share our cable modem. We have not had any problems with the unit. An added bonus is that it gets the IP address thereby creating a firewall for incoming hackers (you may still want a firewall to make sure no programs/trojan horses on your PC send info to the internet without you knowing about it).,positive
"I have a home network connected by cables right now, but I am working with Arduino, and I hope to be able to set up WiFi connections with the units soon.",positive
"Product Rating: 5Support Rating: 1 (just because there isn't a lower one)Buying a linksys product is like purchasing something from Fry's Electronics... Find what you want, and pray it doesn't fail. If it does, just burn it and buy something else because dealing with support is not worth the headache.The hardware is wonderful by the way.",neutral
Can not go wrong with a Linksys. Easy installation with a lot of setup options.Runs cool and this are stackable. Comes with lan cable and instruction cd.These are a must for any broadband user. This router will creat a network and protect you. Other users or hackers will only see the router not you!,positive
Easy to use and does what is says it does. Web interface is handy too.,positive
"This was a simple setup and saved me a lot of trouble getting my DSL working on both my computers.  It's been problem free and there's not much more to say about it.  If you've got more than one computer and have high speed internet access, unless you want wireless networking, this will probably do fine for you.",positive
"I'm not currently using this device, but only because I've &quot;upgraded&quot; to the BEFSR81, when the BEFSR41 power adapter pooped out (I'll get it replaced, but I couldn't stand to be down even one day). Great product. As others have mentioned, this device has &quot;hung&quot; occasionally, but I'm not sure whether that's the device or ISP's fault. Simple to configure (easier than the BeadleNet SOHO alternative). 255 NAT'ed DHCP clients. Works great. Good work, Linksys!",positive
"Finally disconnected this piece of doodoo.  Got very tired of resetting, unplugging, etc.  Man, never thought a wired connection would be such a pain in the (&*%^*.",negative
THINKING about networking the computers was harder than doing it! Linksys made it all  SOOOO easy. I might begin by telling you that I know NOTHING about computers or networking! This is as close to plug and play as you get. Windows XP did the set up for me. In ten minutes I had 3 computers (2 desktops and a laptop) all hooked up and running at once. I am VERY impressed!!,positive
"works fine on my rig. I have a wireless G router, and Xbox 360, a roku box, and a PC attached.",positive
"We have used a router, Linksys, for more than 10 years. We have two computers in the same room and need the router so my wife can be on line for her business, The new router is performing perfectly and I would recommend it to anyone in need of such an instrument.",positive
THis router works great for the two computers that we need wired for our house. For some reason ive had trouble connecting more than 2 uses to the router though...but the third and fourth arent needed. Good router. Good price.,positive
"THIS ROUTER WAS EASY AS PIE TO INSTALL.DRIVER CD,INSTRUCTIONS,THE WHOLE NINE YARDS ALL WELL WITHIN THE LOW PRICE AND A SUPER GREAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT TO ANY HOME OR OFFICE NETWORK.GREAT QUALITY.RECOMMEND 100%!",positive
I bought this router based on a very strong recommendation from a friend & I'm happy with that decision. Easy to setup. The internal LAN runs at 100Mbps. The built-in firewall is great for Cable-Modem & DSL users whose PCs are exposed to the Net without this firewall. It also looks nice. Won't go wrong getting this one.,positive
"I returned this item because I could not get it to work with my computer.  However to be a refurbished item, it looked practically new.  No problem returning it.",negative
I found this product very easy to setup and easily installed.  For the money I couldn't find anything that came as close.  My only complaint is the lack of manual support for advanced features and the fact that it did  not come with a CAT5 cable.,positive
I installed this router to network a couple of computers in my home. Installation was a snap and it works GREAT. I highly reccomend this router to anyone of any computer experience level.,positive
While I am retiring my Phonelink network as I now use Wi-fi everywhere I would like to say that I have been very happy with those cards:They only provide about 10 Mbps but that is good enough to access the Internet.They do not suffer from interference.An interesting fact is that they somehow work on Windows 7 32-bit using the old Windows 2000 driver.,positive
"4 computers networked over distances of up to 150 feet. Used existing phone lines. Easy setup, very fast, does not interfere with other phone uses. Drawback is no simple way (that I have found) to share a broadband  connection. Linksys tech assistance quite limited. Internet sharing  software included with system outdated and not upgradable and not supported  by software publisher.",positive
"Small office, 3 machines linked on one phone line (which is also fax line), 2 Win98s, 1 Win95.  Hardest to set up with Win95.  For some reason driver did not seem to want to load.  I had to completely uninstall network components and reinstall, then install driver manually.  Worked after that.  Think it was a comflict with a Bios setting but never confirmed it.",positive
"Worked beautiful, no problem and the price was right, I will recommend this product to my friends and family all the time",positive
"While designed for a purpose, this device isn't easy to use, and it seemed to be aimed towards a certain community. It will continue to be a part of my collection because that purpose will soon be made available.",neutral
"this is a usb 1.1 to ethernet adapter, and it works great with a series 2 tivo.  I use it with an old wireless router configured as a bridge to replace a wireless adapter that was not working reliably.Series 2 tivo has a usb 1.1 port and does not use usb 2.0, so there is no need to use a faster adapter.This device was simple to set up.",positive
I bought these because they were in the list of adapters supported by the old TIVOS and they worked great!,positive
"After the wireless adapter that we were using with an ancient TiVo gave up the ghost, we switched to a hard-wired connection.  This network adapter did the trick.  It was immediately recognized by the TiVo, grabbed an IP address via DHCP and we were back up and running.  It was a bit humorous to see a 3.5&#34; floppy disk with Windows 98 drivers included in the box, but we didn't need any of the drivers.",positive
"I rate this product excellent for what i needed it for. I was hooked up through tivo through dialup, and man that was a pain. This allowed my phone to be free and use broadband which i already had, so much faster, i dont even know when it updates anymore because it does not interfere with anything anymore, so if you own a tivo, this is a must have.",positive
What they don't tell you is that the item works with very limited OS systems and there hasn't been a firmware update forever to accommodate newer OS.  Sent this back right away.,negative
"I've been using this for 4 months, now and it has worked flawlessly.  Very convienent for switching between two PC's using the same monitor/keyboard/mouse.  Amazon's price is the best I've seen for this type and quality of product.",positive
"Extreamly easy to setup and operate. Best of all, it doesn't need (yet another) wall transformer to power it. The little power it needs, comes from your connected PCs. Switching between PCs is a simple matter of pressing a few keys in sequence, or pushing a button on the KVM box. This little item is a most welcome addition to my home office!  :)",positive
"It is in daily use for switching on my older, and less exotic computers.Currently using it to switch between three (Win-7, Linux, Win-XP) computers.It uses VGA and PS/2 connectors, but have had no problem with the MAJORITY (though not with all) USB&lt;>PS/2 and VGA&lt;>DVI adapters.The main problem is with the maximum supported monitor resolution being 1920 x 1440.Even though it is of cheap-feeling plastic construction, it has lasted all this time.I don't give out a lot of FIVES.",positive
"Easy to use and simple to connect.  I use it with 4 PC's and it switches without a hitch.  You'll need to pick up the cable kits - be sure and order them with the unit.  Regular cables obviously wont work.  I velcro'd mine under my desk, then used wire holds to secure the wires.  Great buy. I also purchased the 2 unit model for use at home.",positive
"I have 2 of the Elph models and I must say I think they're the best APS cameras available. They are incredibly compact, very sturdily built and take wonderful pictures. The Elph 2 has a smooth 2:1 zoom and a much-improved flash unit (over the original Elph 1). While I prefer my Elph LT270, whichever Elph you choose will make you happy for years to come.",positive
First of all... the price and quality are superb.I have owned mine for about nine months now enduring vacations in Austria and Mexico City. I have had absolutely no problems with my photos (regardless of the countless times I've erased single/all photos as well as formatted the card).You will be pleased with this card.,positive
This is a good quality product. Buy it. Don't buy the invitations and risk lost photos.The price maybe a few dollars more but aren't your pictures worth keeping?,positive
"The first card I bought was DOA. The second (for a Diamond Rio) works fine  everytime. Of note, the formatting for a Diamond Rio is different from that  for anything else, so even SanDisk's USB (etc) readers cannot decipher data  on a card that has been in a Rio. For that you must use the RioPort  software or erase and reformat the card in the device in which you would  like to use it.",positive
What else can I say other than this item worked in the camera that I bought it for. I look forward to the day when these cards are cheaper. But the ScanDisk product was competively priced with other brands.,positive
"I use these headphones exclusively on my home computer with the Sound Blaster Audigy sound card, and with my iPod. These are the richest and cleanest sounding headphones that I've ever owned. The dymamic range is excellent, good clean bass and good clean highs. Definitely worth the price of admission.",positive
So she uses the film. She loves it. Of course it's easier forher than trying to figure out some new-fangled too-many-bells-and-whistlesdigital camera. So we keep ordering her film from Amazon since we can't get what shewants for a decent price locally.,positive
Skip this one and get either: Kodak Royal Gold 400 or Fuji Superia 400.  If you settle for this film you are going to possibly compromise your photo shot.,negative
I hope they don't stop making these.  There is a romantic appeal to celluloid which brings back memories of past days....,positive
"It's getting hard to find film in stores, and this film gives great definition and color.",positive
"Would love to have a screen protector that works.  This cover is very thick and it is very difficult to make the stylus function.  After getting used to it, you can make do.  The dark coloring makes it impossible to view on the indoor setting when under bright lighting.  Outdoors it is much worse and very difficult to read even on the outdoor setting.  Definitely avoid this one.  I want my money back!",negative
"I had bought this for my Jornada 548 - yes, I still have the PDA and it works fine although it is very long in the tooth now :-) Maybe someday I will be able to sell it to a museum :-) The screen protector has done a wonderful job over the years and has ensured that the endless Solitare and other games have not scratched the LCD screen. A very fine product indeed!",positive
"Yes. Not a bad accessory, especially considering its price. But it gets scratched and marked very easy. A kind of sacrifice-surface that helps protect your Jornada screen glass. Six sheets will last three or four months, I think.Besides, I totally agree with several users on the point that HP could have documented better this accessory.",neutral
Now i dont have to worry about scratches. A packet should last a year or two.,positive
"A most for my Jornada. My screen will last very, very long now. Character recognition is just fine. This thing works... as long as you remove BOTH plastic covers. I highly recomend it.",positive
"I've been through three of these little suckers in six weeks! All broke in exactly the same way: the on/off switch drops out, and eventually the unit won't power up. Despite the fact that Amazon and Rio have been great about shipping replacements, this is an essentially flawed product (as corroborated by Rio's customer support - who today offered to ship me unit #4).Look elsewhere!",negative
"Heavy duty, but the white appearance keeps it from looking industrial.  I keep one upstairs and one downstairs.  The extra 20 feet give me an enough length to vacuum the entire floor (with an Oreck) without having to re-plug in.",positive
"These cords are great, work well, and are a good value with Prime free shipping.  They are available in many different lengths (6, 12, 20, 40, 80 foot, etc.) and are reasonably priced.  The longer lengths usually are not that much more than the preceding shorter length in price, so think carefully before purchasing.",positive
"Good price on a small gauge FLEXIBLE outdoor cord.  I use it for my Bug Zapper, it lays nice and flat and disappears into the grass, so it can be walked over and not a trip hazard.  Even has survived a few dog bits from my 2 puppies.  And it didn't pierce all the way through, so it's still good.",positive
ordered this when I needed a couple more strings out there... didnt know where they would go but it was mid-December and the front yard needed a little more umpf.  This was the link to the umpf.,positive
"Not really much you can say other than this works as intended.  I just needed to plug in something on the other side of the room from the plug and this worked great, it is very flexible so its easy to bend around and behind things.",positive
"Do you need a review? It's like any other extension cable, about 20 feet long, white and extends power.More serious side, it's decently constructed.",positive
"This cord seems as if it will suffice. It is long enough to reach from the outlet on the outside corner of the house to the backyard shed that I am converting into a workshop (hence the need for electrical power) yet can be easily coiled onto a fence post mounted storage apparatus when not needed.I'll see how it holds up to the Oregon weather, and update this review, after some time has passed.",positive
This cord spent the winter exposed the weather and still is like new.No problems with cracking or the cord ends.,positive
"Works just fine and plenty long for my needs.  What are you waiting for?  If you need it, get it, you probably won't beat the price.",positive
"I have found this to be a reliable cord,  I use it for hand tools etc. and lighting and have no problems with it, the 16/3 wire is good enough for the uses I have for it.",positive
"yes it is true, this cable allows me to plug stuff in from across the room.  I wanted white because I plug in my macbook power adapter.  I can use one of the outlets on the other side of the room while sitting on the couch- I am the coolest kid in the library. This will work for indoor or outdoor. coooooool.",positive
"This chord works great outdoors, rain or shine.  I leave it out 24/7 and it is attached to my bug zapper light.",positive
The price sure was right and it looks heavy duty we will see how it holds up!!,positive
I don't know what else to say about an extension cord.  They worked fine.  I used them for LED christmas lights in my outside trees.  The cords blended into the grass a lot better than any standard orange/beige cords would have.,positive
"Great product!  Solid construction.  Held up through the winters, the snow, the storms, etc. etc.  Still looks new, albeit with dirt on it.  Works like a charm.  Trusted product.  Would buy again!",positive
"This cable is great for towing trailers, hanging tire swings and has a bonus use of being able to plug one side into a power outlet and the other side into an electronic device, like an alarm clock.",positive
"I am glad I got it as needed the 80 feet and the price was great also, has the three prong end which is a plus also to me,  Thank you",positive
VERY GOOD QUALITY AND GOOD FOR THE OUTDOORS. We have our Christmas lights attached to the extention and was covered with snow. No Problems.,positive
"Well, it seems sturdy enough.  It's flexible and because it's green it doesn't call attention to itself as an orange cord would.  So far, I'm happy.",positive
White color blends in with molding and I finally have power at my fan on the other side of the patio enclosure.,positive
This is truly a great product and the best price online.  I am truly pleased with this product and will of course buy again!,positive
This is a great cable for the fountain at my house as it is white and so is the house so you don't see it across the garage.  Works perfect.,positive
"But I think it's a bit too short for using it with the leaf blower. But that's my fault.Still I couldn't be bothered to return it. Having said that, Amazon PAIRED it with the leaf blower, saying &#34;other customers bought this. So it's Amazon's fault. :) Or everyone else that bought this cord with that leaf blower.",positive
The price couldn't be beat. It does what it supposed to do. No complaints from me. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a extension cord.,positive
"I purchased this cord to run from the front porch all the way across the front yard to outdoor Christmas decorations, and it has worked perfectly. The connection at the decorations (female end of power cord) even got wet from sprinklers, and I had zero issues.",positive
"This item is a high quality, outdoor extension cord that works fine in the rain and snow in case you need to connect any holiday lights.",positive
So it pretty much met my expectations.  This is a pretty standard extension cord with a 1:1 ratio or power in to power out!  I use it outside as it is described.  I have not tried it inside...,positive
Purchased these to use on wreaths I hang at my office during the holidays.  They hang from the second floor on the main thoroughfare in the town I live.  I wanted the white ones basically for aesthetic reasons; the bright orange and yellow ones just spoil the Look (and the Mood).They work fine and looked great.,positive
This is a very heavy duty outdoor cord. I have used it several times and it seems like it will last for a very long time!!!,positive
"The extension cord is just as described, all good, and now I have to write some more words for the review, so I did",positive
"I have a couple of this use them in the office and meeting rooms, although this is supposed to be an outdoor extension cord.It is sturdy and well made. The only thing is that the white color does get dirty after a while but hey it's an utility cord.",positive
"Here's all you need to know, it withstood a December rainstorm and kept my Christmas lights lit for 3 days (inadvertently left on by yours truly). Price is right, and there is truly a thick coating of rubber on the 20 foot wire. Works great!",positive
"I had purchased a gas power generator, so I was looking for cords to run thru the house in case of emergency.  Trying to avoid the ""Big Box"" experience, I found these cords were actually less expensive and had free shipping.",positive
I purchased this extension cord for use outdoors during the Christmas holidays. I used this one for an led spot light that I put in the flower bed on the side of my house. Through snow and rain this extension cord just kept on working. Great delivery and a very fair price and Prime shipping.,positive
"Have this running from an outlet to a Cooper Flood lamp in a dark side yard -Cooper Lighting SP100 Aluminum 75-Watt Halogen Landscape Light, Greenand will know tonight how well the light works for the intended purposes.",positive
"I was looking for a quality cord to run some Christmas lights on my roof. My other cord was orage and looked terrible. This is a good, heavy duty outdoor cord and you couldn't see it from the street.",positive
I used this to run to my TV that I had mounted on the wall at my apartment as it was white and blended in to the white walls easily. Its high quality and works as expected.,positive
Very durable and heavy duty cable. It is great for camping sites which is why I bought it. Hasn't frayed and I got this >1 year ago and it has been overly used at home.,positive
"Nothing special, serves the purpose and is reasonably priced. For some reason local stores do not carry them in stock",positive
"Was looking for a white outdoor extension cord for a while, until I found this one. Needed it to run down the side of my house and blend in with the ""whitish"" color. Cord is of GREAT quality. Exactly like the other orange black and green cords you'd normally find, only white.",positive
"Purchased this adapter to plug a 120 volt, 20 amp twist-lock pool filter plug into an outdoor 20 amp, 3-prong GFI outlet.  Works great, nice heavy duty construction. For under $10 you can't go wrong. Highly recommend!",positive
great product for hte price.  I came on time and worked well. Exactly the cord adapter that I needed. Others were 3x the price.,positive
"Coleman Cable 09021 12/3 9-Inch Generator Cord Adapter, L5-20P to 5-15R.A convenient addition for owners of portable generating with L5-20R output but not the extension cord.",positive
This does exactly what it is designed to do.  It locks tight on one end and plugs in to the wall on the other.,positive
"Bought this cable to connect my new pool pump to the old outlet. Worked like a charm! Quick delivery, good product, just the right size, and much cheaper than buying from Home Depot!",positive
Works great as an adapter for theater lights. It is just the right tool for the job. I love it.,positive
I've had it for almost 2 years and now it just isn't working right 90% of the time.  I'm ready to toss the S.O.B. but I am struggling to figure out a reasonable cost alternative for home-studio CD mastering and reproduction.Damn - thought it would last longer....,negative
"I recently purchased one of these recorders and found it to be quick easy, and no fuss.  It has great functionality and the external input is a good touch",positive
"I don`t know why so many people are having problems with this unit. I purchased mine in 2000 as a factory refurbished unit, and have burned 10`s of mix cd`s on Sony, Maxell, Fugi, and other brands with no problems whatsoever.  Use ONLY ""music"" or ""audio"" cd`s for recording. You`ll be surprised how many people try using standard CD-R, or CD-RW to save a few pennies, and then condemn the unit when it doesn`t work!",positive
I bought this cause I needed something fast and didn't want to spend a lot of money.  The unit ok ok.  It eats batteries fast and picture quality is mediocre at best.  I should have ponied up the cash for a better camera.,negative
"Bought two of these cameras to take photos for  insurance purposes.  There was no flash when I took the photos, so when I called the company they confirmed that was correct. When I took another shot, there was a flash.  Needless to say, nothing came out.  Can anyone recommend a digital?",negative
I would like to take some pictures of everything that I owned just for the last five years.  And to get a value on two art works.,positive
"I got mine at a closeout for less than $15. They are better than Logitech and the Labtec 45 by far. Loud enough for the kids in the back to hear without straining their ears; with quality, too. I sure hope they haven't stopped making them!",positive
"These speakers are a big improvement over the built-in speakers on my laptop. They are not to large, but provide excellent sound. The AC adapter block is considerably small, a surprise for multimedia speakers. Headphone jack is convenient too. Bass, mid-range, and highs are all good. Don't be fooled by the 2 watt rating - they sound like 10 watts or more! They are definitely worth it for any user who needs a simple two-speaker system.",positive
"I'm on my 4th digital camera, and this is it, and boy is it amazing.  You can print out 8x10 (using ofot.com or shutterfly) and not be able to tell it wasn't a film camera!  The microdrive gives you more capacity than  you'll ever need.  Great LCD screen and great USB transfers.",positive
"I love the Casio QV3000EX.  I use mine in conjunction with the IBM 1Gig Microdirve.  Without the need to load any additional software or drivers, I can swap the microdrive between the camera and PC with ease.  The 1 Gig holds 600+ high-resolution pictures and makes emailing and posting pictures of incredible resolution a snap...!",positive
"Crips highs, clear voices and instruments, not overpowered lows, thats how I resume the sound performance of the very amazing HD 600. The only drawback for me is the pale esthetic of the cans, otherwise I would have given all 5 stars.",positive
"These headphones are on the expensive side if you are new to hifi audio, but after using them for quite some time now, i can say that they are worth every $ a paid. The detail of sound and clarity you get is unmatched, Sennheiser is a great brand and as with everything if you take care of them they will be with you for quite some time. Really happy with this purchase",positive
"I always used Sony headphones since the sound quality is quite nice and it is priced reasonably. I ended up buying this headphone through lightning deal.  After listening to various type of music (anywhere from classical to trance), my overall rating for sound quality is 5 stars yet due to its low volume I give 4 for total.",positive
These have gotten better with age. The more you play them the better they get. My neighbor offered and I accepted $300.00 for my year and a half old HD600's. He went to BB and bought a pair of HD650s and mine sounded far better. I did tell him it takes time to break them in. The question is get another pair of these or are the HD650's better?,positive
"These are the best headphones you can buy. They are better than the HD 650. As a professional musician, I am always amazed as I travel around the world to recording studios and radio broadcasts that these headphones are everywhere. Beautiful, balanced sound & exceptional clarity.",positive
Great headphones.  Nicely balanced (sonically).,positive
"I personally like these better than the HD650's. Sound is a little lighter and more musical to my ears. These are very close to the Senn HD800's I own, at about 40% of the cost. If you want to spend less than $1k, I would go with these.",positive
I have had these phones several years now and they are excellent.  I much prefer these for accuracy when compared to the veiled and unnaturally creamy sound of the HD650s which I ended up returning.  The phones are also more comfortable to wear for long periods of time.,positive
"These are the reference headphones against which all others are inevitably compared. If you knew to look for these, though, you probably already knew that.",positive
"First headphones that I can wear with glasses that are super comfortable for long listening periods.  Fantastic sound, very long cable.",positive
"I'm a long time audiophile and simply put, these are the best headphones I've had the pleasure of experiencing... worth it.",positive
"...They come in a beautiful black presentation box.  It's almost too nice to through away!The headphones are comfortable, completely surround the ear, and have aweseome sound.  I'm ordering a mid range amplifier to give it more pep as my walkman doesn't have enough power to really drive these.  They are by far the best headphones I've ever owned.  You can't go wrong with the price - go for it.",positive
"I'm listening with my new HD600 + Apogee Duet headphone amp, and it's amazing. If you try using these nice cans to directly plug into your macbook pro or ipod, you're really wasting your money. I also have Etymotic ER-4P's and they sound nearly identical without microphone amp. With an amp, it really sets it apart, especially if you're going to pay almost $400.",positive
"I decided they were a bit too warm for my tastes. They are a classic however, and sound great for the money in particular.",positive
"Pro: An excellent all-around performer. Good deal under $300.Con: Cable sub classNotes:To unleash full potential of these high impedance studio cans, you need another 1000-2000 dollar investment on DAC and ampiliers (pre and/or power level). These cans are basically rubbish-in-rubbish-out, so forget about plugging them into your portable devices or entry level AV receivers, it will disappoint you.",positive
"I received my Wharfedale Anniversary 7 speakers today and am highly impressed.  I listen to mostly classical music - lots of solo piano and guitar - and the sound is spactacular compared to the Bose speakers I was using.  I do not use the ""loudness"" setting on my receiver anymore.  Sound is great at all volume levels.  Clarity of sound is remarkable and the bass is more than adequate.",positive
"Fine speakers for use as primary loudspeakers in a smaller room. Wharfedale instructions are true - if you place them about two feet from the wall (back surface) the bass is incredible. So, in a sense, while they'll fit on a &quot;bookshelf&quot;, they don't perform their best on a shelf. I adjusted placement and am very pleased.",positive
"A great product for traveling, compact, light and easy to focus. I take them everywhere I travel. I highly recommend.",positive
"These binocs are great.Pros: Easy focusing knob, bright, powerful zoom, and lightweight.Cons: Eyepieces can be a pain with big glasses.The carrying case and neck strap are nicely desigend as well. Get these binocs! :)",positive
"Good optics, perfect magnification for sporting events, and at an awesome price. To top it off, a 6 foot drop onto concrete caused no damage.",positive
"These binoculars have a nice bright clear image, even in low light conditions. They are easy to focus. I find it best to use them without my eyeglasses and compensate for my poor eyesight with the focus wheel. The binoculars are light and compact. You will not be disappointed with them, for sure! :-D",positive
These tapes are great if you still have a VCR. They work wonderful for me and will order more when I use these up!,positive
"If you need extended recording time on a VC, this is the way to go. You can get 3 hours at SP speed and 9 hours at EP speed. This VC works great and I have even been able to use it on a older VCR that has a tendency eat tapes is they don't track well. Good tape!",positive
"These tapes are exactly what we need to record our work day.  It would ne nice if you had 10 hour tapes available, but these work just fine.  Its important to us to have the capability to review any incidents that occur during the workday, and we find that vhs tapes are actually a lot less complicated than computer use.  thanks again",positive
"Total install time was about 5 minutes.  Performed exactly as I expected and has never let me down - been running 7x24 since last November.  Not real fancy, but then for less than $100 what do you expect?  Simply put, it does the job and it does it well.",positive
"Easy to install, simple to configure via the instructions.  I'm even considering buying a 'spare' in case one goes out again on my two computers.",positive
"After installing this care, which took all of 2 min. Everything was great and I was browsing and transferring files again.",positive
"This card embarrassed me.  I recommended it to a friend with a Gigabyte mb, and it crashed the machine repeatedly.  An obsolete NeXXt card delivered the goods.  I was puzzled, as I had used it successfully on an IBM mb and an ASUS mb :(",negative
"I read a good many reviews before selecting the d-link nic card.  I found the install easy and trouble free- but the quality isn't what I'd expected.  The RJ45 connection is poor (cable doesn't lock in) and I've lost my  connection several times, having to remove the card to get a proper  connection.  This may well be a faulty card, but I can only speak from my  experience with the one, which thus far has not been great.",neutral
"Had no problems getting this to work.  The other one I had still works, I mainly got this for back up purposes.",positive
"I have found from experience that D-Link just makes good stuff.  This is no exception.  Plugged it in and the P-N-P thing came up.  30 seconds later it was working.  The installed one had died and needed replacement.  This, my router and the Skype thing are all D-Link and all run great.",positive
"The network component on my old Intel MB was not supported by Windows 2008 Server R2.  I ordered this card to enable me to use the MB with Windows Server 2008 R2.  It works perfectly.  Card is recognized on install and driver loaded automatically.  Later, I upgraded to Windows Server 2012 and the card works perfectly with that version of the server product also.  Easy to install, and didn't have to bother with the install CD.",positive
"Great for the Windows XP and newer computer that auto detects the card! Brings new life to older desktop computers that do not have a Ethernet port, or one that has stopped working.",positive
"Just long enough to convince me I didnt need the receipt, therefore no return possible. And any one who has a problem has to jump through hoops to get it fixed by D-link.",negative
"Fast  shipping,Vendor even sends software , so you dont have to hope XP has drivers,  or have to search the web to down load so called free drivers that loads a lot of add on that slow down your computer . very happy",positive
"Lighting took out the integrated net card on our Dell. I had an open slot so I bought this to replace it. It works fine. Follow the instructions and load the drivers first, and no problems with setup.",positive
"Replaced a card that was giving me trouble. This card working great with my high speed optic fiber internet access. Downloads are fast, as high as 5mbs and no problems with the card. d-link is a good reliable product.",positive
"Simple to use adapter. worked like charmed since taken out of the box. Nothing fancy just does its job, very good job.",positive
"Installed in Win. 98 machine. Took seconds to install drivers, a few minutes to install into machine, restarted machine and was ready to go. Easy instructions. Works fine.",positive
"I've used two of these cards with perfect results. Installed one into a emachines T1220 Celeron system running XP and one on a Quantex PII system running Win 95. Both installed in seconds from provided CD and are up and running on my D-link DI-604 router sharing files, printers, and broadband connection. Great!",positive
I bought this to install in my mom's PC after a power surge fried her integrated Ethernet adapter. No problems with the install. Directions indicate to install the driver etc. (CD provided) prior to mounting the adapter. Once installed it worked as directed. :-),positive
D-Link makes low-end NIC's. My problem with them is why they're made so  awfully. Quality is so inconsistent. Their help desk is indifferent to the  card's many installation problems. D-Link's diagnostics work only in  DOS(?).Skip this one...,negative
"As I said in a review of a very similar product, it should not be hard for companies to get basic stuff like this to work well. I installed it, added the driver manually and was back on the network in no time. A good deal for the price and much cheaper than several of its competitors.",positive
Installed in a Win XP machine.  Plug-and-Play auto-magically loaded the driver.  Works great!  Got fed up with my Belkin Wireless Ethernet.  Got this to replace it and drilled a hole in the wall and ran a wire.  Has been trouble free ever since!,positive
This card has worked perfect with no problems since I got it around a year ago.  I was going to get some no-name card but I've read about problems with cards like that.  I ended getting a D-Link router (the 604) since this card worked so well and that has been great too.,positive
"Item as described.I have a 8 year old pc, running Windows XP Home. Cable tech suggested I use an ethernet card over usb for broadband. Installed card, but it would not work. I think its my cord, and not the card.Will try again to make it work.",positive
"Don't Be Fooled By The Cheap Price!  This card is a breeze to install.  First install the software, then install the card, turn your computer back on, and your ready for the internet or to connect to a network!  I have installed at least five of these cards into computers over the past year, and have not gotten one call that they are not working!  This is a great price point, and great product.",positive
"This card is worth the money. However, make sure you install the drivers for the NIC card first as it will lock up your PC on bootup without doing this first. It clearly says this in the installation documentation though, but...who reads that.I had no issues with the RJ45 not snapping into place as another review stated. It has been working fine for weeks now on my parents computer.",positive
Bought this because I was having trouble with my internet connection and suspected it was ethernet adapter. The price for this was so low that even though it turned out that my problem was not the old adapter I removed I left the new one installed and it is performing well.,positive
"Definately has the best color screen.Performance is fast and I like the new interface and programs, especially MS reader.  You can read ebooks and listen to audiobooks from audio.com, both from within MS Reader.My only  complaint is that the device seems to slow down after opening more than 4  or 5 programs.  Also, I have needed to &quot;reboot&quot; the machine more  than with my E-11, but it has not been troublesome for me.Overall, great  product and great performance.",positive
"I received my unit via an Amazon Marketplace vendor early. I bought it primarily for trying out the programs I hope to write, and were testing via the emulators that Microsoft makes available for VS2005 and VS2008.The battery life is my only complaint.",positive
"Only had it a day, but it appears to be pretty awesome... and it should  for the price.  (You can get a whole PC for the price.)The USB  connection is by far superior to the old serial connects for synch speed.  Transferred 500 contacts in 3 secs.Once the expansion sleeves hit the  market (October)... I think this one is a winner!",positive
"Considering the age of this product and possible compatibility issues with Vista, this works quite well and does what I need it to do most - keep my appointments in sync and carry reference Acrobat and ebooks.",positive
The reception is good and it cost $10. The design is simple and it works. I couldn't ask for anything else.EDIT: I noticed they recently bumped the price up to $20. I would recommend you buy the Sony instead since it is still marked at $10. I have used it as well and it is the same quality as this radio with a slightly different layout for the tuning. Buy that instead and save 10 bucks.,positive
"Not even kidding, we put two batteries in this radio and used it for 4 different camping trips.  It still has juice!!",positive
What A great little radio at a great price picks up alot of stations my other radios dont get.The sound is very clean as well and at this price it cant be beat.Well worth the dollars i spent on it.Quality at a good price.,positive
I like little transistor radios.  When I see something different I buy it for my little collection.  They are not especially great sounding or long range.  Just a toy.,positive
"yes, i purchased this radio because i liked the looks of it  and wanted to add it to my collection.",positive
"This little transistor radio gets great reception -- I can even get two different FM NPR stations inside my house. The sound quality is of course typical of a little radio, but for listening to news and talk shows, it can't be beat. I did notice if I'm walking around in the house with it, the reception goes in and out; I suppose that's typical.",positive
"This is what it is, and it is good for that.  I got it for my 10-year-old for camping.  A very basic, small radio.  Works great for her and for a take-along camping radio she can use as she wishes.",positive
"If you are looking for a small, portable basic AM/FM radio, you can't beat this. It has regular dial tuning, a fold out antenna, strap and most importantly clear reception on AM and FM channels. Nothing fancy at all about this little radio, but it works great and is definitely a great price!",positive
Perfect for radio listening. I didn't want to have to wear earphones just to listen to a portable radio and this little gem fills the bill.,positive
I was looking for a radio that's good on batteries that I can listen to while going to sleep.This one misses that boat because the sound only comes from one earbud. not acceptable.,negative
"I got this for power outage times, but find I use it in the shower and in random moments where I feel a good song is what I need. It also reminds me of my grandparents house where they always had one just like this (only metal) sitting in their bathroom. As a kid I would always play around with it, antenna and tuner dial, it was fun.",positive
"Pocket radios are fairly hard to find nowadays, and this made the perfect gift for my mother. The tuning is great and the volume is outstanding for such a small unit.",positive
"I bought this at Amazon.com after reading good reviews.  The one I have is mono and not stereo, and you use it with earbuds or rather only one earbud.  You can also use with earbuds.On the beach, you get much static and not great sound quality.It replaced a Coby that had great sound but broke within a relatively short period of time.",neutral
Great little radio with excellent FM reception.  Am could be a little better but of course this is a very small radio.,positive
Got this for my go-bag in the hopes that I never have to use it. Tossed in a few batteries to test it out and it worked like a champ.Very small and very lightweight but still loud and got good reception. Good deal.,positive
Barely picks up any station.  Stations that I can get with a much smaller radio come in with a lot of static.  Have tried it numerous locations with the same result.  I can get 1 or 2 stations usually that are bareble to listen without too much static.I don't recommend this product.  Find something more reliable or spend a little more money on something that will work.,negative
"this is like the little radio you had years ago when you were a teenager, before boomboxes where the thing.  it has great reception and sound, we are actually using it hooked up to two tiny speakers we had, but it works great alone too.",positive
I got this radio for someone and the person found it really useful. Had a lot of value for the person.,positive
"I guess its ok in a pinch. But I can't get radio station signals in most area's and get a lot of static if I don't play with the position. Also, don't expect to plug in your stereo headset and hear stereo.. you'll only hear from one ear even if your on the FM dial.",neutral
"Station numbers on the dial/face plate are nice and large (larger than my other pocket radios). Tunes in AM and FM stations as good as other units like this I own (I also own a few &#34;Sony ICF-S10MK2 Pocket AM/FM Radio, Silver&#34; and bought this to have some variety. This is almost the same exact size, and has similar performance. I am happy with it.",positive
"I like the size, sound, performance, but...it tips over too easy. If you're going to keep it laying flat or in a pocket or something fine, but its end face is not stable enough to suit me. Basically the same thing as the Sony of similar design but the Sony is a bit larger and thus more stable sitting on a hard surface on its end.",positive
This is a great little radio. Reception and sound is fantastic. Great for carrying around.,positive
"This little radio is great for its intended purpose. Looks old school-ish, has an ear phone jack, dial tuner/volume. Received 4 stars because it could have better range but that often has more to do with the station.",positive
Inexpensive & important to have in times if emergency & in today's world ---who knows!!!  I am host I bought it to complete his kit! HE fells safe with it & ultimately that is what counts!!!,positive
"I bought this radio to listen to the soccer game transmission when i go to the stadium.This is a classic style hand radio, it is powered by 2 AA batteries (i use 2 rechargeable eneloops which are great btw).Sound is fine, it supports AM and FM bands.Price is great for a good working product, if you need a hand radio i recommend this little one.",positive
"I have to remember I bought this for when the power goes out. I do use it almost everyday though. It's my morning bathroom noise maker, This is like something out of the 80's. was looking for something more stylish. but then i had to say to myself, we are looking for something practical. Practical it is, stylish like I said like my grandmothers onsee bathing suit. it gets the job done.",neutral
"I live in a fringe reception area, and this radio does a pretty good job of pulling in stations where other small radios have failed. If you hook a flexible dipole antenna to it, it works even better. Sound is decent although not much bass, due to size.",positive
"We purchased this radio to be used during power outages.  I store it in an end table so that it is convenient if needed.  It is light weight, but great for occasional use.  It works well and I feel comfortable knowing that I am not incommuncado with the rest of the world.  I would not recommend it for constant use, but it is a great backup that is both economical and functional.",positive
"cute and sensitive,, sounds much bigger, nicely made",positive
"I just wanted something simple,that I can use while in the casino. I don't want to have to remember songs I like or figure out how to get them, plus the fact that I dont want to pay for them. So the FM radio was my way of keeping it real. Fits in the pocket on the side of my purse and ear plugs work great!! Price was awsome!! Good deal",positive
"This is exactly what you think. It is very light and is perfect to listen to an announcer while sitting at a game. I use it in DC for Redskin games and it picks up channels well, although I do need to have the antenna fully extended.",positive
"This is an excellent radio to take out to the ballpark.  It is an good size to hold grasp in the palm of my hand.  The sound quality is good for its size.  And, the radio is simple to use: one dial for to click on and adjust volume, and another dial to tune in your favorite station.  Seems to work for many hours on one pair of AA batteries.  I highly recommend!",positive
"Soon after purchase the on/off/volume switch went bad.  Evidently some loose connection inside.  If I press downward on the dial I can usually get the radio to come on, but obviously this is a real p.i.t.a. I looked inside to see if I could fix it, but couldn't see where the problem was. Aghh!",negative
"I like to listen to Dave Ramsey and Ric Edelman on Sunday and this little pocket radio picks up both AM and FM great.  Clear and strong signal, well made and great bargain for the price.  With all the new technology out there, these may seem like something from the old days, but the quality and price is just right.",positive
"LIghtweight,sleek,  good sound.I Can take it outdoors or  and can keep it handy for earthquake readiness. My friend's 12 yr old looked at it and asked &#34;What's that?&#34; Genereation gap.",positive
I love this little radio to listen to myOakland A's baseball games on (Like right now!) I had to scout around to find it now that spring training games have started.,positive
Pretty good little radio. Reception could be a little better but that just might be my rural location. I got a couple of these for emergencies and keep 1 in my INCH bag.,positive
I like:- Size- Construction- SensitivityI do not like:- Dial- Knob for volume and tuningWith a month of using the power key is failing to turn on.,positive
This is a perfect radio. It's easy to use for everyone as it doesn't have complex parts or settings. It's portable and is loud enough for a small group of people. In general I am very satisfied.,positive
"For sound and tone, this is great for the price. Really easy to use, not hard to get the cassettes either. Reminds me of a time (pre-Internet) when life was a bit less-hurried and more placid.",positive
Well after 40 years they better have these tape players cooking your dinner.Works like it should.  But it for my Father.,positive
"I got this secondhand from a friend, and i know for a fact it was bought in the mid 1980's. Amazing that it's still being sold. Rather a simple product, sucks up a butload of power, mono sound, the sound is kind of weird sounding on music, but its probably the sheer age of the thing. If it's lasted 20 years with little care given to it, i think it's a good buy.",positive
,positive
"Audio quality is fairly good - about the best you could expect for a relatively low priced recorder.  The case seems to be made of cheap plastic and the raised lettering on the front of the machine have sharp edges which reinforces my view that this is not a high quality recorder. Ignoring the quality of the casing, the machine is still rated a good buy based on its solid performance.",positive
"I purchased this brand of cassette tape recorder because I've bought Panasonic cassette recorders in the past and have been very pleased with them.  If used properly, this recorder is quite durable, although it's not as portable as pocket recorders.  The sound quality is good.  I only use it for lectures and not for music.  I'm happy that it's still available.",positive
"Very good performance characteristics in both record and playback modes; Mechanically reliable, and definitely durable as well. Although somewhat on the large side, that is an advantage of sorts, i.e., absorbs 'punishment' and won't be easily misplaced or lost. Note: pre-recorded tape playback is excellent!",positive
A great cassette player/recorder that works like a charm. The construction feels solid to me and the speaker sounds clear as a bell. I'm hooking this up to my computer and transferring some old tapes I have to CD. And this player is so good I'll even transfer some audio CD's to cassette!,positive
My daughter loves these shoe box type recorders and they are hard to find. This is exactly what she was looking for.,positive
"I take to class this machine to get my class notes, I use it to record a song that I hear on the radio. It is a wonderful tool to make my affirmations on. My sister has gotten one sine she has seen how helpful this recorder is. Thanks",positive
"Good recorder. To try to comply with Amazon's number of words requirement for this review, I'll say I needed this equipment in order to play a valuable cassette tape I had been saving for years.  The player worked perfectly well and I was able to use the speakers I usually use with my computer to play the tape loudly and clearly.",positive
"I use this to record my guitar-playing, and it serves me well.  Sound is good, as is the volume level.  Priced well and shipped quickly.",positive
"Don't have many cassettes anymore, but some of my older books on tape work great on this little player.  Happy with the purchase.",positive
My comments reflect judgements made on the copy I recived. A working model was not judged. The item recived had a loud audio whisle when in the playback mode.  Efforts to contact the supplier proved to be fruitless so the item was returned.,negative
"Good unit, but I don't really like the sound. I'm using it only for voice and durability of the player is important for me. It appears to be a well made unit",positive
I purchased this to replace a broken recorder that was cheaper and a different model and maker that only lasted 4 months. Records very clear even from a distance. Spend a little extra money and get a much better recorder.,positive
"It's a great basic recorder and works in that capacity very well. I had bought for converting my cassettes to MP3 format and for that it simply isn't up to the task. It only has a single output instead of separate channel RCA jacks for left and right making anything I try and convert go from stereo to monotone. Other than my haste in purchasing, it is a solid unit for the price.",neutral
"We have an audio book collection for Halloween that is our absolute favorite. Problem is, it's on tape, and hasn't been released to CD or on itunes. I had to buy this to continue our tradition of listening to it in October. It works well, and reminds me of the player I had as a kid.",positive
"We've only used this as a tape player (haven't tried to record), but it works great.  Our old tape player wouldn't play louder than a whisper, but this one has no issue playing at a normal volume.  It does not have a USB output, which would be nice, but I do like the fact that it has a loudspeaker.",positive
"I have been looking for one of these recorders for soooo long.It's difficult to find an older model desktop recorder these days at a reasonable price. I tried it out the moment it arrived and the sound was great. Being a Christmas gift I wanted to make sure everything was all right,I needn't have worried.Thanks again!",positive
"I should have known by the price. It does work, but the loudest sound (via headphone) is barely adequate. Overall, I wouldn't recommend.",negative
"These recorders are getting harder to find all the time, and this Panasonic is one of the best quality recorders for the money!",positive
"I bought this so that my grandson could play the cassette story tapes that my own kids had.  It is well made, easy to use, and the sound quality is fine.  The price was  a little higher than I paid so many years ago, but reasonable.  A nice tape player/recorder.",positive
"The recorder worked ok but seemed to be made very cheaply, with a great deal of plastic. After having it for a year in which I used it, but not a lot, it now makes a clicking sound when it plays. I'm sure it won't last much longer. I would rather pay more and have an item work. I can not recommend this because of how quickly it has started to deteriorate.",negative
works good.  but i found this to be pricey.  i found one at walmar that was way cheaper that came with a microphone and a cassette tape.,negative
"My mom was looking for one of these for months (not sure why she couldn't find one on her own) and I came across this one. I bought it as a birthday gift, she LOVES IT! It arrived quickly and in safe and secure packaging. Very happy with this purchase.",positive
"I bought this to transfer tapes to CD's. However, what they claim is a headphone port does not fit any standard earphone jack. It's meant to attach to speakers, not headphones.",negative
bought this Panasonic RQ2102 Cassette Recorder for my dad he was very happy to find out i got it for him and had me set it up for him right away,positive
"If you are lucky enough to have a TRG Pro like me, or the new HandEra 330, this modem works fine in the flash slots of those devices as well (Palm OS). On the TRGPro, you may run into some battery problems, it seems to drain them rather quickly, so be sure to have spares on hand, and don't stay online too long. The increased battery life on the HandEra deals nicely with this problem.",positive
"Great for surfing the web and sending e-mails, I really like the idea of using my iPAQ and these modem rathen than carring a bulky laptop all over. The connection speed is perfect for my needs.",positive
It is good.,positive
"Terrific headphones for the price. You certainly won't come anywhere dedicated listening headphones with these, but they are a significant step up from earbuds. Surprisingly good low end - not too detailed, but strong.",positive
These were inexpensive and are comfortable. I use them almost daily and after 4 weeks there are no issues whatsoever.,positive
"Durability: I haven't really put them up to the durability test yet as i've only had them for 2 weeks.Sound: Above average for a cheap headphone. I can only compare them to my Fata1ity USB PC Headset and my Sony MDR-V6 cans which both produce much better sound but cost way more money.Comfort: Comfortable, I might just be forever sold on over-the-ear vs in-ear headphones because of these. They are light and I forget that i'm wearing them.",positive
"These are a good value for the money.  They don't have super-high sound quality - but it's very acceptable.  For audiobooks, they can't be beat.",positive
"The sound on these is astonishing for the ridiculously low price. Like all headphones, they are not perfect -- for instance, they sit on my ears in a little bit of an unnatural way, and so I find myself readjusting them every now and again in the vain hope of getting a better placement -- but if you're looking for a great sounding, knock-around pair of headphones for portable use, I highly recommend these.",positive
"It was cheap, or rather I should say inexpensive. Lightweight, comfortable and the sound is very good...  I despise the ear-bud type headphones and these sound better to my ears. Can't beat it for under$5.",positive
We ordered a bunch of these to go with remote receivers for our plant.  These are a great value.  Sound very good for talking voice and for light use.  Cheap enough to not really worry about losing on a trip also.,positive
My daughter and I must have small ear canals as we have trouble using earbuds. My daughter uses these with various techie gadgets and is very happy. The price was right. We were not expecting Bose.,positive
"At an affordable price, its good to hear the base sound and clarity.  Adjustable and indeed lightweight. I would recommend this product.",positive
I bought three pairs of these headphones for my classroom. I am a 1st grade teacher and needed these for my computers. They are great and have lasted with many 6 year olds. Couldn't ask for more.,positive
"I like to wear these types of headphones when I run.  You can still hear traffic coming with them on.  The music sounds fabulous, good bass response and clear highs.  The headphones aren't too tight or too loose. They dry quickly when sweaty. The cord is long and thicker than most cheap headphone cords.",positive
Inexpensive (I am not an audiophile and don't need anything fancy). Comfortable (my main requirement). Sound through the ear pieces is suitable for my uses.,positive
"I remember these from the 90's - still good for casual listening, light enough for activewear, and well built so it should hold up to daily use. Decent sound quality, rolled off bass and high end, but also good for checking your mix against a 'normal' set of headphones.  Will buy again.",positive
Of course I was thinking these were throw away headphone for the price of $4. I was actually quite surprised how good they sound. Good bass and good quality.I dont understand the bad reviews. My only regret is I didnt buy several pairs. They are also very lightweight and fit snugly. Dont listen to the whiners. buy em.,positive
"These headphones were only $4.99.  The sound quality was good for that price.  Not great, but good enough.",positive
"Used for less than 3 months for music and audio on my Kindle Fire before they snapped in half. No abuse.  Just spread the pads to put over my head and &#34;snap&#34; it was all over.  No, my head is not that large.",negative
"I have tried a number of headphones (ear buds, clips, etc.) for my kindle fire but far and away this is the best set I have used.",positive
Broke after a few months. I can't expect too much from an inexpensive product. These are good for those who hate earbuds.,positive
"A Panasonic headphone for $5? This is a very good headphone for the money. If you have Amazon Prime, the shipping is free and it is delivered to you in two days.It is usable even if your iPod Touch (2G and 3G) has a protective case on it.I like the 90-degree headphone plug that makes it less likely to break.The headband is adjustable, and its bass performance is quite good, considering its price.",positive
"They sound decent, with adequate bass and overall good sound. They don't cup my ears properly or tightly enough, but sound ok despite that. Definitely worth the money, or up to $20.",neutral
My kids use these with their mp3 players. They are lightweight enough for them to keep on their heads w/out being bulky and they can hear their music w/out the volume being up too loud.,positive
"These headphones are comfortable, lightweight, durable, and sounds really nice. I'm bought this 7 months ago and they've lasted me without any problems on daily use. I'm buying these again when/if they break. I've seen similar Coby branded ones but they feel so cheap compared to these. Very well worth every penny.",positive
The sound quality of these $6-headphones is appreciably lower than that of my old SVEN headphones bought for $3. Nevertheless I agree with many reviewers that this is one of the best cheap headphones currently available at Amazon.,neutral
"they truly are light weight and adjustable, and the volume is clear and I can use it without others hearing what I am listening too",positive
"Maybe my set was defective, but it's not worth returning. There was static and poor sound.  The fit on my head was too tight.  I tossed these in the trash.",negative
"This is my second pair. The first lasted couple years, and I use them everyday for listening on computer. The sound is clear and legible. has bass, treble and all that. Can't go wrong with these.I used to buy expensive brands that cost 20x more and they aren't worth it because they all break eventually.",positive
"You won't find any better headphone in this price with clarity and bass! I bought one and ordered one more today. A must have for private quality listening, very comfortable and light wt.",positive
These headphones were low priced and they are OK for the price. I should have spent more. It's my fault.,positive
these sound good and theyre fairly comfortable (can't wear them for hours though).  theyre the best cheapy headphones out there.,positive
"I have purchased 4 of these just to have in each car, home, and work. I carry an iPod around and love the clarity and lightweight comfort these provide. Lastly, $5.00 including free shipping... who could ask for more?",positive
Does the job I use it on my computer not good for quality sound for music and such blah blah,neutral
"The sound is great as is the volume. I've worked with headphones for years as I used to own a recording studio and I can tell you from experience, when you're not actually listening to anything, you should take them off or put them around your neck as any headphones  will start to get uncomfortable after long use.UPDATE: I JUST ORDERED TWO MORE...",positive
"Overall a deep, rich, yet discrete sound with a larger driver set.  Need equalizer to truly appreciate.  Can't be beat at this price point.",positive
These work well for casual listening.  The sound is decent.  For the money they are a good value.  No issues.,positive
I liked these because they were light weight and cheep. And they work great I use them on my laptop and dvd player.,positive
"Fantastic sound quality, very light weight, very comfy! I bought one pair, liked them so much I ordered another pair the very next week. Thank you!",positive
These headphones are incredible for the price. They sound as good as my PortaPros and they cost much less.  They are also very comfortable. Buy several pairs!,positive
"They are comfortable, have a nice length cord, and sound good. I was just looking for something I could use with either my computer or listening to music on my phone at work, and these are perfect for my needs.",positive
"I researched many brands of headphones but for my money, these were the best relating to design and price. I ordered 3 sets for other family members and we enjoy them all.",positive
"hard to believe these are only 5 bucks. order at least 2 pair, it will save you the shipping costs of ordering the second pair you will surely want. deep base-hard to believe!",positive
"I use these headphones for running and gym workouts with my Apple iPod Shuffle.  They stay on my head unlike all earphones I have tried.  Also, I like the better sound quality compared to earphones.Pros+ Light+ Snug fit+ Extra long cord+ Good bass and excellent sound quality+ High Quality",positive
I have no complaints about these headphones. I've had better and worse and these get the job done which is all I was looking for. A pair of nice headphones that I could use on my computer.,positive
"I like these little headphones! They're lightweight and the sound they put out is quite substantial.  Not super-high end audio-snob substantial, but good enough to watch an action movie or edit some footage without costing an arm and a leg. I like the feeling of not having to baby them. So far they've held up, but if I do break them, I'm not too worried. $6.44 and I'm back in business 2 days later.  5/5 would recommend.",positive
"This is a good headset at a very reasonable price!  Not the most comfortable fit, but still a good bargain!",neutral
I bought this as a gift and the recipient using it on a Kindle said it worked great.  The price was very right.,positive
For the price i can't go wrong. Great for the kids to use on trips.No problems yet.,positive
One of the best headphones out there for such a low price. The company was good and the product was great!!!,positive
"The title says it all. These are affordable and perfect for kids. If they are destroyed, it's not a big loss. But, if you are really into music and want a set of headphones that reproduce a full range of frequencies, these are not it. They produce very little bass and have limited high frequency response.",neutral
"I am quite unusual as I sleep with headphones and a radio.  The original Sony bass headphones were nice and flat and comfortable to wear at night on my ears. These headphones are bulky and the sound quality just isn't there.  For me they're okay but for someone else out there that just wants to listen to music and doesn't sleep with their headphones, they would probably be okay.",neutral
I bought a Roku 3 because I could use headphones with it if I wanted to stay up late to watch a movie.  These are more than adequate for the price and work perfectly.  I am happy with my purchase.,positive
"These are not high-end, these are not high-tech, and these are not high-performance.As a low-priced, act-as-you-expect headset for an iPod or or other audio device, you cannot go wrong.Given the inexpensive price tag, if it wasn't a Panasonic product I'd have arched an eyebrow in anticipation of low quality.I'd have been wrong on any account. These work as desired and expected. Recommended.",positive
"Bought these to replace an older pair that the ear pads had worn out. Was somewhat disappointed after receiving them because, when I attempted to use them in my Samsung MP3 player the dongle would not transmit sound unless you played around with it. Once it did start transmitting sound it was inconsistent and would have be re-adjusted. Just my experience YMMV.",neutral
"The sound quality could be much better on these, but I bought them for my kids for technology class at school and their Leapsters.  They don't notice, so they fulfill the need I bought them for.  If you want great sound, $4 headphones aren't for you, but if you just need a cheap pair for the kids.  These will definitely do the job.",positive
"much better bass compared to smaller drive earphone.  I wish that the head band has less pressure on ear.  Not sure if this will reduce the quality of sound.  The wire length is longer than my other headphones, I like it.",positive
"Great buy for my 5 year old.  She used this on our road trip to Canada and it worked great.  She was happy, therefore it made us happy.",positive
"Paid $4 for these headphones, didn't expect much. But they are attractive, decent sounding, and packaged nicely. As such, they will make nice stocking stuffers. Give everyone around you a set and enjoy some peace and quiet. I've used mine for a couple months now and they still work.",positive
I wish I could give a comprehensive review of these headphones but my sister used them one time and never returned them.,positive
"I purchased both the Panasonic RP-HT21s (under $5) and the SonySony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil(> $67) and the Panasonic headphones are far superior. They are lighter, more comfortable, and have better sound balance. You will not find a better headphone for near this price. Highly recommended.",positive
"Light, easy on ears, clear sound, good bass.Feel so comfortable, you will forget that you are wearing it completely.Will buy more.",positive
"Not very often that i will rate a product five stars, but for $5 and a quality sound, these headphones shouldn't be passed over.  My daughter took over mine so i will be ordering two more.",positive
I use them for exercise and walking so I bought them knowing I would be sweating and did not want to use an expensive pare and am surprise at the good sound for the price,positive
These were purchased as a replacement for a set that deteriorated and to offer a variation for earbuds for some newly acquired audio equipment--an iPod.They are comfortable and offer relatively good sound quality for an economy item. Husband feels he doesn't get quite the same range of treble and bass as he does with ear buds but that may be the mode of sound transmission.We would recommend them as a good purchase.,positive
"I've been looking for cheap headphones for the kids.  They break expensive and cheap things equally so I didn't want to spend even $30 on a set of headphones.  These aren't just cheap, they work fairly well too.  Certainly much better than $5 headphones should work.  Great shipping fast delivery as always.",positive
The Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS Port are very lightweight. They sound ok and make a good lightweight bedtime headphone.  They are so lightweight they slip off my head if I try to wear them during normal daytime activity.  The XBS Port is very useful as an extra XBS Port.  My XBS  really needed an extra Port. Now I can XBS Wherever I want.,positive
"I go though headphones like crazy (when you run a lot - the wires wear out FAST) so my goal is to always find good phones that stay on my head and sound well, and are cheap.  These are it!",positive
"These should be evaluated against other &#34;disposable&#34; headphones, not against serious audiophile headphones. They reproduce voices clearly, and music sounds good (albeit with limited high treble and low bass production.) These are the perfect headphones for travel, for travel in areas you might get your headphones lost or stolen in, etc.",positive
"For what I needed, i.e. parts to fix another pair of headphones they worked fine.  Quality is ok, sound is descent but you get what you pay for.",neutral
"Good product, but the cord is way too short if you plan to use it with a computer that sits more than a couple feet from you.  It would be nice to have an adjustable volume control on the cord, too.",neutral
Great price for the budget heaphone.  My little kids use it to listen to their iPods.  No issues as of yet and seems to work just fine.,positive
I purchased these because my wife won't wear ear buds and I wasn't willing to lay out big bucks for earphones that would be used on one vacation and then left in a drawer for years.  The quality is fine but there is no noise blocking or cancellation so we had to turn up the volume to drown out background noise.  If I planned on using headphones more often I'd buy a better pair but these suited our needs.,neutral
"I wear hearing aids so unless I remove them, I cannot use ear buds. That works okay sometimes. But if I am about during the day and want to listen to my iTunes on my iPhone, I use the Panasonic headphones. They do not give me &#34;feedback&#34; as I expected and they are light weight.",positive
These work well for listening to videos at night when everyone is asleep. They are comfortable and the price is right.,positive
"I can't imagine a better sound from my MP3 player, at any price.  And these are practically free!I'll report back if there are durability issues...",positive
Inexpensive and lightweight with good sound quality.  What more could you want.  Much more comfortable than in-ear headphones to me.,positive
"I had another pair of headphones, but in summer my ears would get very sweaty if i wear them, and I hate the ones that you plug in your ears because they hurt after a while in my case. I bought this and they work just fine and the price is right",positive
My old headphones were disintegrating so I looked around and found these Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS Port . They arrived on time in great packaging. I had to modify them to fit my bald head. They work great now.,positive
thses are some nice lightweight earphones you can give to the kids and dont cost an arm and leg to replace them the kids.sound is also.good,positive
"I had been using earbuds and those things are so unreliable and uncomfortable. Got my delivery, popped open the box and the comfort and quality of these headphones are apparent. They feel good, sound good, and are built to last. Buy it!!",positive
"Reading impressively positive reviews here, I purchased two of them.  Unfortunately I was disappointed by sound reproduction of theses headphones. The sound is very weak compared to quite a few other equally priced headphones. If I press them on my ears, then I get a mediocre sound. It lacks depth of sound and matches its price perfectly. I got what I paid for.",negative
"I needed to provide multiple headseats for podcasting applications.  This works well and the price is right. If I needed something rugged and durable this would not suffice , but for the purpose it's fine.",neutral
I have not used it for a long time but so far so good. The sound quality is acceptable for such price.,positive
I figured with such a cheap price tag that these headphones would be complete junk and would distort with heavy bass.  However I was surprised at the clean and deep bass response and crisp highs.  I am going to order another pair just in case I step on these and break them like I have done with my last pair of headphones :P,positive
I just wanted a pair of headphones I could use on my laptop and Kindle and on airplanes. Considering that I  paid less than $5 for these headphones they are good value for money. The frequency range seems adequate for listening to classical music and the bass was better than I expected.,positive
"This headset is lightweight, but comfortable to wear. The cord was surprisingly long.. which is a plus for me. Overall I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others.",positive
I lost my previous MP3 Player earphones because I accidentally damaged them when cleaning the wax out.  So I use these ones--don't have to insert them in the ear.  But these headphones can be useful when listening to a radio or MP3 player.  Quite the multitasker.,positive
"The sound is just fair - Cheap Sony headphones sound much better.  And despite purchasing these through Amazon Prime, the seller was going to let me return them after I paid shipping and reshelfing fees, which together added up to more than the headphones.  I had purchased two sets and this return applied to only the unopened set.  Now I have two worthless headphones.",negative
"I dont do well with headphones they irritate my ears. I itch when I use them so, if you dont have that problem then order these. For the price your cant go wrong. For the kiddies they are a bit too cheap and wont hold up under the hard useage.",negative
"I bought these for use with my Kindle Fire, they work fine and offer good sound quality for the price.",positive
Bought these headphones by mistake.. was originally going to buy something with volume control but for some reasons ordered these Panasonics. Anyways i have put them in good use.. i used my shure e2c earbuds on my laptop but now i'm using these $6 comfy headphones because my ears don't hurt anymore. i didn't release it before.. i guess my ears got used to earbuds but after using these headphones i feel much comfier.,positive
"These headphones are absolutely the best I've found for listening to the spoken word, specifically audio books played on iPods.  The bass range is just right, the fit is comfortable and the cord appears to be the optimum length.  At this price, I bought several to store away for future use.",positive
"Wow.  I did not expect the quality that came out of this at all.  For a $5 pair of headphones, you can't go wrong.  Be aware that the noise on these headphones leak quite a bit and the headphones fit a little to small.  But then again, it was only $5.",positive
"Very lightweight, also nice sound, very confortable, easy to use, its really works fine, without any problem or complain. I had been satisfied with my shop.",positive
I love the sound of this headphone. The bass is rich and the sound is very clear with no distortions. It is also comfortable for the ears for long use. Definitely would recommend this one.,positive
"I got these for my Kindle Fire and they do a nice job. My first generation Kindle Fire has somewhat inadequate speakers, so for any real listening either an external speaker or headphones are pretty much required. These do a nice job.",positive
I bought these to fit a portable CD player. The ear phones worked just fine. It was the CD player that took the lick. I mean for the price I was just glad they worked.,positive
"These lightweight and convenient headphones were nearly as good as my $80 Klipsch S4 earbuds and over $100 Bose over the ear headphones, for $5!!!!! Heck, they're almost paying YOU to buy them! Tight bass, great mids and highs. These were highly rated online, which is why I bought them, and for the price, I don't think there's a better headphone on the market.",positive
"These are the ""generic"" headphones my work gives out. It's light and sounds great. I have noise-cancelling headphones but you begin to feel them on your hair and pressing against your ears after an hour or so, I've since switched back to these and they feel awesome for my purposes (smooth jazz, no bass). I was going to purchase some Audio Technica's for 100 but I'll stick with these free ones. And for the price, that's a no-brainer.",positive
"These are great headphones for the price. Recommend that you pick a set up. My daughter is using them to practice her piano. I tried them out and did not know if the sound was from them or in the room. They sounded that good. I had to take them off to realize that the room did not have the sound, it was just the headphones.",positive
"Love these headphones.  I have several of them.  Works with my computer, my cd players, even works with my cell phone except it does not have an answer button.  The sound is very good considering the price you pay, and they are lightweight and comfortable.  Even gave one to my husband to use with his portable ham radio.",positive
"These are the best portable headphones in this price range.  Good bass and smooth, natural sound. In fact they would probably still be the best bang for the buck at three times the price.  If you can afford more, consider the Sennheiser PX100 for about 40-50 dollars. But if you're on a budget or don't want to worry about losing or breaking a more expensive pair of headphones, these are definitely the ones to get.",positive
"I use these mainly for watching DVD's on my portable players.  For what these cost you absolutely cannot go wrong , and they are better than many that cost a lot more.  The sound is clear, good bass response,  and they're very lightweight and comfortable.  Very highly recommended.",positive
"Just received these and trying them with Poweramp on my droid phone, they're a great set of headphones for the price.  Placido never sounded so good.  Very light weight, comfortable fit; won't fly off with a head shake.  Volume's nearly twice what it was with the cheapo airline set I was using 'til these arrived.  Glad I bought two sets.  Five stars for these more-than-adequate, bargain-priced headphones.  If they last me a year or two, I'll be happy.",positive
Bought these for my father and he just loves them. They lay on the ear comfortably and do not bother his ears at all. I am glad I made the purchase,positive
"I must say, for the money, these are hard to beat! Cheap enough that if they stop working chuck 'em and buy some more! Mean time their sound is great! I hear details in 320 mp3's I've never heard before. It's like hearing the music for the first time!Buy them you will like them.",positive
"Got to use with the SanDisk Sansa Clip+.  It was for my elderly Aunt.  good sound, but hard to adjust to her head so it will stay in place.  Need a smaller one, I guess.",neutral
Bought these to use with my desk top computer to enable me to listen to Youtube videos while the grandchildren are asleep.  they are fine for this purpose.  Not really super quality sound reproduction but they suit my purposes well.  I recommend them for such purpose.,neutral
"As a person who seems to always be replacing headphones, i think ive found the set for all my future replacements.These headphones have surprisingly good sound for the money. I have a big head and these fit fine and are not uncomfortable.If your looking for something cheap with good sound then these headphones are what you need.You wont be disappointed!",positive
"Comfortable, light weight, good sound quality, easy to carry around and perfect for my iPad, iPhone and Roku remote - what more could you ask for?I have to add how much I hate clam shell-type packaging!  I almost cut my hand open and severed the cord trying to open the package.  Some engineer somewhere should be able to design something better.",positive
"These work very very well, I got them as a gift for someone and they are very happy with them thank you.",positive
"I don't personally like earbuds. They feel strange to me. I replaced some with these headphones which have a great sound, are very light, and are a terrific value.",positive
"These are lightweight, soft and comfortable on the ears, and easy to use.  They are also adjustable and come with a long enough cord.  I doubt they would block out airport noise, but I bought them to use at home.",positive
"Good sounding headphones, nice bass, awesome price! Great for aerobic workouts (treadmill, elliptical, etc) in a gym setting. ""On top of the ear"" headphones like these allow you a certain amount of awareness of your surroundings (""buds"" tend to totally isolate the user). These headphones are also quite comfortable.",positive
"bought 2 and its been over a year and they are still going strong. would definitely buy them again. I figured that if my kids broke them they were cheap enough that it wouldn't hurt. so i didn't expect much, especially this long with them",positive
"I've had these for months now and they are great.However, as a prior reviewer noted, you must have an 'average size' head. These do not have any horizontal expansion for a person who has a 'wide' head.I have an 'average size' head (lol) and these sound great.I have thought about purchasing another pair; I like them so much.I have given two of these as gifts to friends.",positive
"I followed the lead of other reviewers and bought two of these.That said, I was all set to give them a ho-hum &#34;yeah, they'redecent headphones&#34;.WHOA!! These cheapies actually do deliver !!The only minus (for me) is my ears are set higher on myhead than average. I would like a little more adjustmenton the length I need to inspect and figure out a way to fieldengineer a tad better fit.",positive
"I bought these headphones because I kept on misplacing or breaking my expensive ones. For the price you pay, the product is great. The sound quality is good, and its no big deal if you break it because its so inexpensive. The one thing I don't like about these is that sometimes your hair will get stuck on the frame. When you try to take it off, it will also take a piece of hair with it!",positive
"They're cheap headphones, what do you expect? They work exactly as I would expect cheap headphones to work, with reasonably good sound. So, five stars.",positive
"These headphones are extremely light and very comfortable, and sound very good.  I use them with my ipod instead of earbuds.",positive
Used the Koss Porta Pro for the last 18 months and was pleased until the wires frayed. Looking for a replacement I came across the Panasonic RP-HT21 and figured for $5 how can I lose. They're OK - non-flexible headphones sit funny so I had to turn them around to use. Uncomfortable after wearing for more then an hour. Like the title says - spend $5 and you get $5 worth of headphones.,neutral
its $3.5 head phones for $5.I need them and they work fine for my daughters dvds player but they will probably break at first sign of strain.,neutral
Awesome sound.  Great bass.  As good as pricier headphones.Light and comfortable.,positive
I purchased these headphones for a kindergarten class to use on their computers.  They do the job and the kids are happy.,positive
"fine sound, durable, and should last al long  time.  I had previously bought the older model and they were also fine and long lasting.",positive
"this  cord is about 4' long.  I am using this on a desktop at work and its useless since the plug is on the back of the pc.(my old headphones had a cord at least 2x as long)if you use a laptop or phone, it will work for you, but not for any desktop with plug in the back.the sound is good. for the price.",negative
"I'm not a gamer, music lover or have any huge need for an expensive pair of stereo headphones. I just want to experience decent sound from lightweight headphones when watching movies on my tablet.  That's what I get with Panasonic's RP-HT21. Nice bass sound without a tinny treble. Good price.",positive
"I got these headphones to replace the ear buds which had short cord. I am happy with longer cord length.  The cord, frame and phones are sturdy and durable.  The comfort and sound quality are OK, but not as good as my notebook headphone set that is ten times more expensive.  These Panasonic headphones are inexpensive solution and they are worth the price.",positive
A good product. I really hate the way Amazon has a demand on how many I should use to review a product - What a bunch of horse pucky!!!,positive
"These inexpensive headphones are a very good deal. They are comfortable and the sound quality is clear, but with one caution: they don't produce much volume. I have to turn the volume up pretty high on my devices to get them loud enough.",positive
"My kids broke yet another set of headphones so I pulled these out of the closet. The sound is fantastic, but they appear to be made for a baby's head--they were insanely tight. Every time I use them I bend the head band and they're finally getting comfortable but only barely.If these headphones could have slightly bigger pads and a comfortable fit, they'd be perfect.",positive
"Headphones you might find at The Dollar Store! They are cheap because they are cheaply made.  Too big for any of the 5 of us in my family and the ear pieces are too small to fit over an average adult's ear.  Don't be misled by these other positive reviews, I would be surprised if you were happy with these headphones.",negative
"A decent sound, definitely not the best but very decent for the money",positive
"The sound leaks like crazy.  I originally bought these thinking  the slim profile can help me listen to my iPod while lying down in bed.  They are useful if you like the whole world to know what your listening to, and they are a step up from cheap United Airlines headphones that you get on long distance flights.",negative
"It's not bad...bass is quite strong for the most part.  It lacks the brilliant highs I'm used to, but I could use them as my main pair of headphones, if I were forced to. :-)",neutral
Great sound and very comfortable to wear.  I use them for when I'm on my computer and sometimes I forget I have them on because they are so comfortable.,positive
"I was pleasantly surprise at the quality of these headphones for the price.  I use them almost everyday, and they are just right for my purposes.  Recommend.",positive
I needed headphones for my six year old to listen to music and to do his Bible study while his Mom did her Bible study next to him,positive
These headphones have the sound quality of those costing much more.  They are extremely light weight and adjust for size with a flick of the finger.  Great product.,positive
"I wear  over-the-ear-stick-'em-in-your-ear hearing aids which means either I take 'em out when I want to wrap myself in music using traditional ear buds or I look for something that leaves those hearing aids where they belong and slip somthing over them.  Regular head sets were too bulky, but this beauty from Panasonic are absolutely great.  Range is good.  Volumn no problem.  Fit is adjustable.  Couldn't ask for anything better, particularly in this price range.",positive
"Inexpensive headphones, lightweight, and sound fantastic. Good bass response and light enough to not cause discomfort after long periods of listening. I like them better than my JVC Flats.",positive
"These are great lightweight headphones.  They sound good and the price is fantastic.  These are a good deal, with good sound too.",positive
"Great cheap headphones!  They are cheap, but they don't sound tinny at all.  They are wonderful for people who don't like ear buds or just people who want a set of decent headphones for a low price.  Nice quality and last forever.  There are no cons to these at all.  You can't get anything better for the price.",positive
"These headphones are a terrific bargain.I looked thru the selection at Best Buy, then I came back to amazon.The sound quality is excellent.  The head band is adjustable.The headphones stay on my head, even when I'm laying in bed.Highly recommend.",positive

"For the price and comfort, why buy expensive headsets.Great for computer and mp3's. Light and comfortable for long periods of time.",positive
"Doesn't say it has a volume control and it doesn't, but for the price it's phenomenal!  For one percent of the price of a boise, it's a comparitively better value.",positive
"I have a pair at home and at work.For me, bass response and midrange tone are really important for enjoying music.Most inexpensive headphones sound tinny and flat. These sound good.And if I lose or break them, who cares? I'll just buy 4 more pair.Too cheap and too good to pass up.",positive
"They're lightweight and comfortable, but their sound is a bit less crisp than the Sony MDR-210LPs (which, to be fair, cost more).  Still, these are decent generic computer headphones, fine for listening to YouTube videos and such.",neutral
Great sound for the money. Heavier construction than other phones within this price range. The cord and plug have been without problems. I keep a spare on hand and they seem to work for a fairly long time.,positive
"For such a cheap little thing, bass sounds good. It seems to me that the overall volume is not so strong, but maybe its with all headphones. For the price its a good buy.",positive
Best $5 I have ever spent.  I should have bought 2.They are great for listening to late night Micheal Savage talk radio.I highly recommend.,positive
"For the price these are great.  They have good sound quality.  I bought some to put in the car and don't care if the kids destroy them.  I like not using earbuds all the time, and this is a great solution.  I've had one pair for about 2 years and they are lasting well.",positive
"I bought these headphones for my children.  Many times when we go out to eat with them we bring our portable dvd player to entertain them.  These headphones are comfortable for them and by helping them enjoy their meal, we enjoy ours too!",positive
"Yes they were light weight, but they were not noise canceling and they broke after about a month of regular use.",negative
"Needed an extra pair of headphones to use around the yard, walking, etc.  Still wanted to be able to hear other noises.  Good fit and are holding up well.",positive
They do the job but are nowhere near as good as the Koss portapros I have used for years. Guess I have been spoiled. Just don't expect them to behave like &#34;the high priced spread&#34;.,neutral
"Great sound for a cheap price. Adjustable head band and soft gripping ear pieces. Looks cool , but is not noise canceling. strongly recommended.",positive
"I have only had it for a month now. The quality of sound is good and very clear, and the volume of my iPod does not seem to impede the output of sound. Most of the time, I wear the Panasonic lightweight headphones while running/jogging, and it fits snugly on my head, making it perfect for exercising. The cord is quite long, so I usually wrap it around the iPod to make it fit better in my pockets.",positive
"For the price is a very good headphone. It is not a Bose, but is good for normal use. I like it.If you are willing to expend 200 or 300 dollars, buy Bose.",positive
"Cheap and light. This is a great budget headphone for your PC, especially if you start becoming annoyed by in-ear phones. Keep in mind there is no noise cancellation/noise direction, so don't think you're safe to watch porn on max volume.",positive
"I cannot say that these are top of the line headphones, but they weren't advertised that way.  They are inexpensive headphones that work, and do what I expected out of them.  I'm glad I purchased them.",neutral
I have been using these headphones for about a month and they have performed well so far.,positive
This is just what I was looking for - an inexpensive high-quality set of headphones.  It fits on top of your head (traditional - the way I like it) as opposed to behind your head.  Great sound quality.,positive
price was right for what I am using the headphones for. Using them at work for employees to listen to training videos. Good sound for the price,positive
They are lightweight and the sound is good. Since the actual ear pieces are convex and do not fit to the ear they can slide off a little too easily.,positive
"I've bought these repeatedly. The sound is great, and frankly I break headphones constantly (I enjoy mowing, working outside while listening to music). So the price and the quality are perfect.",positive
I still can't believe that I paid less than $5 for these quality Panasonic headphones. I didn't expect them to be so nice for the price. The sound quality is incredible. They are very durable and feel great on my head. I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I ordered a few more for the kids. I wish that everything this cheap was so well-made.,positive
I was looking for a pair of inexpensive headphones to wear while using my treadmill.  I typically replace them every year or so since the perspiration from my walking tends to cause the foam ear pieces to deteriorate.  This pair was within my budget and I opted to give it a try.  Very comfortable fit since the ear pieces swivel nicely about the head piece.  The sound quality is also excellent...bright treble and midrange and full bass. Great value.,positive
"These headphones are super-light weight and crystal clear.  They are exactly perfect for what I wanted, which is listening to myKindle Keyboard, Wi-Fi, 6"" E Ink Displayin the car.  By the way... y'all know you can listen to books on your kindle keyboard?",positive
"One problem I've had with a lot of headphones is the wiring from the audio jack connection to the ear pieces seems to come loose. Some headphones have been a little more durable than others. These seem about average in durability so far, and the sound quality is okay though nothing remarkable. If you're an audiophile, obviously you'd want to look at other options. But for the average listener who wants an inexpensive pair of headphones, these are okay.",neutral
"Scratchy, uneven sound. Plug does not fit snugly into a regulr 3.5mm jack.They are very lightweight and comfortable but uneven sound quality gives them3 stars.",neutral
"I gave these to my spouse primarily for the TV and so the audio doesn't really need to be top notch; I have no idea exactly how good these are in that respect.  He seems pleased with them but frankly, as they are a gift, he isn't likely to say anything bad.",positive
"As so many others have already said, these are really good headsets at really good price, so a GREAT VALUE.But no one's mentioned how nicely they self-adjust to your ears.  The ear 'pieces' tilt and twist a bit, so they go nicely right against your ears, which I'm sure helps them sound better.",positive
"First off, these are not $100 headphones; but the quality of sound is way better than I expected.  So much so, that I bought a 2nd pair as backup.  For under $10 I do not think you can do better.",positive
I was amazed at the quality of the sound from these inexpensive headphones. Even the bass is decent. They are also comfortable to wear.,positive
The headphones do the job. Now that I have a new laptop with louder sound I don't need them as much.,positive
"I cannot use earbuds because they won't stay in my ear, so I have to use headphones.  These fit snugly around my head and if I'm walking or running or even relaxing at home, I can hear my music and podcasts with good sound quality.  The plug fits iPhones or iPods or any standard entry port.  A great buy!",positive
I've owned a lot of cheap head phones for the computer and I love these. Great quality and built to last. I bought two more pair.,positive
these  head sets i bought for car use. for the price it works well. i do not worry about freq. children do not eather! they are better then some i paid moor for.,positive
Got these headphones due to all the great reviews and super price here at Amazon.I usually buy the phillips behind the head earphones but these bad boys are just as good if not better considering the AWESOME PRICE....Invest five bucks and check them out for yourself;you won't be dissappointed...,positive
"This is a great pair of headphones for cheap , good bass too . I use pretty expensive headphones in a studio enviornment but you cant use an expensive set for casual everyday use . For only a couple bucks these sound pretty full, are pretty solid and I dont care if they get lost or broken .",positive
Light and comfortable with reasonable fidelity. The only knock I have on these is the foam they used to cover the ear pieces. They seem to deteriorate a lot faster than than any thing else.,positive
"I didn't buy this product for me so I'm not the one that uses it, however it does what it needs to do and havent heard any complaints from the person that I bought it for.",positive
"I would not buy these again for my computer lab. They are easy to break, uncomfortable to wear, and just feel cheap. They were cheap, so I can't complain, but they just didn't hold up under the abuse of the students in my lab.",neutral
These are a great set of headphones for a great price!  These are used daily and are very durable (very important to us).,positive
Enough bass to make it sound fine! Just a little uncomfortable to wear but you will get used to it! Great sound for a few bucks!,positive
"Low cost headphones that sound good, fit well, and do everything they are supposed to do.  What else can you ask for?",positive
"I've been an audiophile for decades, and have had a varied collection of audio equipment, including headphones large and small. These lightweight phones provide some of the best, fullest sound that I have ever heard. They provide the illusion of being in a room with great speakers. I can't recommend these highly enough, especially for the price.",positive
Great sound for a great price. I didn't require much from these headphones. I'm mostly using them to listen to audio books and FM radio while I walk. It has a nice long cord (but not too long!) and is definitely more comfortable than the earbuds my CD player came with.,positive
"They work fine.  The sound is good. I find them more comfortable than ear plugs for long time use.  Of course they are bulkier than ear plugs. They are light weight and have very good sound.  The sound is not as good as the expensive ear-muff kind, but for what they are, they are good, IMHO.",positive
These headphones worked as well as or better than other headphones I have spent more money on. I wold highly recommend them.,positive
"I was looking for 'stereo' and hear you have it.  I was looking for comfort and a nice cord, has that, also.  What I miss was the controlling the volume, but that would have cost lost more.  The price and comfort make up for that.  Recommend.",positive
I don't have a lot to say here. There are no cons for this. the sound is great and the cable is long so that you're not getting jerked around when you're listening. I use these at my desk at work and I love them. I'd recommend these and I might buy another pair to have at home. There is no better buy for the price because I don't like in-ear earphones.,positive
"Ordered these from Amazon because I could no longer find them in local stores.  These headphones have great sound no matter what I'm listening to, and they're durable.  I stuff them into drawers, bags, under pillows, and they keep working.  One pair usually lasts me from twelve to eighteen months.  Really worth the money.",positive
"As it says in the title, they were to small and therefore uncomfortable for a man's size head.  They would probably be okay for a kid especially for the price.",negative
These Panasonic headphones are lightweight and sound great. Clear sound and no static at all. Very good price for these headphones too,positive
"I loved these headphones! I think it was a cheap price for such wonderful headphones that had an amazing sound. However, it got squished in one of my bags and broke.Seller: Lowest Prices & Best Services Corp.",positive
"Considering the price, the sound quality is excellent. I was impressed. The ear pads are a little hard but I can live with that.. Well worth the investment.",positive
They are very quiet. Even at the highest volume on my sons Leapster Explorer it is hard to hear what is going on through these. Definitely not worth the few dollars you spend on them.,negative
Perfect for the office. Comfortable and great sound. I use this with myLogitech Speakers z130 in the office. You won't be dissapointed if this is for basic use.,positive
look greatsound finegood bassso far still goingnow I need a pair that stay in my ears when working out....any suggestions not expensive thoughUPDATE: BROKEN,positive
I was really surprised at the sound that these headphones produce.  Very crisp and a good bass for the price.,positive
"Wow!  I actually had to throw these away.  The sound was fine, but I could not get comfortable when I wore them.  Maybe the plastic was deformed?  I don't know.  Maybe I just have a wierd head!  Ha. They would twist on my head and would not lay flat on my ears.  Anyway, I just flat out threw them out.  Couldn't wear them.  Sorry for bad review......but it's the truth!",negative
"For the price it is a great set of headphones, Perfect for light weight listening on a computer or music player",positive
I was pleasantly surprised when this item arrived. The headphones are light with excellent quality. I will be a good purchase for you.,positive
"I purchased these with a few other sets of headphones and these had the worst sound out of all of them.  So muffled! I had read through a ton of the reviews on these and I thought I had a winner, but NO.  Don't bother with these.  The mid tones and treble sound like there being played under water.  Bleh.",negative
"These are okay headphones. Not the best, obviously, but fine for light use. I use them mainly to listen to presentations on my computer. I don't notice any problems, hiss etc. So inexpensive you can't go wrong.I have brought a few pairs and they are consistent in performance. I need spares because my dog keeps getting then and chewing them up.",positive
"The sound is excellent, the price is great.  They are super comfortable too.  Love the right angle plug, works great.",positive
"I have several brands of headphones including the excellent denon ah-1001,$130.but for every day use on all your radios,computers and other devices for about $5.00.the panasonic rp-ht21 headphones are an excellent choice with excellent sound.You cant go wrong when ordering these from amizon,I have several of these and will probably order more in the future.",positive
got these. based solely on price and reviews. gotta say when i put them in the computer i was actually startled and very impressed with sound quality and bass.construction seems good. comfort is awesome and they fit great.no complaints at all.get them. can't beat the price and the quality is indeed there.,positive
Very good for the price. sounded better than other costly headphones i tried. wish the costly headphones work better. That's it.,positive
The sound is very good. It's lightweight but it delivers a very good sound with warm bass and clear treble. Very satisfied with it.,positive
I bought these to use with my kindle fire.  They work great. They are very lightweight and comfortable.I'm pleased with this purchase.,positive
love watching and listening to Youtub online the headphones early in the morning ... head phones make it possible while my wife sleeps.,positive
"I've previously paid a lot more for headphones that were no better than these.  I use them on my computer and my MP3 player while in my home only because I hate when sound leaks from my headphones in public and people can hear what I'm listening to, however, for around the house these headphones are great.",positive
"These headphones are uncomfortable for me.  If you are looking for an inexpensive pair of headphones, I find the Koss KPH/6 much more comfortable with similar sound.",neutral
My title pretty much says it all. If you want great thrilling sound spend more money but for me this works fine. They are lightweight and the sound surprised me. I am more than pleased.,positive
"These nice little headphones sound great, and if you lose them or sit on them, they're not expensive to replace",positive
"Husband is very pleased with these...and surprised.  Wasn't expecting these to be so good. Was exactly what he wanted for his need.  Inexpensive but so worth it. Lightweight, sound quality is very, very good.  He's a happy man!",positive
Good price for this headphone. Seems fragile. XBS port is new to me. Sony should explain it in the description what this port do to enhance this headphone. Of course one could google XBS port.,positive
"i was frankly shocked by these headphones- the sound quality is amazing, considering the price, and they're well-constructed and comfortable to wear. They just blow the white, ipod headphones out of the water- no comparison at all. The only con for me is that the sounds from the headphones leak out into the air, meaning these will probably be good in busy settings, but not so good in a library or office setting.",positive
I have had these for quite some time and they are still going strong! They have great sound and great bass for the little headphones that they are. Highly recommended.,positive
"Cheap earphones usually feature a dramatic drop in quality; these earphones are decent, though.  While they cannot quite compare to the more expensive ones, you certainly are getting a solid product for the price you're paying.I am satisfied by how the comfort level and sound quality featured by these headphones, in accordance to how much I paid.  I'll definitely buy another pair (or two) when I have the chance.",positive
Fits comfortably and blasts well. The bass sounds like street dance somewhere in the caribbean.....HEAVYYY!!!. Value for your money!!!,positive
"Easy to wear  for extended times, light weight and have great sound, I highly recommend, have had these in the past over 2 years, never a problem. These are getting very hard to find buy 2.",positive
"These headphones are cheap, but the only ones my husband likes when running. They stay on, have good sound, and last forever!",positive
The headphones are lightweight and have an excellent sound quality for what they are.  I watch videos and have used them without a problem.,positive
"I got these to make modified noise-canceling headphones with my Peltor 97069 earmuff (jsut break of the speaker ear pieces and place them inside the earmuffs).  They have pretty darn good sound quality, and everything about them is as you would expect - good cord length, decent enough quality, and they fit pretty well before I removed the headband.",positive
These are fantastic headphones. sound quality is awessome and the bass is great for succj an open air headphone.I just ordered 2 more to have on hand. usually when you fiind sosmething this good at this price it disappearsfor my iPod and iPad. I'vve been using Grado 60s but hard to wear at the gym. these will be perfecct,positive
"The best low cost headphones I can find.  The sound quality is decent, but it is not very mechanically rugged.  This is my second one as the first one broke at the sliding adjustment band after a few years of use while exercising.  But at this price I can afford to replace it every two years.",positive
"I use them with my laptop as I live with a day sleeper and watch shows at night so I don't disturbmy partners sleep.  The sound is great and I can still hear what is going on around me.  Good price,seems they are good quality and a long cord so I don't have to sit right next to the lap top.I highly recommend these.",positive
Good! Cheap! Easy to use! Perfect for kids to take to school and destroy each year! Will buy more for next year and the year after!,positive
"This product works well,I use it for my MP3 player and the sound is really good.I had had no problems so far and for the money,a very good buy.I like panasonic products and it makes sense to stick to name brand products.",positive
"For a set of under $5 headphones, these things ROCK!  Fitment is great, they're comfortable, they sound good, they're inexpensive, they have a long cord, and an adjustable headband.  What more could you want?  I plugged these into a set of portable headset mounted DVD players during a road trip with my kids and they were flawless the entire time (45 hours of driving).  Perfect for their purpose.  DVD players - check.  Headphones - check.  Sanity - check!",positive
"Okay, they're not top of the line headphones.  You can get better.  However, these are a pretty good value.  I bought a pair of them for use when I exercise.",positive
Very good headphones for the price. Use them all of the time and believe we have already got our money's worth.,positive
I returned this because the headphone jack didn't connect well with my samsung smart phone. I use the phone with several other sets of headphones and don't have this problem with any of them.  If I compare the plug with the other headphones that work I can't see a difference so I'm assuming that it's minor but enough to cause  a problem.,negative
"Sound seems ok, but the plastic loop is for a child's head, I think. They push on my ears pretty hard.",neutral
"Got these for my 15 year old to use on his laptop for whatever - music, school (he goes to online high school) - they work great.  He's happy with them, and for the price, I am too.He is not very careful with his things, so I wanted to find a cheap pair of headphones that would work decent and not be the end of the world if he wrecked them....BINGO!!  These are the ticket.",positive
They are what they say the are and do what they are intended to do no problems great price to have something inexpensive around to help block out other sounds.,positive
Love them so much I bought another set for my wife. The quality and construction far exceed my expectations considering the price. Sounds like I'm in a symphony hall.,positive
"Excellent product! Packs good lows and mids with pretty good bass. For the last 6 years, I was using Sony MDR710, excellent portable headphones. I ordered Sennheiser PX200 II recently but found it greatly lacked the bass! Returned it and ordered these seeing the great reviews. It's just a few notches down as compared to Sony MDR710/Sennheiser PX 200II. But has good bass as compared to PX 200, which cost ten times more!",positive
I got this for my 6 year old and since she is 6 she doesnt exactly take good care of things but so far they still work Very happy with them,positive
I wanted a set of cheap headphones for gaming when the wife's asleep.  These fit the bill.  Less than $5 from Amazon.  Don't expect great fidelity for so little money.  But I have ZERO complaints about these little headphones.  Satisfied.,positive
I only spent $5.35 for this pair of headphones and they work very well. Doesn't put out bass boosting sound but I can listen to my music well enough with these headphones. Haven't had any real major problems with it and it continues to work like the day I bought them.,positive
"5 stars because it is excellent quality for the price! Light enough to wear for long times and great sound ,",positive
I am not a fan of mp3 soundless sound. I am not a fan of most of today's sound. It lacks the depth and bottom end which makes the music for me. these headphones have an interesting range of sound including bottom end. I bought two pairs and plan on buying more. they are like the phones we used to get w/ portable cassette players - not all that sturdy but they are affordable and sound great.,positive
I've had these headphones for about a month now. The sound is great and I've had no problems so far.UPDATEI wrote this review in October and Its now July. My headphones stopped working properly in May So I'm now ordering a new pair. I got about a good 8 months out of these headphones which makes these the best pair I've ever had.,positive
"I like these headphones, the sound is excellent and they fit me. Thank you for this product.",positive
They work and they're cheap.  I didn't expect them to sound as good as they do and you just can't beat the price.  What more can you ask?,positive
"Based on the vast majority of reviews, I bought a couple sets of these headphones. I wasn't disappointed, these headphones are a tremendous value for the money. Rich and clear with wonderful bass. Worth at least double or triple the price.Update (7/12/2012) Still working great. Use them at least a couple (or more) hours every day.",positive
"These are super headphones for the money one  can't  go wrong with these baby's ,amazing where technology has taken us ...",positive
These headphones were low price and did the basic job OK....just didn't last long.  Something failed and I have no idea what.....just know they turned into junk quite early.,neutral
"I have always enjoyed SONY headphones, but these are a great value for the price.  They are not noise-cancelling, which I wanted, since I use them when walking about the city, so I desire to hear some street noise for safety's sake.  Yet the sound quality is superb, and the fit is comfortable.",positive
"I was skeptical because of the low, low price, but after reading all the reviews on Amazon I ordered these as a gift for my 88 yr old mother who needed some to watch tv late at night. They are sturdy and built well. The sound is excellent and highly recommended.",positive
"Just briefly:1) It is very comfortable and adjustable line over the head has little grip shape left and right which makes it easy to arrange the proper shape over the ears.2) Sound is decent clear with a good BASS3) The price is just affordable4) Just get it...P.S3.5 mm jack is angle shape, or to say ankle shape, like otherwise the straight 3.5 jack (most of iPod original headphones are straight 3.5 mm jacks)",positive
"Excellent sound for this price.  Not the best,  but I got it for $4.  including shipping.  This is really what Chinese headphones should sell for anyway,  but don't.  Remember,  even at this price they're still making profits or they wouldn't sell them.",positive
"Read an audio mag review and figured can't lose for a few bucks.  Wow!  It really sounds great for what it is.  No comparison to my Sennheizer HD-580, but for the price, UNBELIEVABL!  Better than most $20-30 headphones.  A true bargain even at 3x the price!!",positive
"This is a good product for the price offered. Although many people don't use these types of headphones anymore, I believe this is a good choice for use at home. I tend to have problems with the earbuds being too big or constantly falling out, but these headphones are good to go when you hood them on your head!",positive
Love these headphones. I bought them for commuting and they have a very nice sound quality (for the price) and they are comfortable. The cord is pretty long so I can keep my iPod in my backpack while listening to music. Very satisfied.,positive
"You know what you're getting into when you buy these. They get the job done and are really cheap, albeit a bit dorky-looking. I'd suggest a decent pair of earbuds over these, but they sound fine and keep outside noise where it belongs.",neutral
"Good, comfortable, basic headphones, but after using them for a month I would not recommend them for music. The audio quality is less than expected and does not have much range, especially bass.",neutral
These headphones are OK.  The sound is decent but I keep feeling like they're gonna fall off my head.  So not so good for running for me.  They do do fit into my iPhone and a generic MP3 player. I don't get the sense that they are really sturdy.  I'm gonna buy some over the ear phones as these on the ear earphones are just not working for me.,neutral
"For the price it is a find: Sounds OK -- When worn, does not hurt your head ofears. And is cheap enough not to cause undue anxiety if forgotten and lost at the gym.",positive
IT works and nice and quality of the sound is really goodBut there is no volume control. I would have a for an extra buck for that. :),positive
I agree these are the best headphones I've owned for little $$$. The jacks always seem to short out so I bought an extra pair.  After a year of abuse my original pair is still going strong. I gave the second pair away.........Love um!,positive
"I bought two sets about six months ago because they were cheap.  While the sound is good, the fit is terrible.  Both failed within four months--likely due to stress on the cords.  They also don't have a volume control and they are not good for television watching, if that's what you had in mind. I believe they are under warranty, but at this price, it's not worth the postage to send them to Sony.",negative
"Received the items promptly in the mail, tried them both out (memory and headphones) and everything worked great. Overall a positive experience. I would recommend Amazon to anyone looking to buy electronics.",positive
"I was not expecting much out of it but when you listen through it, you feel that you purchased some high end headphone. You won't be disappointed with it. Excellent bass and no distortion.",positive
This headphone rocks and you can't beat the price. If you constantly lose HP'Sgrab a set of these... you can't go wrong plus they sound great .Works great with my HD Zune.Will buy again for sure !,positive
"I love them.  I bought them to replace another pair of cheap, light-weight head phones that I use for nothing else except listening to my radio in bed, at night, when I'm wakeful.  They sound really good and the weight and shape of them makes them comfortable to wear.",positive
"Low price, decent sound and they last! Have had phone at 10X the price crap out due to a bad connector or something - so if you just need it for audio books or low-fi, this is the 100% best choice!",positive
I use these when I watch movies on my Kindle Fire HD so as not to disturb others.  They sound great for watching movies.,positive
I've had these earphones for more than a year now.  The quality of the sound is very good and they are tough enough to put up with less than perfect handling on my part.  I liked these so well I got a pair for my wife and she uses them frequently.  She's just as happy with her's as I am with mine.  Definitely recommend to others.,positive
These have about 60 to 65% the sound quality of my Sennheiser HD555 for about 5% the price. Of course I do miss the other 35 to 40% but for my Zune HD these work well at the gym where I would look silly with my HD555.,positive
"Wow!  I LOVE these headphones.  Had I known I would like them so well I would have gotten 2 more sets--I've tried expensive wireless noise-cancelling headphones (too much static), ear buds (hurts my ears), other brands of headphones (didn't last long)--and I've got to say  The cord is long enough for my needs.  The earpieces swivel but were not too  ""delicate"" for my use.  I'm tickled to find these headphones!",positive
i always had trouble with the ear-bud type so I was on the look-out for a reasonably priced pair of headphones.This one meets my needs completely; now i can watch my videos comfortably propped up in bed without disturbing my early-sleeper husband.,positive
"Very impressed with the quality stereo sound from an inexpensive headphone. Purchased it for my computer but would recommend it for any small audio equipment(IPOD, etc). Comfortable, adjustable fit. For music lovers; excellent high end and bass is decent. Highly recommend.",positive
"The Panasonic headphones for $4.47 are a true bargain.They work fine and are inexpensive to replace.I have used $100.+ headphones, only to have them stop working.First the volume control then the drivers. I replaced threecords, each costing more than one of the Panasonic RP-HT21's.",positive
Good for speech or other non music uses. Plastc headband not very comfortable for extended use. Low price makes this headset disposable and worth buying. Probably good for kids uses.,neutral
I needed a lightweight set of headphones for computer gaming (as not to annoy the neighbors) and also a set to do guitar over-dubbing on my 4 track recorder. These have an amazing depth of solid sound to them for the budget price and are comfortable to have on. I've shared these as gifts -- and am I going to get another pair for my other audio devices? I just did. Highly recommended.,positive
I wanted to buy inexpensive headphones that worked fairly well and I would not be upset if they got lost or broken. These fit that objective perfectly. They work very well listening to Pandora on my Kindle Fire. They are lightweight and comfortable and about a hundred times better than the throw away types you get on the plane.The only problem now is I will be very disappointed if they get lost or broken!,positive
"For the price these headphones are a nice purchase. I tried them on several products...different mp3 players, laptop computer, desktop computer, and even my GPS unit. The sound was very good in each instance and responsive to equalization changes made on my mp3 players. Decent bass response with clear tones otherwise. I recommend these headphones highly for good sound and over-the-ear comfort.",positive
For an inexpensive headset they have a great sound. I use them on a little Walkman radio and the sound is great.  I've not had many headsets so I'm not an expert but I like the sound that comes from this unit.,positive
Five bucks...lolThese have super sound for that price.For five bucks you won't find anything better.5 stars for this great pair of headphones.Update - Sept 18 2013I am actually using these over my expensive Philips noise cancelling headphones.These have better sound.Super buy.,positive
"For the price, you really can't beat these headphones.  They sound very good for the price, and are comfortable and easily portable.  I bought a couple pairs to have at work and home.  Great product.",positive
"I bought this for my teen age son, always loosing or braking his head phones.  I bought 2 of these to have one for a spare, so far the second one is still in the box, and my son loves it.  I notices the sound level was a little lower than my nice Sony ear buds.  But so far that are working good.",positive
"I am an insomniac. When i go to bed i start thinking, and this keeps me awake.I have a set of Old Time Radio shows and a DVD player. I run these shows all nite and listening to the shows, 'short circuit' my thinking.Since i am a side-sleeper and a roller, the small, flat shape of the phones makes them more comfortable than any bulkier phones would.",positive
"Sound is not that good, they are unconfortable, actually ugly. They were cheap, not much was lost... will keep them near the computer, but not for long term use.",negative
"The product has arrived as expected, and appears to be as described: lightweight, good sound, XBS. You can add that the price is very low for Panasonic. Its smallest size fits my 4-year-old boy. No hassle whatsoever.Seller was very prompt, and delivery was fast.",positive
"Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphone are very good.I have more than one set.Price,was more than good and sound quality is outstanding for what I use them for.Again, a good buy.",positive
"This is a basic headphone but it works fine for what I bought it for, short-term use.  Its price is great, so it's a good value and it works.",positive
"OK...I read the reviews and thought, ""Just how good can $4.50 headphones be? These reviewers are getting a little carried away...""But I needed cheap disposable 'phones for work. So, what the heck. I bought them.I was wrong. these headphones are awesome! They sound better than my expensive headphones I use at home.Run...do not walk...and buy a pair. Heck, I am buying everyone these 'phones as stocking stuffers for Christmas.Fantastic product.",positive
"The quality of sound is acceptable, considering the low price.  However, the headpiece that connects the two ear pieces does not adjust to a small enough size for me -- and I'm not a small headed person.  Consequently it tends to slip off at the gym.  If you wear a hat or have a lot of hair, they will likely fit you fine.",neutral
"i have about 50 pairs of headphones from philips to koss to seinheiser to sony and these panasonic. they are the cheapest pairs of headphones i got by far yet i found myself going back to these for 2 simple reasons. they sound great and they are comfortable. and finally for this price, you would not expect this set to last but it does last a long time (2-3 years).",positive
Absolutely terrific headphones.  They take a licking and keep on ticking.  Why pay 100+ dollars for headphones when these deliver terrific sound for a fraction of the cost?,positive
"It's hard to find a pair of headphones like these now days, I refuse to jam something down into my ear (reduces situational awareness, jams ear wax farther down into your ear etc). These have now faithfully served me well for almost 2 years at work and are only now starting to develop a little crackle due to the wire getting a short developing, still qutie usable though. Would buy again.",positive
"Can't beat the price.  These are nice, lightweight headphones with good sound quality.  I'm very impressed and would recommend these for anyone.",positive
"Yes, these are absolutely greatest bang for the buck.  Beats the little in ear phones that came with my iphone.  I love the extra long cord too.  Sound quality is surprisingly great.",positive
"The Panasonic Lightweight Headphones just arrived and I have used them for a short time, but it appears they will work just fine. Arrive as stated and well packaged.",positive
The headphones arrived safely and promptly.  They are a nice set of small earphones with a good head size adjustment mechanism and the sound is equal on both sides.,positive
I use these with my Roku 2 remote for late night tv watching. for the price you cant go wrong.,positive
"I bought 3 sets of these for my kids to watch videos on a trip.  They're much too large for a child's head, the volume is too low (I didn't mind this for my kids), the sound quality at it's best is still poor, and there is horrible static every time the plug moves in the headphone jack.  They're cheap, but I wouldn't bother with these even if they were free.",negative
Not sure why so many 5 star reviews. They work okay. For the price I'd buy them again ($3) no question. They are cheap headphones that you'd expect to get with an old Walkman or hand held CD player.,positive
"I paid $4.96. I just wanted something lighter to wear while doing chores, & thought at this price I'd get these headphones & not worry about less sound quality. BUT...I was floored by how good they sound. No, they're not going to sound like an expensive pair of headphones, but good gosh, for under five bucks they're amazing.",positive
I didn't want to shell out much money for classroom headphones. These fit the kids well and sound good. I'll be buying some more for home and the classroom.,positive
"Great sound quality, comfortable, pretty rugged; these survive catching the cable on things, being dropped, etc.  I break a pair every year or so and just keep a spare on hand.  These work just as well for me as $50 headphones.These work great with my iPod.  Won't work with an iPhone (or other cell phone), which uses a different connector (4 connections instead of 3) to support a microphone.",positive
"The subject says it all. Headphones are light, nice and fit well on my head. I have no complaints.",positive
"I really liked these (sadly, they broke a while ago--my fault). Great for the price. Comfortable. You can hear EVERYTHING, it's amazing.",positive
"Don't let the size and weight fool you, these are very good headphones for the price. My kids are always breaking headphones and this is a great way to provide them with quality sound at a good price.",positive
"I bought 2 of these headphones. I also bought a splitter with seperate volume control ( see review)  Ithese are lightweight and fit in my laptop, pandigitasl novel. and its panasonic !!",positive
"I run the IT Division of a small non-profit. I purchased these for staff that needed to watch webinars or online training. They work well and are not so high-end that they disappear. I find that staff doesn't hesitate to return them back to us when they are complete. If you just need some sound in the ears and you don't care about the aesthetics of it, these are a great option.",positive
"I bought these headphones or my kids and after seeing a cnet review citing these as a great bang for your buck headphones.  For just under five bucks, I agree.  Five stars for overall bargain, not because ther are better than bose or skull candy's.",positive
"For the price, this cannot be beaten.  I bought the new Logitech UE 6000 headphones but ended up putting it away due to ear sweating issue.  I use this headphones daily.",positive
"Using this with my Ipod and it works great.  I do a lot of photography, especially nature, and it's great to be able to put on the headphones and listen to music while I work.",positive
"Since I am not an audio foamer the balance of quality and cost, especially, cost these are a no brainer for me.",positive
"I like the over the head earphones, since I like to lay in bed and read my Kindle and it's comfortable for me.  The Panasonic has very good sound, is lightweight and pretty easy to wear.  The cable is long, which works for me since I just don't like the earbud sets that have a very short cord length. For the money, this is a good product that is well made and sturdy.",positive
These are the best headphones that I have ever owned and they were only $5! I don't like in the ear type as they never stay in the ear. These are even light and comfortable. You hardly notice them. Great deal!,positive
I was looking for some inexpensive head phones. My ears are too small and standard buds etc just don't fit my ears well. These are very affordable head phones. Good quality. I would order more from this seller. Arrived in a timely manner.,positive
"These headphones work fine. Again, they're used by our grandkids when they come to play games on my computer-- and I don't have to worry about it if I have to replace a pair, the price point is so good.",positive
"For the price these are great, have an acceptable sound quality.  Especially good for kids.  I bought a pair months ago and they still work perfect and the kids are really rough with them.",positive
"I hate those earphones that go into your ear, very uncomfortable.  I like to listen to my mp3 player while I cut my grass and I can put these headphones on under my hearing protection and I don't have to worry about the earphone dropping out of my ear like the others would do.  It was very annoying.  They are lightweight and they sound good.",positive
"After a few years one of the speakers has gone out.  But hey, it was only 6 bucks.  Has lots of bass.",neutral
This a decent headset for the price.  It is somewhat comfortable and appears to be durable.  I bought 2 just in case.,positive
"I have switched from ear buds to these. I tried another, larger pair of headphones but much prefer these. Sound is great and when it's windy (often here) the wind noise does not detract. Highly recommended.",positive
Great headphones for the price!  Can't beat the low cost.  They work just fine.  I recommend these for budget buyers.,positive
I have experience with these from an old CD player that used them. Ordered six pair for a church assisted listening system and they are startlingly clear with great bass response. AND you can hear everything going on around you while listening too. The don't isolate the listener from the rest of the world. I couldn't be happier.,positive
"This is not beats, but if you want a very low price Panasonic, I recommend it.[These are the more required words!]",positive
"until now it is very good headphone, for the price and sound quality, this is the first time i buy one with this price and get like this sound",positive
Nice product. It is working very well from past 1 year. Exceeds the expectation. Sound quality is very gud. Full satisfaction,positive
"These work good for the low price, and the easy over head use, but sadly my head is way smaller than what these are intended for, wouldn't work for children then either.  They're adjustable, but even on the smallest setting theres a huge gap leaving it not snug and easy to move around with them on :/",negative
"Most headphones do not adjust and are uncomfortable for me to wear, but these are snug, but not too tight. I thought at first that one side wasn't working on the ""stereo headphone"", but I just didn't have it plugged into the jack all the way. Very nice; I'd buy again.",positive
Good headphones and a really good price. The sound quality is hard to beat and the headphones are very light. Nice product from Panasonic.,positive
"Junk. These things lasted no time with my girls mp3 player. All she did was ride her bike and listen to them but the wires are so thin they constantly were shorting out. I would find the short, fold it up and tape it in position to work for her but after a couple fixes I just bought her some better ones. She likes the new ones. They didn't come from Amazon.",negative
"I wanted these for the kids to use when playing the Xbox360.  They work great.  They are lightweight, have very good sound quality and are inexpensive.  It's a great value item!",positive
These sound decently good for the price! Don't expect these to sound like a pair of good Sennheisers or Kiplisch sets.,positive
I needed headphones for listening to my PC or mp3 and didn't want to spend a lot.  I could not believe how great these sounded.  Great bass and very comfortable.,positive
Got two pairs of these as cheap ones i dont care if break or get lost. better sound then buds and can put a little bass. A little. But more then buds will. Worth having as spares.,neutral
excellent product and i seeno need for further  eloquence  on this matter at this time and thats all folks amen,positive
these were Christmas gifts for my daughters 6 and 8. i have little experience with these they worked when i got them and you cannot beat the price.,neutral
Amazing headphone I wear these overnight they are really loud I mean headache loud if you put them up to their loudest or somewhat there loudest constantly for a while you will getta it's comfortable too,positive
These are really a nice headset.  They fit snug to the head and the sound is good.  Since they are difficult to find I will be ordering another pair as a backup.,positive
"I had been using ear buds with my Kindle, but they were so uncomfortable.  These headphones are comfortable, they adjust easily, and the sound quality for watching movies and listening to music is very good.  I do not treat them with tender loving care, and even with my abuse they are holding up better than any of the ear buds that I previously purchased.  You can&#8217;t beat the price!",positive
beats the earpieces in your ear by a mile--i use it while walking--so i am not too voncerned about ll the features--it LETS ME HEAR MY MUSIC,positive
"They work, but the construction suggests that they'll fall apart in a few months.  They're sitting on a shelf in my closet, because they aren't big enough to comfortably fit.",neutral
"I like the sound I get from these headphones. I just don't like how they squeeze my head while the speakers turn toward the back of my head. I want them to fit on my ears, not turn outward toward the back of my head. The back of my head isn't listening to the music, my ears are!! I'll have to look into modding these a bit. Good sound, bad design, NOT comfortable.",neutral
"Be aware that the cord is not very long ( about 54"") ...you may well need an extension cord to use them in many situations.",positive
"THESE HEADPHONES GAVE ME GREAT SOUND, GREAT FIT, GREAT PRICE.  WHAT MORE CAN I SAY?",positive
They are too light and don't really hold well on your ears but they are decent for the price and has a longer cable them most,neutral
"For the price, they're stupid good!Nice balance, light and unassuming, surprisingly decent sound, balance and bass.No noise canceling, but I wouldn't expect any from this size, price and design.Well worth it!",positive
"can't have super-high expectations given the price, but they're not as comfortable as i'd hoped (or as other cheap sets have been).  still, they work and sound fine.",neutral
"The Panasonic RP-HT21 doesn't break easy, thus, my reason for buying them again.  Great sound too!  I would buy again.",positive
"I bought this because it was a cheap add on for my free shipping. It was the best decision of my life (so far). The headphones still work despite the many times I dropped them. They are lightweight as the name states. Also, they don't squeeze my ears like most headphones do. These earphones are very gentle on my ears. They are very light, so the top of my head does not hurt from long hours of usage.",positive
"My kids just wanted light, comfortable headphones when listening to music on computers.  Sound fidelity, noise cancelling, etc, did not matter to them.  Kinivo bluetooth headphones were expensive but uncomfortable behind the head and they did not want the trouble of having to charge the battery.  These headphones are cheap, light, long cord, and pretty good sound as well.",positive
"I just wanted a decent &#34;beater&#34; set, but these are really good. They don't seem to fit me all that well, but aren't uncomfortable. And did I say they sound good? Well, they do.",positive
"Hi. If I buy that will make mistake. Because I will not be able to hear the loud enough. I rather have the LOUD headphone, because I'm deaf. I always use the headphone since I was 13 years old. Do you have the LOUD headphone? Thank you very much. Have a great week. Vicki",negative
Nice headphones for the price.  I wanted something that I could carry around and not worry about a great loss if I accidentally broke or misplaced them.,positive
"I bought this more than six months ago. I only like traditional headphone. It is used five days in a week for more than 40 minutes during workout. It sometimes get wet with sweat. It works like charm. No issue with loose connection to speaker or pin.I would highly recommend and buy some more as spare. I have tried many others like Coby, Sony but this turned out to be best and cost effective traditional headphone.",positive
Pros:CheapExcellent voice quality and build quality.Good fit for ear and head.Cons:Two wire chords for each side.No extra cushion pad.On full volume sound leaks and nearby people can hear.Overall value buy for five bucks.,positive
"According to my grandson, these are great headphones.  He especially like that they are lightweight.  I love them, because I don't have to listen to the music that accompany his games.  Arrived in a timely manner and in new retail packaging.",positive
"To be brief, I have owned my set of Panasonic RP-HT21 headphones for nearly a year and I have used them quite a lot, and I can attest to their excellent sounds, durability, and comfort. For less than $5.00 they are a terrific bargain and I would recommend them to anyone without reservation!Two thumbs, way, way up!",positive
These sounded just fine for cheap headphones. They are pretty comfortable as well. If you need something cheap to take on a plane or somewhere where you don't care if you lose them then these are the headphones to get.,positive
"Great product for the affordable price. I was impressed with the sound quality. The bass, midrange is awesome. I like this headphone for the price and I will buy more next time I shop at amazon. I will recommended this to my friends.",positive
"These are a great price for the purposes I need - just to silence the speakers during other family members sleep time or when they are watching TV.Comfortable to wear, lighweight, easy on the ears, descent sound, long cords.No negatives so far.",positive
"These are a great ,not to big or to small, the only down side is I used them only a couple times and found that I had static in my ears when I moved around.",neutral
"As others have noted these are a great bargain. Also quite thin profile, comfortable to wear even against a pillow, etc.",positive
"Frankly, I haven't used them very much.  I bought them to replace some very bad headphones that came with my portable DVD player and they work very well for that purpose.",positive
THEY WERE JUST AS DESCRIBED AND VERY REASONABLY PRICED  THEY PERFORMED WELL FOR THE COST AND I USE THEM EVERY DAY!!!!!!,positive
Broke like all the rest of my headphones break. I must have bought ten types of headphones. They all break inside the wiring somewhere.,neutral
My husband and I use these all the time on our iPads and we are satisfied even though they are a little large for my head.,positive
"Much better than my last pair, and cheaper. They're a bit tight, and thus sort of give me a headache, but hopefully I wear them in. Really wonderful sound. Didn't realize what I was missing with my last pair.",positive
I really love this earphones... it has just a little bit of a bass that gives it a notch above my laptop.  Highly recommend for the cheap price.,positive
these are okay.  they fit around my head nicely.  they don't really project a quality sound at all.  lows of muffely lows and blury,negative
I prefer that my kids use these instead of ear buds when listening to music. The sound is very good and they are more comfortable.,positive
I've used this on both my pc and on the radio when walking the dogs.  Good quality construction and reasonably price. Think I'll get another one.,positive
I am quite pleased with my new Bushnell Falcon 7x35 binoculars. They are very light and very easy to use. I am upgrading from a compact 10x25 set. I use them mostly for birdwatching. I recommend this set to anyone interested in birding.,positive
"The binoculars are well made.  They are very easy to focus, and good for viewing animals, sports events,  and scenery.  I would recommend them to someone who needs a basic pair.",positive
"We bought these for our rental property and they work fine for that purpose.  If I bought another pair, I'd go for a bit stronger.",positive
I read several reviews for different binoculars on Amazon before buying these for my husband for Christmas.  He wanted to be able to see all of our backyard from the house.  We have a Koi pond and birdfeeders so attract a lot of wildlife.  He is really enjoying these.  No complaints about construction.  He and I recommend for general purposes.,positive
"These are wonderful. They are easy to use and allow for precise viewing of objects. They feel and look like they are high quality - there is a nice, but not burdensome, heft to these. I know my father will enjoy them for years to come - great Christmas gift!",positive
"other reviews I read were encouraging.  additional research led me to this item.  as it turned out this is the perfect magnifing agent to view anything within the immediate vicinity.  we used it on our vacation in the Galvaston, TX area.  it brought subjects clearly up close.  very handy item to have.",positive
"I bought these to take camping and hiking with me. They are big but that was my mistake. The lenses focus very well and it helps me see animals that are farther away. I felt like I was able to get within feet of elk, moose, big horn sheep, and bears. I'd buy another smaller pair to take with me hiking from the same company.",positive
I bought these for a cruise to Alaska for sightseeing and they are very easy to use! I was able to go whale watching and see a lot of glaciers with these binoculars.The case with adjustable strap helped a lot too because I was trying to hold the camera at the same time when I was sightseeing.,positive
Hey you can spend a little and get crappy binoculars of spend a fortune and get very nice binoculars. For the price these are really a bargain and very nice overall. I love them for a price paid and have zero complaints about them... I bought 3 pair and they are all perform just fine.,positive
"I wanted these because my dad had a similar pair in the 1950s-60s, although this is an updated version.  Center focus lever works good,  They're fairly heavy compared to little pocket binocs, but the image is a lot brighter, so you can see more detail.  The 7x power is good, less vibration effect compared to 8x and 10x.This factory-refurbished product is a great deal for the money.  Recommended.",positive
I got these for my wife and I to watch neighborhood birds.  We get a kick out of watching them.  These things really are nice.  Now we see them up close.  Easy to focus and adjust for different people.  Good value.,positive
These are a great quality. They have a good case that comes with it and protectors for the lenses. It fits on your face very well and the focus is very easy to use with just one finger,positive
"Never owned a good pair of binoculars so I thought I would pick these up, the price was in my range, and I love the value for what I payed. I could see down the street in my area and the moon is much more visible then before. Highly recommended !!!",positive
What I really liked about this was the quick focus....when whales are breaching out of the water..you need to focus fast. These do!,positive
We bought these binoculars for our trip to Gettysburg this summer and I know that we will greatly enjoy using them!  They seem to be just what we needed!,positive
I recently broke my 7 X 35 binoculars while whale watching in Hawaii.  These are an excellent and equivalent for a good price.,positive
"I wear progressive bifocals and that might be the issue here. I cannot focus these well enough to see the birds in my yard really close from 30 to 40 feet away. My son, however, does like them and he doesn't wear glasses. I do better with my 70-300 zoom lens on my camera, albeit it's heavy. And it's auto focus.",neutral
Took them to Joshua Tree and they were awesome. Worth every penny. I definetly recommend them to any outdoorsey person.,positive
"These are well priced and work fine. Got them for a gift for a bird watching friend. She says, they are light and are easy to adjust.",positive
"If you're looking for a digital stabilizer zoom in binocs, better save some more.  These are your basic binocs at a decent price and they work well. Very good product for the buck.",positive
"The magnification is appropriate for the size of the aperture.  Picture is clear, sharp, and stable.  Lets lots of light in, and the weight of the binoculars helps you hold it steady.  I like the one touch focus much easier to use than dials.  Highly recommended for the price.",positive
"Great sharpness,very clear,can't beat the focus.better product when I was a growing up.nice price I can deal with weight.not a bad trade off carry case soft.still worth it.old sschool",positive
"This pair of glasses could readily spot the creatures that I was interested with and it was easy to teach the young 'uns how to use them. The images were fine for an amateur birdwatcher, well defined and free of distortion.",positive
"I purchased these based on the reviews.  I sometimes sit in my backyard and watch air planes, birds, squirrels... and the view on these binoculars are remarkable.",positive
"Extremely lame, though marginally effective. I wish I had researched more and got something better instead. Live and learn. Yup.",negative
"Wanted a well built, easy to use set of Binoculars to leave at Jimbos Farm NC for guests to use.These are just what I wanted.  easy to use,  solid construction, and useful case.  Can't beat them for the price.Now we can watch the White Tailed Hawk in her nest next to pond.  We hear her up there but never seen nest up close.",positive
I wanted a set of cheap binoculars that work. These do work fine but they do not zoom long distances. Perfect for items around the house. I am not sure they would work at a ball game depending how far back you are.,positive
Bushnell is the premier maker of Binoculars.  In this case these were advertised as having auto focusing - which are actually manual.  In the end they were light weight and magnified as expected.,neutral
It works like how binoculars should work.  It's lets you see far and clear and has a good grip to it.,positive
"It does work for the purpose I got it, but then when I use the lens cover to prevent them from getting scratched, it keeps coming off loose. Not sure if I will come back to this product. Thought, Bushnell was a quality product producing company, hmm?",neutral
came quickly. right weight. clear view. this is my second pair. my neighbor wanted a pair just like mine so I ordered him a pair.  Great to watch wild life which is what we do. Thrilling to see baby deers playing in the meadow.,positive
"The quality, the price, I just don't know where to start. They are by far the best 7x35 I've owned. I'm not going to go on and on. If your looking for a middle of the road, quality, great price, 7x35 than your at the right place. I would highly recommend these. Enough said.",positive
"We will be cruising to Alaska and these binoculars feel easy to use and it come with a case and straps. I bought it after reading all the positive reviews. After our trip, I will update upon its real use.",positive
"I got one pair for my wife and one for me.  They were such a great deal, I figured we should both have one.  We have them on hooks right by the front door.  That way, anytime we see a bird out the window, we can grab the binocs and check it out.  We've also brought them on a couple outings.  They are easy to carry around and are of excellent quality!",positive
"For the money you can't beat them. A good &#34;BIRDING&#34; Binocular, I use the for &#34;BOATING&#34;, they don't take up a lot of room like larger 7 x 50 binoculars do, at 7 x 35 they have the same view as 7 x 50 (you won't be able to tell the DIF bet. 35 and 50 Fld of view). If they go overboard, it's NOT a big loss. excellent gift for a &#34;BOATER&#34; !",positive
"I bought this for my wife so that she can whale watch. I also bought her a larger one, but it's much harder to hold steady. It's one is great for whale watching from the shore. Great price too, can't go wrong!",positive
"work great for out at the shooting range for spotters to see targets. Super easy to adjust focus. Doesn't require turning a knob, has a lever you can push down either way to adjust",positive
"When I first received these glasses, I was happy... lite and perfect... but, they never aligned properly... I had one image slightly higher and one slightly slower than the other... I have to give full credit to Amazon... they immediately gave me a credit and I purchased the Barska Gladiators which I love... and they showed up the next day!!!!!",negative
"These are great binoculars at a great price. I really like the rocker vs the knob for focus adjust. I would reccomend these binoculars to anyone who needs a pair for everyday use, but the reasonable price makes them a great buy for the casual user also.",positive
I use it for bird photography when I need to spot birds. Clear and easy to focus better than spinning a ring. This feature is important because a difficult focussing system is not useful in bird photography. It is also light and does not slip in your hands.  More power makes difficult to spot small birds.,positive
"Great binoculars and can see long distances very well with them, sturdy and well built. Also like the fact it comes with a carrying case, microfiber cloth, and caps for each lens. Very happy with this purchase!",positive
"The reason I purchased these binoculars is because I am a hummingbird d&eacute;vote and I like to see what birds are using my feeders.  I have to be about 12' from the Hummingbirds so as to not disturb them and, being as small as they are, these binoculars have worked out just right.",positive
THIS BUSHNELL 7X35 BINOCULAR WILL BE PUT TO GOOD USE ON OUR VACATION TO BEAUTIFUL ALASKA STATE.I AM SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASED AT AMAZON AND I PREVIOULY OWNED A BUSHNELL WIDE ANGLE 7X35 BINOCULAR I HAVE GIVEN TO MY NEPHEW IN THE PHILIPPINES STILL IN USE.,positive
"These binoculars work great. When I couldn't get out in the country often, I used these to get a closer look at the racoons in the trees out back.",positive
"I bought these for a safari trip to Tanzania. They performed very well, we're easy to focus with the large central focus swivel and are lightweight, which is important when hanging around your nrck (along with a camera) all day. For the price I am very satisfied.",positive
"I bought these binoculars based on the reviews on amazon.  I am uninformed about optics or the comparative merits of other brands and sizes of binoculars.  I use this pair to see across a lake, about 2000-3000 feet and I can see the individual leaves on the trees.  The binoculars are easy to adjust and a very nice toy.  Sturdy enough that I let my 8 yr old play with them under supervision.",positive
"WHILE THIS CAMERA TAKES DECENT PICS, THE BATTERY LIFE IS INEXCUSABLE. MY DURACELL LASTED 3 DAYS. THE ICONS, BUTTONS AND MENUS DO NOT COME NATURALLY. LEAVE IT TO CANON TO MAKE YOU BUY THE ESSENTIAL RECHARGABLE BATTERY SEPARATELY. FROM NOW ON I STAY WITH SONY. EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE AND THE BATTERY LASTS FOREVER.",neutral
"This is an excellent little digital camera that is both rich in features and high in megapixel resolution--compared to the competition.  My only complaint is that you have to remove the battery when the camera is not being used, otherwise the camera will eventually drain it.  Considering the features, this is only a minor  complaint.",positive
"The Canon S20 is simply stellar.  It takes outstanding photos, yet is very easy to use.  Of equal importance, it is tiny, so you'll never have to leave it behind!  You simply can't go wrong with this handy, high-end digicam.",positive
"Sometimes when I take a shot, and get it to my PC I look at it and wonder, how such a samll unit can crete such clean pictures.For most  applications the S10 will do but the S20 is good value still.",positive
"The only problems are poor screen outdors, and no removable battery (Which in only on the new 560 series) anyway is rugged and well finished. And includes good software. I like it a lot.",positive
"Better Hand Writing recognition ! MP3 ! Better integration w/MS Applications (no surprise) Word, Excel ! Better NOTES I use it all the time, while the Palm sat.Needs a faster CPU, a little slow You really  need a CompactFlash if you want to listen to lots of MP3 (I have a 96meg).  Need a way to close applications when your done. Overall a GREAT Device And  I DO NOT work for MS of HP",positive
"Mom asked for educational games. This one is a little advanced for them she said the occasionally have  hard time figuring out the math but they still play and get the answe with help form Mum and Dad. They will grow into it fully in a few months, Mom says.",positive
I really like this game more than I thought I would.  It is a great learning game utilizing addition and subtraction.  The characters that move around the board are very cute.  I love educational games especially when your child has fun while learning.,positive
All the kids I have bought this for are around 4-6 years old and they all learn so much and have fun playing it.,positive
Who would have ever thought that adding and subtracting would be a fun game?? We got this after reading the reviews and my 5 year old daughter loves it. Somehow she always seems to beat me in the game.,positive
"Make sure your little one can already add and subtract to play this game.  It's cute but it does come with dice and small pieces...if you have a baby around, keep him/her away as the pieces will pose a choke hazard.  Other than that, enjoy playing with your 4 or 5 or 6 year old or whatever you have who can add and subtract...this is a cute educational game...recommended....",positive
Other reviews weren't lying; this game works!  My daughter had no interest in math and I've watched her interest and math skills jump the past few weeks as she's played.  She has gone from counting by fingers (each one every time) to only some of them to no fingers at all.  This is really a miracle for her!  She is four--will be five next week--and it has been a great game for us!,positive
I teach kindergarten and this will be PERFECT for our math lab game table.  We are learning addition right now and this is the perfect game for the game table.  They are so tired of roll and record games and dominoes that this will be a nice change.  Good quality and easy rules.,positive
"I purchased this game for my 5 year old, he is in kindergarten and loves math. I believe this game would only be useful for grades K-1(age4-6). The character pieces are: Green-snail, red-frog, blue-snake, and yellow turtle. The game reinforces addition and subtraction; odd and even numbers; and creating number sentences by having the child recognize which number is bigger to create a number sentence.",positive
We were looking for something to reinforce addition and subtraction.  This game is a great tool.  It only goes up to 6 on each dice so you can only go as far as 12 but still has really helped.  It is cute with 4 reptiles as token to move and has a couple of neat ways to play with shortcuts.  We like this purchase.  Just what we needed.,positive
Our 4 year old daughter loves this game. I love it when she likes something that is teaching her.  Great buy!,positive
"my only regret is i should have bought the ice model rather than the blue...sadly after only a few years of service, this gadget packed up. lost all my data. very annoying. decided not to replace it, too.",positive
"This is the absolute best gadget you will ever buy!  It does everything  from organizing your life, to downloading web pages, to replacing your TV /  VCR remote.This is a definate must for the gadget enthusiast!  I am VERY  happy with this PDA; an excellant value that is both economical and fits in  your pocket!",positive
The device is perfect. It is what all Palm Pilot devices aspired to become. I am still looking for the remainders of the family of devices and accessories.,positive
"I take my Visor everywhere with me.  I can never remember a phone number, but now I dont have to.  I link it up with my Outlook calendar, and I never miss an appointment.  The only thing lacking here is a color screen, but try finding one anywhere near this price:  It cant be done!",positive
"Well...at just over a [price]I don't think you could do better.  I wanted to get a ""Pocket PC"" but I have found that this Visor takes care of everything I need.  Unless you need a color screen for games or you need pocket office...this unit should meet your needs.  Sync's great with Outlook.",positive
"The price, features, and expandability via Springboard modules make this an excellent PDA!  I'm very happy with it and highly recommend it.",positive
"I've had both the Palm III and the Visor Deluxe.  The Visor is EVERYTHING  the Palm III is, but with a promising expansion slot for a GPS, modem,  radio, mp3 player, pager, ethernet, ..., ..., ...",positive
"very helpful.  When you're on the road and have to hard reset (happened to me), this is a life saver.",positive
"The Handspring Backup Springboard Module is a quick and easy way to keep your Visor's data safe. The module accommmodates all the data on a Visor Deluxe, and its simple one-step backup and restore processes are virtually  fool-proof.This module provides a second form of backup for users who  synchronize their Visor handhelds to a PC or a Mac. For users who don't  sync to a PC or Mac, this module is a must-have to keep your data safe.",positive
"Extremely simple to use. Once taken out of the box, snap on, and you're ready to do your first backup with a press of a onscreen button.My visor crashed several times and I had to do a hard reset (loosing all data and software installed). But with this springboard, you can restore everything back with a click of &quot;Restore&quot; button.",positive
I use my with my Hand Spring Palm Pilot. It works OK but the photo quality is only fair. I only purchased it to expand my Handspring visors capabilities,neutral
This was a quirky unit that required more effort to use than one would expect. More of a Science Project than an appliance. Low resolution.,neutral
My bike light went out and I replaced the Toshiba batteries with these. The light didn't work. These are weak batteries and for bike lights don't use them.,negative
"These batteries last a very long time compared to other brands, and they are very reasonably priced. I have a difficult time finding N batteries, so I am thankful Amazon sells them here. I would recommend highly!",positive
I don't believe that these batteries are fresh. They seem to arrive already weak from age drain or some other issue. For the price they are not even as good as the readily-avilable AA's.,negative
"Used these in a calculator for more than four years, and just replaced them - with same brand, of course....",positive
"I purchased this battery to replace a defective one for an old Triplett 310 voltmeter. The battery could have been purchased locally, but I needed to purchase a 15 volt battery also and ordered them both at the same time. This was an easy decision as the N battery was much cheaper on line.",positive
"Great batteries, they work pretty well. Quick shipping and great price for two batteries.I'll buy more of those batteries.",positive
For all you tiny battery fans out there this is the product you've been waiting for.  Just don't drop it because it will roll off somewhere and you'll never find it again.,neutral
"These N batteries are used in several smaller clocks but are not carried in most supermarkets.On the other hand, most small clocks could squeeze in a AAA standard battery just as well.",positive
"The delivery service was fast, the product is just as described, and the price is superb!  I definitely recommend buying from this seller.",positive
"i buy it for use in cactus flash trigger.Works perfectRecommended for this use, good price, good product for the money",positive
"It's not the batteries that I like most about this product. Since batteries are pretty much all the same.  I liked this product because in a singe package it contains to two CR-2 lithium Photo Batteries.  Since I  bought my Minolta SLR camera from Amazon.com, which require two batteries,  this would be a better, and cheaper choice.  Plus it's great for the  Environment too.",positive
"Batteries came loose.  From Amazon, I  expect that the picture is a true representation of the product to be delivered.  First battery works but I don't know the expiration date of the second.  Also, it's not desirable to ship batteries loose without some sort of protection for the terminals.",neutral
Got these batteries as replacement batteries for my rangefinder and this is the cheapest price I found anywhere for these.  Will buy again.,positive
"Walmart wanted twice the price for exact same item.Needed the battery for camera, with no subsitute available. Should have stocked up!!",positive
Standard battery in a 2-pack.  Full voltage (unlike those sold for $1 each and which would not power the light and laser in my pistol gunsight).,positive
The batteries worked well and I was happy with the shipment. This purchase was as I expected when buying batteries,positive
"These batteries fit and operate my minolta maxxum 70 !! They show great use by dates on package, well protected with Styrofoam  noodles in a strong box! Can not ship on commercial passenger airlines sticker is large!!! Excellent Shipper!!!",positive
"I used these batteries to power my Nikon rangefinder for my golf outings.  They seem to last forever, the last one I had last about over 2 years.",positive
"If you look at the picture, the batteries are sealed under plastic. When I got these, the batteries were Scotch taped to the card. I don't have a clue if I got new or used batteries. Next time I would order from some other vendor.",neutral
I replaced the batteries in our wireless motion detector (part of our house alarm system) and they work just fine.,positive
"Great price, less than 50% of retail, and received in less than a week after placing order. The batteries were fresh and worked well in my high end tactical flashlight.",positive
"I ordered a lot of these CRV3 batteries because you can't find them in stores anymore and my camera uses them.  Lasts for a long, long time! Since I travel to Europe, having a disposible battery that will let me take tons of pictures and review images as I need to is important.  Can't do better than this battery!",positive
These 3 volt Li Photo Batteries are used in my home smoke alarms.  The shelf life of these batteries is several years so that even the one in aupstairs bedroom that is hard to hear when the batteries get weak will not cause problems for a long time.The price was right too.,positive
Great quality for the price. I always keep them in the camera bag as back up. never had a probelm yet.,positive
"We have used the CRV3 lithium photo battery in our kodak so we knew what we wanted to purchase however the product that is advertised in the picture is not what arrived. It was a CRV3 but was not ""photo."" i am not sure if this will make a difference, but I need the battery. it happened to be 1 product number off from the lithium photo. I think it should still work fine just my only con.",positive
"Good batteries and good price, i have more tha 4 week with the batteries and they working good without any problem.",neutral
The batteries were the best price I could find and no shipping. I definitely use this Seller again and would recommend that anyone needing photo supplies or batteries check them out,positive
"We get this battery for our 35 mm camera.  Its nice to hsve a spare, and these don't seem to last very long.  We have a couple of them to take on trips.",positive
"A buddy of mine recommended these batteries to me for powering up effects pedals.  I use them in a Maxon Tube Screamer and a Peterson tuner.  These batteries do last longer, and I feel the price difference is justified.  These will also make great backup batteries if your pedal board or power goes out.",positive
"the battery works great it will go into my weather station that uses this type,great deal on the getting the batteries",positive
"Ordered item expecting retail packaging as pictured.Receive loose bulk items.Batteries are new and unused.Batteries work perfectly, just disappointed in packaging.",neutral
"Exactly what i was looking for and I knew it as I have purchased these here before,am very pleased as they were priced reasonably. Thanks, Mike",positive
"The batteries arrived on time, and more importantly, they are 50% cheaper than store-bought.  So far, it's only been a month, so I don't know how long they last yet.",positive
Like to always keep lots of these on hand.  Energizer is always a name I can trust and it is doing the job very well,positive
Got these batteries for 1/2 of what the stores wanted. Saves a lot of money when they cost $7 - 10 a piece!,positive
"I purchased this case hoping it would serve ""double duty"" for me as a wallet and PDA case. While this would be great for anyone who uses a purse or attache case, it does not work for someone like me who wants a pocket sized PDA.This case is well designed, and serves its purpose well. As previously mentioned, I no longer use mine, simply because it adds too much bulkiness to the visor. ...I hope this helps!...",neutral
This thing allows you a grat deal of versatility. especially if you have a Compact Flash Digital Camera A laptop with a PCI card slot and a desktop computer. you can use it much like a zip drive. USB makes easy installation there are driver updates you can get at the viking website if you are running WIN 98,positive
have used it for 8-months now.Fine product!  Good software (basic but reliable)Good price.,positive
"At first I bought this item it worked okay and was better then having to plug my camera in all the time, but after starting to conflict with other software it would lose contact with my computer after a couple uses.  I would have to re-boot to re-establish contact.  I ended up tossing this product.  I recommend a Kodak reader for your Kodak cameras.",negative
The first viking reader I received had a defective eject button.  The second reader would read some PC cards but not others.  The third reader refused to read a second card after the first was removed.  I definately like that the drive treats PC cards like removable media (with no starting and stopping of card services) and if you are a lucky or persistant buyer and they ship you a drive that works this would be a great deal.,negative
"Bought the Viking Intelliflash USB Flash Memory Reader because transferring my digital photos from my camera to the computer was too slow. It would take over 1 minute per photo to transfer.  Now, with the Viking CF reader, it takes about 2-3 seconds per photo to transfer.  It works great!",positive
"Works great with Olympus, Kodak, etc. ALL digital camera flash cards. Simply remove the memory card from your camera, slap it in to the slot and presto... seconds later your images are on your system.Setup was a snap too. Highly recommend!  Much easier than using your camera for uploading pics to your computer.",positive
Had no problems with this reader.  I installed with the latest drivers from their website after reading some of the other reviews found here.  I am very pleased with this reader.  It reads really fast and I like the fact that it can accept all three different types of cards.  The card I use is a compactflash type I that requires the use of the included type II adapter which doesn't bother me a bit.,positive
"This reader works perfectly with my home-built desktop (running Win98 SE) and my Compaq laptop (running WinME). I downloaded the latest drivers from the Viking web page, and I believe these made the difference in the ease of installation.",positive
"this is no longer the option, there are better items, no recommend now, it was good 2 years ago I COULDN CHANGE THE NUMBER OF THE STARS to 2",positive
"When it works, it works flawlessly.  When it doesn't... well, let's say it isn't very pretty.  Rebooting with the card reader plugged into the USB port on a Win2000 box will consistently lead to a Blue Screen of death.  Reader has to be plugged in AFTER Windows boots which is a drag.  Not bad overall, but there has to be better out there.",negative
"Install the driver software, plug it into the USB port. Download How hard is that?I use it for downloading pictures.  It keeps the camera free for taking pictures.  What more can you say, it's about as exciting as a floppy disk drive!BUT, it does what it was advertised to do!",positive
This is a great product. We have two. The XP drivers are available on the Viking website. The download is a snap.,positive
"I bought an MP3 player and found the internal 64 MB was just not enough. This Viking SmartMedia card was the least expensive I found when I shopped around. It comes in its own little plastic holder, was a snap to install in the Rio, and works as it should.",positive
"Bought this for my new Fuji Coolpix 1400. Took the camera to Europe with this card, and took over 125 pictures. I would have been able to take only about 1/5 of that number with the card that came with the camera. It works, the price is right... what more is there to say?",positive
Using this with my Canon A50 allows me to take approximately 280 photos before I have to change cards.  Have used it for almost a year without any problems.  Great value!,positive
"Just got my Memory in today, and what a Deal ! I recommend it for anyone who wants to save money for there Olympus Camera.  I can store 266 SQ-HIGH Pictures, and I also have the Viking PCMCIA Reader/Writer on order so I don't have to download so much.",positive
"This is a fun little device to put in my mp3 player, a Samsung YP-700H.  It also works in PDA's perfectly, because a friend of mine has one with this exact same memory card.  I can only assume it works fine with digital cam's.  As far as mp3 players go, this is sure to work.  If you have a low memory mp3 player, get this if it can expand.  It works wonders.",positive
"I bought this as an accessery for my husband's new digital camera.  He is a serious, amateur photographer, and he is still raving about having the extra picture storage space.  This disc has enough room for a full day's shooting, whether for fun or work. At 2 megapixel resolution it holds about 80 photos.",positive
"It has slowed down my camera significantly from the 2 MB card that was included with it, but I don't think that is a fault of the card, but rather a limitation of the media type.  I believe that is why people are going to compact flash type memory cards now.",positive
"This gadget with the FlashPath adapter is awesome. I would suggest it for anyone who needs reliable data storage transfer. You simply load the driver to a computer and bang, the FlashPath adapter immediately gives you a 32/64/128 MB ""Floppy""[depending on the flash chip you buy]. (...)",positive
I'm a much bigger fan of the Targus folding keyboard.  For starters it folds into the size of a handspring.  Second of all the Landware version's keys are incredibly small.  The one feature benefit of landware is that  it's a rigid design so it can be used on your lap - while the Targus  version is very flexible and needs to be placed on a flat surface to type.,positive
This product was not in functioning condition when delivered. I worked on it and was able to shoot about half a roll before it locked up. a shame.,negative
Good lens for price and great if your a beginner or intermediate photographer. Takes great pictures. Shipped out on time.,positive

"I know I took a chance buying used, but I have to constantly keep is on manual focus to use it. Which is not always easy to get a clear crisp photo when needed to be done fast.",negative
I really like this lens and it help me make the jump from this being a hobby to a business investment. I plan to order all my upgrades from Amazon.,positive
I got this for my grandson to use on a camera you bought at a flea market he loves that thing so glad I could get it for them thanks,positive
"At first was not crazy about the lens, but after I used it a while it was hard at first to get it to focus.  The one down side is it doesn't have stabilizer on it.  I can't wait to get a lens with F aperture under 2.8",positive
"why I got this lens ill never know I may have a problem with buying lenses , yeah that's it. got this used on ebay with the hope it would be sharp....wrong! it was soft through out, if you can get this lens for free that's a deal. don't waste your cash if you like good looking photos.",negative

i've taken a few great pics with this lens! great price too! i'm probably going to end up buying  another one!,positive
"Good lens!  Nice build quality for a plastic lens.  Easy to zoom.  AF works just fine and is very quiet.  The overall picture quality is on a par with a kit lens.  You can get very sharp photos with this lens if you stop it down a bit . F-8 works great!  If I had to buy this lens again, I would get the VR verson for a little more money.  Hence the 4 stars.",positive
Perfect add-on for a Canon EOS Rebel T3!!! This lens will take super-awesome photos close up. Well worth the money!!,positive
"this lens offer a really good photos, but it needs a good light, is well to take pictures with day light, at night is not so good. It's ok for the price, perfect for wildlife pictures.",positive
"Arrived safely and in a good package.  Works as expected.  Nice to have a variety of lens.Sorry, what more to say?",positive
"I also want to rate the seller 5 stars. Quick shipment, nice packaging and brand new product.When I first saw it, it was not as good as 18-135 mm lens on my Canon 60D in building and look.  However, it does its job well in terms of  the light weight and price.  The quality of pictures are acceptable as well. I am happy to have it.",positive
I am a Photography student and wanted to get a new lens so that I could take nature shots and this lens allows me to take amazing pictures of wildlife,positive
"Love this lens, work perfectly and takes beautiful photos. Would definitely recommend this item. May not be the cheapest, but is probably the best for your money if you have a Canon EOS camera.",positive
This should be a standard addition to the Rebel T3. it sure made taking pictures come out better looking. The finish product is excellent with almost every shot I take (and I am a klutz).,positive
This was my first telephoto lens and I got some great pictures with it.  A good starter lens.,positive
"I got this free after rebate from amazon and i could'nt be more happier. I took a few photographs using the built in flash and indoors and the pictures came out pretty good. i am not sure as to why people complain about the build quality and the photo quality.For a starter in SLR photography, this is a good camera lens. for someone who is a pro, may be not!..",positive
I have no complaints with this lens at all. It is great quality for the price. You can get some blur and fuzzy pics when shooting at 300 with no cam stand but that is a given for any budget zoom lens when shooting by hand.,positive
This is a good beginners lens. It works better then the standard 18 - 55 lens that came with my camera.,positive
"Great product, bought it and i haven't returned to my old stock lens. great investment, you will be amazed by it!",positive
"Great lens and Great price! Though it has no image stabilizer on it, it zooms wonderfully and is great for those outdoor shots!",positive
I am a great photographer and I am using a Canon t3 with this Lens I see a little bit of a difference and I do recommend it to whoever need an extra lens,positive

"Simply, u want an average priced canon zoom lens, here it is.I haven't tried different brand cuz I just found and bought this one and it's doing its job.",positive
Super lens at a super price.... great addition to my camera bag. Turns wildlife photos into closeups.,positive
this is great on my canon camera. wish the f stop was a little lower. takes very nice photos. thanks,positive
"Great lens, especially for the price.  Great for taking photos at a ball game.  Very impressed with this lens.  Thanks",positive
Got this lens for $169 but had a $150 coupon code b/c I bought the Rebel T3!  What a great lens for $19!,positive
"As a novice photographer, I've been searching high and low for this lens. And not only was it delivered fast, but also came in it's original box and reading material.I been wanting for this lens for a very long time since a friend loan me his.Now I'm will be taking those pictures that capture the essence of life.Thanks",positive
Decent lens. My daughter will get this for Christmas. $100 discount on lens with purchase of the canon camera. Great deal.Thanks,positive
This lens was purchased for use with a Rebel and has been excellent. It was ready to use the minute it was taken out of the box. Quality in both low light and normal light has been excellent. It is lightweight thus carrying an extra lens is not an issue. These lens are much smaller in size than the Nikon lens I use for my Nikon cameras.,positive
"This lens might be okay for beginners, but if you are into any quality photographyGET THE CANON 70-200 L (f/2.8 or f/4 with or without IS)CONS-Slow aperture-Not sharp enough-Not an L-Paint is chipping offPROS- Cheep, (but not worth it unless you don't care for quality)My recommendation... Buy a Canon 70-200 L instead (even the f/4 will blow this lens away)",negative
I do landscape and wildlife photography and this does a beautiful job of getting me closer than the birds would allow.,positive
"Great Buy. At first i thought I was getting a peace of junk. I have tested this camera several times a day. I have found it to be very usefull for targets that are a little ways out there. I have gone to Freeport, Bahamas and took great pictures with this lens. I am kindaa new to this lens. I have liked taking picture since I was 14 years old and now my hobbie is Photography!",positive
The price was right when I bought this lens. I have seen this lens upwards of $200. Everything works great. Get great results from using it.,positive
This lens is simply amazing! It has amazing focus along with zoom! I find its great for taking night star pictures! Nothing like an amazing lens that takes amazing pictures!,positive
"It's light weight and easy to use.  I wish the manual focus ring had marks, especially for infinity.  It's pictur quality is nice.",neutral
"I really love this lens.  I didn't really know much about cameras before getting my latest Canon T2i and this lens. I know it is 75mm-300mm, but I didn't realize you had to be 5 ft away to get a decent close-up shot; more my fault.  Otherwise, this lens has a great zoom capability and it's easy to operate.",positive
This lens without I.S. is useless without a tripod. There is no way to hold it steady at this magnification. I did have it on a tripod for what I was shooting and it Produced beautiful results.,positive
Been using this for a while and it still works great. The zoom is awesome and works great for long distance shots.,positive
Good for its price but if you are not on budget I recomend investing in a better lens such as a sigma.,positive
Have had some good pics with it. The USM is super helpful. The only thing is that it's a little more difficult to use in lower light settings.,positive
Have not really used it as of yet....But cant wait to start.....Hopefully it performs well as many have giving the lense great reviews.....I will let you know later the results....!!!!,positive
"This is my favorite lens I own; one of the best purchases I've ever made. It's so much easier and more fun when using this lens to get up really close. I think the quality of the lens is great too.Just know, that it won't be great indoors because the lighting gets off; it's best for outdoor activities.",positive
"I only use Canon lenses. I trust the quality and accuracy. This lens is no exception. It is easy to use, easy to adjust and brings in beautiful pictures. This one is especially good for long distance objects like the moon or mountains.",positive
"I use this on my canon rebel t1i it is great for that far away shot,You cant go wrong and at 99.00 dollars a great deal.",positive
"I own the 55-250 IS and I've been using it for a while. I borrowed this lens the other day just to test it, and it was terrible in comparison. Soft, no IS, noticeable chromatic aberration over 230mm. It is better than it's predecessor (the II) but still not a good lens. go for the 55-250 and you won't regret it.",negative
Nice affordable lense in adequate lighting or with a good strong flash.  Fast silent auto-focus.,positive
Very quick delivery and it was better by far than the one I had and broke.,positive
This lens seems to not work well with my camera and I really don't know what the problem is as it does not take good pictures when I attach it to my camera.,neutral
This was purchased to replace my old &#34;identical&#34; (scratched) lens.  Shipped fast & price was excellent! This is a good multi-purpose zoom lens!,positive
Provides a good basic addition to the lens collection that can be used for everyday school sporting events as well as other outdoor activities requiring some distance from the action.,positive
"I have taken some excellent images with this lens, I use it almost every day. The only thing that irks me, and it may be me, but too often, the auto-focus over shoots the target and looses focus at the least opportune times... but overall I am happy with it's capabilities.",positive
"I'm just an amateur. I admittedly have not taken a lot of photos with this lens, but the ones that I have taken have turned out fairly nice.I'm starting to take more outdoors photos, so having a lens like this was important to get a closer view of things that happen to be far away. It does the job. I should update the review when I've used it more often.",positive
"An older zoom telephoto but still does a good job.  Does not have the USM quiet motor, and of course, no stabilization but still a good buy if you use a tripod for your long shots.",positive
"i haven't gotten to REALLY put this lens to the test but from what i have shot so far, this seems to be a great option if you want a long lens for a low price.",positive
"I bought this lens for my wife as she is trying to get her own photography business going, and she needed a more telephoto lens.  According to her this lens has worked perfectly for her, and she has gotten some great shots with it.  Camera base is a canon EOS 10d.",positive
"for the price this is a very good lens, i've used it numerous times and i'm very satisfied with it",positive
"this is a good lens.. wish it was an efs, so much easier to shoot with.. have to have a steady hand or tripod to shoot with this one.. not a lens for a beginner..",positive
"Great for all sorts of stuff, especially at taking pictures. Haven't used it for a game of toss yet. Word.",positive
"It is a good product, BUT I should have kept saving money and buy the $500 75-300mm telephoto for photographing college baseball.",neutral
"Pictures in low light conditions were not that good, pictures at mid-range were ok, I could take better portraits with it than zoom shots.My cousin dropped it once(rolled off the car seat); the drop broke off the AF/MF button. I have still been able to use it though it has trouble auto focussing.",neutral
"Even though the speed is slow, it's great for outdoor shooting. You can't beat the price for an entry level lens.",positive
Hard to hate on the lens. Functions well I can see the field up close event with I am sitting in the nosebleeds.,positive
It was a good purchased for the price but the quality of the pictures are not that good. I took a few pictures at a baseball stadium and did not  came out with the quality I expected.,neutral
Great price on a great item.  Fast shipping and entirely pleased with the whole experience!,positive
"This lens was a step up for me and I use a tripod most of the time so compared to the $500+ IS lens this was a great buy. Clear sharp photos, just what I was looking for.",positive
"I was glad to get the replacement lense since my original one was stolen from my house.  When I installed it onto the camera and placed it on Auto focus option,  the lense kept trying to focus going back and forth but never stops attempting to focus on anything,",neutral
I love this lens for my Canon 50D.  I bought it to replace a Tamron 70-300mm.  It was a good lens but it started giving me error readings on my camera. Since I have been using the Canon 75-300 I have not gotten any messages.  Good quality and reasonable price.,positive
I use this as my long distance lens and I love it. Its not a fast speed lens but I used it to shoot various football games and it worked quite well. I'm very happy with this purchase and would gladly buy more lenses like this.,positive
"I dig this lens a lot but the only negative is the weight. I'm a totally amateur photographer and when you zoom all the way in, the photos come out a little blurry because the lens is so heavy that the camera shakes. Got a tripod the other day and my blurry photo problem went away.",positive
Did a bit of research on different lenses and for what I wanted to do this was a perfect fit. Pleased and enjoy using it. First night I went out and took a picture of the moon and it was fantastic.,positive
I use this lens with my rebel 300 and have had no problems. I read the other reviews and took their advice on changing f stop and everything has worked great. I have taken shots of hawks on the fly and the shots have come out very clear. When I save up some money maybe I'll buy a IS lens but right now this works just fine.,positive
Since getting this lens I no longer miss out on far away images. Works perfectly with my Canon camera. The images are sharp and the learning curve isn't very difficult to get those pictures perfectly. The quality is very high in this lens. Very very happy.,positive
I tried it inside the building without a tripod and most pictures were useless because it doesn't have Image stabilization. I'm planning to sell it on ebay.,neutral
This 75-300 lens will allow me to take pictures of the little subjects. Also allows me to make long distance close up. The lens was well packaged so as not to get damaged and was as described. Thanks Amazon.,positive
"Some people talk about this lens as being inferior to it's expensive cousin, but I don't find that at all..",positive
"I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.",positive
I'm just a hobbyist.  I like to take pictures for fun.  Maybe a more serious photographer would have problems with image quality; maybe not!  I don't know! All I know is that this lens works great and gives me photos that I love.  I recommend it wholeheartedly.,positive
Clarity and ease of use are exceptional - wonderful for closing the gaps from where you are and the subject is. Purchased this lens as part of my self made package when I purchased my Rebel T3,positive
"The lack of an IS kind of sucks, but other that it's a solid lens for the price, perfect for shooting wildlife and other things in the distance.",positive
"I am not a professional photographer but when it comes to zoom lenses I can say I am truly satisfied by what this lens does for me.The pictures are sharp, the autofocus mechanism works great and the lens is affordable enough for me.It is not a paparazzi type lens but that's not what I use it for. It has a nice feel to it and is not too heavy.I recommend it.",positive
Great product!It's not too expensive comparing with another options and my pictures results are very good to me. Ok.,positive
"Great lens.  I love this lens, the clarity is amazing, and the quality is top shelf.  This is the reason Cannon is the best there is.",positive
"I'm trying to get into the portrait photography business. I just got this lens and wow, I love it! Gives that great upclose/shallow depth of field look for portraits. It's wonderful. I couldn't ask for a better telephoto lens to start out w/. I'm sure this probably isn't the best lens for some higher end professional shots, but for starting out, especially w/ portraits this is an awesome lens. I'd definitely recommend it to other beginning photographers.",positive
This lens gives me the ability to shoot at longer distances and get closer to objects that the normal lens would have trouble getting close to .It works on my camera very well. I'm very pleased with it and would recomment it to a friend.,positive
"I like this lens because of the moire you get when zooming.It's sharp, well contrasted collors and not heavy or volky.Came fast, well packaged and I recomend it.",positive
"Excellent lens, clear and clear. Just one issue, in long range distances it takes some time to focus.",positive
This replaced one I lost.  It's a great lens and is so helpful getting those far-away shots. It's a must have for anyone who loves photos.,positive
The lens is exactly what the description says it is. A normal Canon zoom lens. Works great and I am loving it,positive
I am not a photographer so I am not picky :) it goes on easily and take extremely sharp photos. No complains.,positive
"i didnt expect it to be as good as its higher end model wich i think is like almost double in price. but it works amazing. has a good range of zoom. focuses quickly. only thing is if your looking to shoot anything in very low lighting, it wont come out too good even with your highest ISO setting. but overall it gets the job done.",positive
"Man, I used this extension to captured the F-16 frying above my house during their exercise from the fleet week in Miramar. Good quality for the price.",positive
I am able to get clear and crisp images of landscapes and cityscapes. Would recommend this product to any photographer.,positive
Awesome addition to my rebel t3i. Takes incredible pictures from pretty far away. I am still getting used to the camera and all the settings but even on auto mode the lens works very well. I am by no means a photographer but for my needs it is amazing. The lens easily attaches to the camera and comes with two caps for both sides of the lens to keep the dust out and protected when not in use.,positive
This lens is great for backyard shots oh the fauna we have.  Brings in nice clear shots and is a mount I am used too.,positive
This has been a fun lens to play with!  I have been able to use this lens just fine without a tripod and still get great pics!  I don't know much about the logistics of this lens but I have had a great expierence with it and am glad I bought it!,positive
"I love it ...It's cheap, good looking, long zoom, easy to take the pics too far from.sometime spy for babe bikini( hahahaha )just for people learn how to play with camera, like me....forget about Professional one.",positive
I wasn't looking for the best Canon lens since I'm new to the DSLR game. With $169 I can take some nice nature and sports pictures. If I ever learn more it will be worth inxesting to what is advertised as a better lens of this type. The particular lens is clear and brings things closer as described. No defects. I recommend it to anyone who wants to just bring themes closer without going pro or braking the bank.,positive
"Thank you for this lens, I got a lot of shot for Inauguration Ceremonies on January 21, 2013 for our President OBAMA 2nd turn,I had been down there from the 18 of January 2013 to the 22, 2013.",positive
it my first telephoto lens and it great and the price was just right and feels strong and the action smooth action feels great going for some of the action shots,positive
Manually crank the lens to 300mm Infinity and nothing in focus. Back it off a bit and now it is in focus.,negative
"I purchased this lens with my minimalist budget in mind, and I must say that for the money, it isn't too bad.  It lacks a fancy focus motor (i.e. USM), which makes it a bit slow and noisy, but you can't find a more inexpensive long distance telephoto lens.  It is perfect for the amateur photographer without a lot of money.",positive
"This is a good lens for the price. I ended up getting the nicer version of this so I will no longer use it, but it is still a great lens!",positive
"Lens functions OK, no issues there.  What is disturbing is its ability to clearly focus.  All my distance shots are &#34;fuzzy&#34;  As a test, I took a shot at mid range or 150 mm and magnified it with standard photo editing software.  All the detail was fuzzy.  I took another lens and performed the same test and the magnified image was sharp.  I now have a rather pricey paper weight.",negative
"wou ld recom mend th is le ns , gr eat pri ce for a gre at pro duct .",positive
"Haven't got to use it as much as I would have liked, but I did like it the few times I used it.  Graet shipping. Will buy from this seller agin. Thanks!",positive
"300mm is a pros. Better use tripods or use it under strong lightings, like other telephote lens. Some one may not like its plastic design and outter focus design, which most of beginners don't mind. But it has ultrasonoic motors. Of course if you have money, get the XXB.",positive
"I am a dad that likes to take pictures of my kids. I feel that this could be a little better, forgive me that I cannot put to technical terms what I find wrong with this. Just does not work that great for me. Good quality, well made, but seems lacking in the focus. I hope this makes some sense. Happy that I bought here for 50% less than Canon sells for.",neutral
"I upgraded from a 80-200 to this lens and have really appreciated the extra range.  Sure this isn't a professional lens, but for us advanced amateurs it offers all the versatility at a very affordable price.  My only problems with this lens is that focus tends to be slow and the barrel is a little stiff.  I'd still highly recommend it though.",positive
"I bought this for my dad as a gift and he likes it, no complains so I guess this is a pretty good lens.",positive
"I am satisfied because of the price. I was expecting a far greater zoom capability, but it's better than the lens that came with my T3. I find no reason to get the more expensive versions with the IS because I have steady hands. I would recommend it.",neutral
"I really enjoy this lens. Prop up a tripod and a remote shutter and I can get some amazing shots of the moon. I just wish I spent a little more to get the image stabilized one; but alas, I had no money at the time but really wanted to get some photos.",neutral
I have been wanting a lens that did what this baby can do. Very pleased with the quality and for the price.,positive
Ihavent got the chance to use it alot but so far its a good lens need to take some more outdoor shots to really test it out but so far its a pretty good lens its stable and its well made,positive
"I guess the universe sensed how much I really wanted a 300mm lens.  I would always search for sales and just dreamed.  But how can I afford one of these lenses? Then one day, this guy popped up for $100.00... Canon yet!  Sure it was &#34;Used&#34; but for $100.00, it was worth a try.  This was more within my budget and I am very, very happy and grateful!",positive
"A good lens bearing in mind the price. The real downside is it's weight. If you don't frame that shot reasonably quickly, you will end up with numerous shots of your shoes....as I did!Use a tripod.",positive
I am not new to Canon lens' so I was not surprised to know I was getting a great product.  Sure there are more expensive and better overall lens but this one will fit your need if your just a amateur/hobbyist like me.  Never a issue one time.,positive
"This lens have really delivered the versatility it promised. I have taken pictures of my friend, who is my neighbor, from about 100 yards away and the quality of the picture was as if I was within 10 feet of him.  Its a nice lens and I would recommend it to anyone who doubts the amount of satisfaction they will receive  from their investment.Otto G.",positive
"I have used this lens on a Canon 60D, 7D and 5Dm2 with no problems...the IS wouldve been nice but for what I paid for it there is no complaints. Not as fast but definitely doable...",positive
Greatest price I've ever seen on a 300 mm lens for a Canon SLR.  It can really help with those long distance shots.,positive
"If you don't have &#34;surgeon steady&#34;hands this lens will only work sometimes and a tripod or monopod are going to be needed. Because it is not &#34;Is&#34; (Image Stabilizer) it  becomes hard to take a still, specially in low light.",neutral
I bought this lens specifically for still close-up photography. It's a great value and is the typical solid Canon quality that I expected. Pleas keep in mind this lens does NOT have IS (Image Stabilization) so it can be tricky to get clear shots without use of a tripod. This is a great lens to add to your Canon Camera.,positive
When i bought it it cost about 600 plus insurance of 200 wow what a deal! Kinda salty though because the price is so much cheaper.,positive
"I am buying the Rebel T4i with the default 18-55 lens. I am looking for an additional lens for a bit longer range. I am leaning towards this model but also came across this one ""Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS II Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras"" Could someone please illustrate the differences between these models?",positive
"This is everything that I expected it to be, and a good deal. It doesn't have Image Stabilization, but it's still not too bad to hold. Just the thing I needed for shooting soccer games!",positive
"Returned it in 2 days.  Just awful.  Poor focusing and lots of hunting for focus on my Digital Rebel.  Slowness made every shot underexposed.  Lens mounted to the camera losely, so you could wiggle the lens.  Lens gave error 99's on the EOS.Avoid this product.Update:  Purchased the Canon EF 75-300mm f4-5.6 IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens and it is absolutely wonderful.  Worth the extra money for better glass, Image stabilization, and faster focusing.",negative
"There is no doubt that the IS version must be better...but the price is good, and the lensa is very good too! I've used it in different conditions, and the results have been great. I highly recommend this lens.",positive
Super product that brings lots of new opportunities to my photography. Lens allows for fine tuning of each position and allows me to crop while I shoot.,positive
It performs well very well for the price. I use the lense a lot since purchasing it. I love it.,positive
"Although somewhat limited in that you only have two F-stops: f/4 and f/5.6,; you have five focal lengths you can choose from: 75mm, 100mm, 135mm, 200mm, and 300mm making it a lens you can use for portriats or landscapes.",positive
Nice lens and focuses quickly enough for non-sports activities.  Used this with an APS-C body on an Alaskan glacier tour and got great results!,positive
"I love how perfect this lens is for photographing and even filming sports. I am not a fan of the auto focus mechanism, but otherwise it is perfect. The zoom is deep enough for all kinds of fields/ action shots. It's small enough to not weigh down a neck strap or bag, but does everything I need it to do.",positive
"Awesome product, price, and delivery. I am 100% satisfied with this camera. Purchased as a Bundle with bag and 300mm zoom lens. I have been pricing this camera for 6months, and although everyone is reducing price due to release of T4, Amazon was the lowest out of all. With the bundle this lens only cost $10.00",positive
"This is a good lens, however it does suffer from chromatic abberations!  Which if you use adobe light room can be fixed.  Sharpness is good though even at 300mm. Which is more than I can say for the $400 Nikkor 55-300 vr that I bought for my Nikon camera!  If you have a little time to invest in photo editing this lens does just fine!",positive
"I bought this to use along with the ""Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 ImagingBody + 18-55mm lens."" I have been using this set up for a while now and am very pleased. It does everythingit is supposed to do, and it does it without a lot of headaches/hassles. Highly Recommended!!",positive
I am an amateur at photography but I love this lens. It's a bit bulky but no more than any other lens like it would be. It gives great image quality and works well with both manual and automatic focus. Definitely worth the money!,positive
just remember that at this price there is no image stabilization. So bright light and fast shutter speeds are called for. a good lens none the less.,positive
I have only been able to give it a brief test and it seems to be working great. So far so good.,positive
The lens arrived on time for Christmas and was packaged very well.  I wasn't concerned about any damage during shipping.  I actually bought it for my sister.  She was able to open it right up and put it on her Canon.  It works great.,positive
"Witout spending loads of money this lens does the trick very neatlyGreat zoom at a very fair price, I am very happy with it all around",positive
"I am satisfied with this lens w.r.t the price i have paid for this. $120 is very cheap. Agred, it does not have USM. But i am able to take some good photos with this lens. Though i haven't tried sports photography yet. I would recomend this lens to photography learners, and those does not want to pay more money for USM or IS functionality.",positive
have been able to take great zoom shots on my eos 7d even though it is not an is lens.,positive
Bought this lense and it works great for my Canon SLR Rebel 2000!  Payed under $120...half of the retail price!,positive
This product was a wondferful product and helped me a lot when i had to take pictures from far distances.,positive
Great lens. A must-have for every photographer.,positive
Not a lot I can say about this lens other than it is typical Canon in that it does what it is supposed to. You get more than what you pay for with this lens because of the auto focus feature. Not all telephoto lenses are equal especially not equal to a Canon. I highly recommend this lens.,positive
So far so good.  I have only had a chance to use this lens a few times.  So far it works fine and the pictures and zoom application are as expected.  The only down point was that the shipment took forever 3 plus weeks to arrive.  It was not the fault of the vendor but rather the carrier.  I would and will buy more products from this vendor.,positive
Takes great telephoto shots while using a tripod. If looking to take these kind of photos without a tripod you may want look into one with IS unless you have a steady hand. I had borrowed this same lens for a week from a friend and then decided to purchase. I am very pleased with this lens.,positive
This lens is amazing!!  It allows me to take pictures of birds sitting on my bird feeder in my back yard.  The pictures are great!!,positive
But I don't take that many pictures from that far away.  I'm just a Dad taking pictures of his kids in action.  I usually don't carry this lens with me.  But I have used it and it does get me closer to the action when I'm not close.,positive
This is arguably Canon's weakest telephoto lens that they produce.  You are better off spending a little more money and getting the Canon EF-S 55-250.  They are both entry level zoom lenses but the 55-250 gives you much better image quality plus Image Stabilization.,neutral
awsome for close ups this takes very good pictures. its not that heavy either. i use this itme with my cannon rebel xs,positive
I was worried about purchasing this older model of the Canon Flashes since i didn't know if it was compatible with newer rebel DSLR cameras. After researching and getting nothing on google i took a leap of faith and walla! It works wonderful with my Rebel T3! Its sturdy and works wonderful. I just thought i'd write a review on this flash and the compatibility in case there is someone else like me wondering.,positive
i purchase this used and the company is awesome. It didnt come with the box but its working good. You have to buy a canon flash for your canon camera. This will adjust and made for canon so you dont have to do a lot of ISO adjustments...,positive
"Certainly a better us of my hard-earned government pension.I spent about the same amount of money on my FIRST new car:a 1972 Chevrolet Vega -- boy! Was THAT a waste of $1875...spent the ame amount on my Canon binoculars, and CAN even seeSatelites pass by... if I'm patient.Imissd the asteroid last Friday, but Russia didn't. Sorry, THATwas uncalled for.Great bi-nos!",positive
"Get these binoculars, if you can afford them.  I have looked at, or through, Zeiss and Leicas, and the Canon's are of equal quality.The image stabilization works, period.  You can see detail that is NOT possible without IS.  Also, the binoculars are very usable without the IS feature, more so than I would have thought.My suggestion, buy the highest magnification that will fit your application, since IS gives the greatest benefit at higher powers.",positive
Simply Amazing!  Great field of view and easy focus.  Best binoculars I have ever used.  I have used regular 18x50 binoculars in the past and always found it challenging to hold the image steady watching sporting events. The stabilization feature is terrific.  The rock solid image is definitely worth the cost.,positive
"These are nice optics! So, Canon, why not include dust lens covers?! Come on!Buyers: plan on purchasing pairs of screw on UV filters to protect the coated optices and lens caps!",neutral
"Great optics. Surprisingly bright and excellent for star gazing. I can actually see the moons of Jupiter with them.Issues- Protective caps don't stay on.. ever- Sucks up batteries pretty quickly- A bit heavyStill 5 stars. One of my all-time favorite expensive purchases.[update]To get caps to stay on, purchase UV filters for the lens. These lens fit standard camera filters size 52mm. Then the caps fit nicely. Also, protects the lens from accidental scratches.",positive
Pros: great reach for the price. Feels well made in my hands. Takes nice pictures. very little if any distortion on the edges of my pictures.Cons: Higher F stop means it struggles under low light conditions.All in all its pretty much exactly what I expected.,positive
"I'm a causal photographer and I love this lens. I take all sorts of different pictures, majority of them outdoors.",positive
"Was a great lens for shooting candids at outdoor events, but next time I'll get something with a better aperture for a nice blur in the background. At f4.5, all the people in the background were too clear and it took away from the subject.So- great lens, just didn't work for candids in a crowd like I had hoped. Live and learn.",positive
"This lens is cheap and very light. Admittedly I wasn't very impressed at first, but with addition of a sigma UV filter my pictures at 200mm are now clearer and a truer reflection of the subject. At 200 the pictures tend to be a bit soft, but it's noticeable unless you do some serious cropping. With this lens I also prefer to shoot with auto zoom instead of manual zoom.",neutral
"I bought this lens on the advice of the other reviewers, and I was not at all disappointed. This is a fantastic lens for what you pay. It is indeed a light light lens and it almost feels ""cheap,"" but it functions great and takes great shots. When focusing manually, it doesn't feel as smooth as some other lenses. But you really can't go wrong with this lens.",positive
"What a great flash. I am going to replace my studio lights with these little babies. Powerful and controllable, all that's missing is modeling light. I have been using a miniature flashlight to act as a modeling light.",positive
"The best feature of this flash is the wireless E-TTL feature.  With two 550ex's one will work as a master and one as a slave and with the ST-E2 both flashes can be off camera and fired E-TTL.  The draw backs are: price, no manual control in slave mode for greater light control, and size (this thing is big).  The plus side weighs out the negatives.  It is a great flash.",positive
"Top of the line.  Works as advertised.  TTL, E-TTL.  4 double AA batteries.  Tilt, Rotate head, soft lens built in.  Can control slave flash.",positive
"Use it on my T2i and with another 550 in wireless mode.  Love it, works very well, good features and function.",positive
I've been using this for about 4 months now and it's serving it's purpose well. the cleaning tip takes out the smudges well and the retractable brush is gentle enough on your lens.this tool is a must have for all photographers and this product is doing great considering its price.,positive
Good tool for removing any smudges on the lens. Safer than using a microfiber cloth that may have collected dust particles.,positive
Never had one of these before..  easy to carry and use and really works a treat !I searched around until I found a marker cap that fits the brush end so dirt can't get into retracted brush between uses.  they should have done that but none of the brands do that I've seen.Good item..Caution;  Some other well known brands of the SAME tool can cost over $20 and seem to be the same Mfg.,positive
Works as described.  Good construction for a plastic brush pen.  Nothing bad to say about it.  It wiped off marks on the front element.  You def purchase again.,positive
"Who needs ANOTHER cleaning kit? This one does it all. Very handy lens cleaning tool easily used to remove dust, fingerprints, smudges, etc. from your lenses.  Buy two - one for the camera bag and one for the home.  A must have.",positive
A great way to keep your lens/camera clean and ready for that perfect shot!,positive
"Will be ordering a few more!!!Not just for lenses though,anything that gets dust,sand,dirt etc.Safely removes dangerous particles. Just remember to keep IT clean.",positive
I've used Lens Pens since they were introduced. The chamois end is great for smudges and I've never damaged a lens coating with it. I never use the brush end since it is rather coarse. I prefer a bulb blower and a goat hair artist's brush.,positive
"I should have taken measurements of my camera before bying this item.  I havea small sony cybershot. I was able to clean the lens with this, but only withthe tip at an extreme angle wiping with the edge of the little round disk.  Itdid the trick, but this device is not for pocket size cameras. It's for largerlenses only.  The brush, however, is very handy.  I keep it in the pouch withmy camera when traveling",neutral
"I was a little leary of using anything on my lenses, so I tried out the pen on a couple of filters first. Once satisfied, I cleaned all my lenses without encountering any problems. Easily portable, I just toss it into my camera bag.",positive
These pens work great for cleaning camera lens' and they fit into most cases so you can take it with you.  would purchase again,positive
"Very useful tool, works great! It was able to clean the edges of my lens that regular lens paper can't. The brush is made of soft bristles so it won't scratch your lens plus it's retractable. It seems this Sima lens pen is also the same as the Nikon lens pen that sells for $20!",positive
"It works, it works!  Great antidote for curious young fingers and clumsy old ones.  And you can carry it anywhere, as you would a thick pen with a good clip.Note that Nikon sells an identical item for slightly more.  Actually, the plastic slider button is a different color, but otherwise it is identical.  I wonder who the OEM is?",positive
"i am totally satisfied with olympus c-3000, i was told i would recieve the camera in the alotted time and was impressed when it came a few days early, my only problem with the package was it was missing a memory card, but two out of three ain't bad!:)",positive
"I've used my C3000 for years. While it's only 3.2MP, I momentarily relegated to a shoebox while a new 5MP Sony DSC-P93 took the limelight.I ended up selling the Sony and going back to the Olympus, which takes outstanding shots indoors and out.",positive
"I had this Olympus for many years now and it's still working GREAT!  After Olympus, I've owned PowerShot, Finepix (2 of them) and I have to say this C3000 is still my favorite!  It's the only camera I know that allows zoom function while recording video.",positive
"I've clicked away through Costa Rica, Ireland, Lake Tahoe (skiing - finally lost the easily popped-off lens cap) and many other places. Excellent camera - sometimes need to ""touch up"" photos, but overall sturdy, great image quality and full of features. I am extremely satified with Olympus cameras - both film and digital (I also use Pentax film and Canon ELPH digital).",positive
"Good Camer.This was a direct replcement for the same camera that was to expensive to repair, so buying a used one was more economical.",positive
"I bought the minolta x-570 to use for my photography class in school. turned out to be one great camera! i love that I can use any minolta lens on my sony a65 so it works awesome. light weight body, with great features with a cheap price. recommend using the ilford 400 film.",positive
"My absolute favorite camera I own. The first camera I owned too. Nothing can compare to the look of film, and the feel of this camera. Beautiful piece of engineering. If the model I own breaks I'll buy another, and another. I love this camera that much. Wouldn't trade this for any digital.",positive
"An external antenna is a must. I take this with me whether I use my car or someone elses car, or a rental-- I consider it worth the ""trouble"" of carrying it around. You really never know when you will absolutely need it, and I'd rather have it with me than not.Cobra is a good brand name, and I am happy with this hand-held.",positive
"After I changed the Midland 18-2424 antenna from a PL-249 plug to a BNC plug with an inexpensive Radio Shack adapter, I plugged in, turned on and started receiving chatter from miles away. Haven't figured out the greatest possible distances yet but I have not had any trouble picking up more talk than I can listen to. Transmits well - have not had a problem speaking to truckers from my car. Love it!",positive
"works fine, but range is very limited. During an emergency, I am not sure how good this will work in the woods",neutral
"This is a nice quality radio, I really appreciate the solid feel at has.  I use it ATVing or on road trips with more than one vehicle.  My wife commutes a good distance, and in the winter this is in her car.  It makes me happier knowing that she can call for help if she needs too.",positive
"It is a ok unit. I do not know about putting another outside ant on it, As it is only going too be used to go 4 wheeling with, The rules say one must have a radio, Range is short about a mile, Which works for the need. I have a 29 in my Jeep, this one was a gift to my wheeling partner so not to have to mount anything. So it works I can say that.",neutral
I was able to raise a couple folks on radio checks so it works. I'm not an avid radio operator so I may not be the one to review this item,positive
I use this when I travel up north on I95. I hooked it up with a portable outside antenna and it worked great. I would suggest this setup for anyone that uses it traveling. You would need to buy an adaptor piece (Cobra HA-BNC BNC to Standard Connector for Hand-Held CB Antennas)  that fits the antenna to the top of the scanner. I use the Little Wil antenna with this and it works terrific.,positive
"The CB works great.I do however suggest having an external whip antenna if you want better performance, you do not NEED it though.",positive
"This handheld cb radio is AWSOME, it comes with a rubber intena, a car power supply for on the road use, and some packs on how to use and the rules. PROS AND CONSPros:Small,Manny Channels,able to scan the channels,Able to have different antenna attachments,10 weather channels.Cons:Only about a 2.5 mile range when lots of trees and houses are around,Antenna is a bit small for range.But all in all this radio is great!",positive
This item was packed fine and arrived in working order. Takes too many batteries and does not get full power output as described.,negative
"Still have it, in case of emergency.  Cell phones are not reliable.  Ham radio is the only communication works.  Will buy more",positive
"This is not a high end unit but it works great for camping and road trips with other cars in your group. I really like the weather channel. I only use the cigarette lighter for power because this thing will go through batteries like Obama through your tax dollars. Very quick delivery,",positive
We carry when we are outside our pilot cars to talk to the truck driver while helping to park or manuver a oversize load. Some states require us to have a handheld CB so I pick the best. the price on amazon is the best any where.  I would recommend the cobra to any one.,positive
We bought this radio as a backup to our mobile radio in case our unit failed.  But we have used it as a loaner to others in the group that did not have radios.  It has worked great!,positive
Awesome!  Setup is quick. Works great with my ipaq 1910 !!!,positive
"This is a really great addition to my Handspring Prism. It basically turns your PDA into a compact laptop.  I use it for typing my schedule (with 3 kids and being a graduate student there is a lot of that!!!), typing my notes for class (and in class), making study guides, flashcards, etc.  I take it when we have to wait and my 6-year old uses it for letter recognition (so it's really sturdy).  I love it.",positive
"This keyboard feels very much like a regular fullsize keyboard. I found it easier to use than the smaller versions. The keys have a great feel to them, and your hand rests comfortably in position. There are even places to put your stylus. I love this thing!",positive
"I take great pride in my ability to write quickly using the Visor's built-in handwriting recognition software. But I can type a heck of a lot faster than I can scribble, so I use this keyboard whenever I can. It folds up into a package about the same size as my Visor Prism, which is twice the thickness of the Visor Platinum. If you need to enter a lot of data, this is the only way to go.",positive
This keyboard turns your visor into an ultra light weight laptop computer without all the unnecessary bulk.  Carrying the keyboard and PDA is like having a full laptop in your back pocket without the weight or size of a laptop.,positive
"I thought this was a great purchase for my handspring for those times when I was on the road and wanted to Sync with my laptop computer.  Unfortunately, it did not work with my Visor Deluxe and so far I have been unable to understand why.The trouble started when I went to sync and discovered that there was no HotSync button anywhere on the cable.  Unable to start the process, I gave up.",negative
"Pretty darn close to being plug and play!  Set your computer to DHCP, use your browser to configure a couple of parameters provided by your ISP, and you are off and running.  Can be the DHCP server for 50 computers and a firewall.",positive
This unit was very easy to setup to get connected to the Internet.  Nice web interface to configure unit.  Easy enough for non-technical computer users but also has advanced features.,positive
"The Linksys Cable/DSL router works. You plug it in, connect your computer and modem to it and then add your internet username and password to the router using a simple web browser interface.  That's as hard as it gets installing this device.  I've installed several of these for clients where reliability and ease of use are key considerations. The Linksys router does what it's supposed to simply and effectively.",positive
"This is such a great product.  Within 10 minutes of its arrival at the front door, I had it hooked up into my network and it was functioning flawlessly.  Management is easy and intuitive and installation couldn't be simpler.  I highly recommend this product!",positive
"returned my netgear and bought the linksys, worked on the first try, using dhcp,  the 1.36 firmware, did not allow port forwarding, so i backed it down to 1.34 and it port forwards just fine, tech support was helpful as well, and did not have to wait 2 hours to get hung up on",positive
"The one-port variety means you have to have a separate hub, but I prefer keeping things modular so if one piece breaks you only have to replace that one piece.  Some of the other brands offer more functionality like a print server, that some people may need.  I just care about the built in DHCP server and firewall.",positive
I bought this product after some friends of mine recommended it to me. It took me less than 30 minutes to get evenrything up and running. I have 3 PCs and a laptop and I now have internet access from all the m/cs.  Very simple configurations and easy to set up and works great! I highly recommend it.,positive
I think I ended up selling this camera on eBay for parts. The button on top broke and I think It had some type of error. Overall it was a great little camera that fit right into your pocket.,neutral
"The S100 is simply amazing.  If the camera were any smaller, it would be difficult to use.  And the price is very reasonable, especially when you consider that it comes with a rechargable lithium ion battery and a  charger.  In the past, you would have to spend around $100 for just the  battery and charger.",positive
"Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another. One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was. While he was talking, I took my S100 out of the front pocket of my Levi's and took his picture. I said, can your fancy camera do that? No, because he doesn't (can't) always carry his with him.End of story.",positive
"And I still use it, though in a soft rubber waterproof case. It works MUCH better than the inexpensive toy digital cameras intended for snorkeling. The original and a second battery that I bought when the camera first came out are still working fine. There's a 128MB compact flash card in the camera that just stays in there. For most photography have long since moved on to Canon DSLRs, but this is still handy when diving or snorkeling.",positive
"I love this camera!the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!",positive
The quarter inch size is the perfect size for the spines of the CD jewel cases.  I use them all of the time to label my CDRs.  Good for other small jobs too.,positive
"I like the smaller size of this label tape, it makes a veryprofessional looking label, which can be used on a varietyof objects.  None of these tapes are inexpensive, but theresults are impressive.",positive
"I use this 1/4"" tape on all types of surfaces. It is easy to read and sticks well. Makes orginizing easy.",positive
"We use these for labeling the small tupperware containers that are part of my daughter's lunch box.The black on white tape give much clearer readability than the black on clear tapes.The small size 1/4&#34; are good for this purpose -- but as they are very thin labels, we haven't found a great many other uses for these smaller tapes.",positive
"I purchased this Brother P-Touch tape for an older P-Touch labeler, and the tape jammed. For some reason, the older printer works better with 3/4"" tape, though it is rated for the 1/4"" width, too.I used another new tape in this same label printer, and it broke. I contacted Brother to ask about a replacement, and never heard from them.",neutral
"I love my P-Touch labeller - my kitchen, my office and my bathroom all show signs of avid labeling.  I was excited to get additional tapes and this was a great price - they work as advertised!",positive
I bought this to label my CD cases and the size is just right for the full thickness cases. I am sure I will find other uses for this narrow size.,positive
"This laminated tape is excellent.  I use it to print labels for my daughter's bottles at daycare.  I have the dishwasher set to heated dry time in order to sanitize the bottles and the tape has survived five cycles so far without melting or moving.  It's wonderful.The print is clear and not runny and because the laminate is placed over the printing, it continues to look as great as when I first printed them.",positive
Purchase was for a major brand product and much less than retail. I would buy here again!,positive
great tape for labeling. letters are clear & readable. stay's put & the perfect size for my Brother machine. fine,positive
"This RED on WHITE tape is my favorite. It STANDS out and is easy to read from a distance. If you need something NOTICED. This is the tape to use.The finish is very professional and one applied it stays STUCK!Now, if only it would GLOW in the dark..then I would be ecstatic!",positive
"The Brother red on white, black on white and clear tapes dispense from the Brother label machine excellently.  Most importantly, the labels stick on and do not fall off.",positive
Brother TZ tapes are the most reliable and durable label tapes we've used.  Generic ones just don't cut it.1/2-inch is our most used size.,positive
"I was expecting this tape to be as sharp and precise as the black on white tape. That is not the case. Although it is ok it is not wonderful, the edges look a bit fuzzy, not nearly as sharp as the other tapes I used. The black on clear is wonderful... but not the white on clear. Somewhat disappointing.",neutral
I ordered both black and red colors.The red does not look good at all;stick to black.  This is a matter ofpersonal aesthetics.Nothing is wrong with the product.Pick your color carefully.,positive
If you're looking for durable labels that work with a Brother printer these are the labels for you. I use them in an industrial setting and they hold up very well to grease and coolants.,positive
"tape is fine, still much waste with the way the printer works unless one does 'continuous' printing.",positive
We've always had great quaity w/ brother P-Touch labels (knock on wood).  The 1 inch size allows us to either print very large or  lines (3-4 I think) of smaller print.  The white labels stand out well.,positive
I was looking for this size to wrap around some antenna cable of IDing.  Works great!  I would suggest this product.,positive
It's a replacement tape cartridge for a label printer. Not much else to say.,positive
This color combination was hard to find - but this was a great price for TZ tape!  So much cheaper then at Staples - it looks great too!  Has a slight silver/grey color verses pure white though.,positive
Brother TZ tapes are the most reliable label tapes I've used.  Generic ones just don't cut it.1/2-inch is our most used size.,positive
I was looking for replacement tape for my Brother P-Touch label maker. These are good quality and at a wonderful price.,positive
"lots of power, easy to hack/tweak.I will never put it in my camera hot shoe anyway, I use them with remotes (Cactus V4 to be specific)",positive
"I bought the 285 based on an endorsement by the authors of a book on flash photography. Big mistake. First, the flash head is so big you'll find a hard time finding diffusers that will fit it. Second, the instruction manual is almost useless. Next making adjustment to power is needlessly cumbersome, and finally the recycle time is almost 10 seconds!  I bought a Yongnuo and found it superior in every way.",negative
"Can't beat it for the money.  There's a little learning curve with the manual settings, but my results with it have been outstanding.  It's very much worth the upgrade over your built in flash.",positive
"Great performance and features that make shooting manual much easier.  Thanks for keeping this classic in production.  I'll take anothr, please.  :-)",positive
I've had this flash about a month now. I've been pretty happy with it and it does everything I need to do with an off camera flash. Great price.,positive
"Overall a really good flash for beginners and experienced photographers alike. If you're used to an automatic flash this may not be the best option for you, as everything is controlled by the user. However, if you would like to learn more about flash photography (especially off-camera lighting), you can't beat the value of this unit.",positive
Works great. Good buy. Found it with you at a great price. I would recommend it to others who have the need.,positive
"I could only give this Vivitar four stars because it does everything very well, but it takes a LOT of practice to learn how to use it WELL! Once one learns how to use it, it is a really useful all-round flash and a good addition to a multi-flash system. Considering the price, well worth it.",positive
"It really would be nice if they specified which camera's these work with, because this flash does not work with Pentax K-7.  The manual itself is as confusing as trying to read it in spanish.  Tried calling Pentax customer service and ended up with Indian Customer Non-Service.  I'll buy American next time.",negative
The Vivtar 285 HV is simple the best flash ever made. If your looking for a powerful flash this is the one to own.,positive
"This is a great flash for those who do not want or have upwards of $300 to spend on a eTTL flash or something of the sort. This is my second 285 as I blew the circuit on the first one using the AF finder on my DSLR. It's kind of bulky, and is hard to find accessories (diffusers, gels, etc), but otherwise a great product.",positive
"This is a well balanced product (cost/quality)I had purchased one before and I drooped it and dosen`t work... I mean It's a delicated product but If you take care of it, you will have a good flash to count with.This last flash I ordered was on time and in perfect conditions, so I can recomend it :)",positive
"Excellent as a backup flash. You must be aware that it is hard to have anyone honor the warranty since apparently Vivitar is no longer in business. If that concerns you, go with the real McCoy and get a brand name flash.",positive
"I took more than 100 pics using it during my vacations. It's excellent but i confess it took me some time to learn how to use it properly with my camera. At the end, I realized it was better to use in M position ISO 200 than with A, S or P modes. I'm glad to have bought it!",positive
I purchased this strobe to use on my Nikon D80.  Works great on or off camera.  I especially like being able to adjust the power which some of the less expensive models aren't able to do.  Very happy with the quality for the price.,positive
Vivitar 285HV Auto Professional FlashThis is an amazing inexpensive flash that rivals OEM dedicated equipment.Yet it is not ETTL but just because of that it gives you a full control over what you are doing. I really like it ( as well as uncounted number of photographers in the last 30 years). I only wish it came with a power adapter.,positive
Excellent manual flash. I own few of these units and they work perfectly with Yongnuo RF-603n transceivers. Very happy with the performance and build quality.,positive
"Absolutely phenomenal quality and performances.A must have for all serious strobists out there.The sensor works very well, awesome alternative to TTL.The bouce is sublime and the recharge timing is simply ""faster that you can shoot"".I am using it with my Canon: 5D Mark II, 1Ds Mark II and 1D Mark IV",positive
"One of the best flashes ever made, powerful and professional.  These have been unchanged for decades for a reason, powerful and consistent exposures with this fantastic flash.I still use mine 15 years later with my new Nikon DSLR cameras.  The best.",positive
"My Dad gifted me a Vivitar 285HV 15 years ago when I was learning photography. Its still the only flash I own. Its a powerful flash with accurate exposure using the coloured ""auto"" modes. There are you tube videos on how to use this - it only takes 10 mins to figure out how to use it. Only cons are that its a little big and noisy.",positive
"Great film at a great price.Digital is fast,but picture quality is better on film.(my opinion)",positive
worked great. Expiration date was not an issue. Completely satisfied.Picture quality was similar to the Kodak product available locally instores.,positive
"As I have mentioned in other reviews of Fuji film products, this one is no exception.  The ISO 200 is an excellent medium for generating some fine color prints.  I highly recommend this company and the film offerings they have.Their pricing is more than fair and processing does not take very long.  If you like film photography as I do, and have not tried Fuji products, I highly recommend firing off a test roll.  Thanks for reading.Tony",positive
"Who uses film these days, right? Fugi film is clearly the best. Everyone knows that! Love the product, takes photos like a dream.",positive
"I used these film to test my newly acquired vintage camera, and I was satisfied for the result.  The color is okay, as the Fuji films are noted for superb color.",neutral
"have used this film many many times color quality is GOOD and always available used with two different types of 35mm caneras ae1 canon , minolta",positive
"Same great stuff I used to get in japan when shooting film. Fine grain, great color, and really forgiving. Ordered it along with a Canon Film rebel on here.Edit: I too received generic Fuji instead of the HQ, nonetheless still great film just a heads up. Not near to expiration like some people said they got. Mines good till 2014/03",positive
"The film is excellent becuase it is Fuji Film,however, the company is promoting the film as Super HQ Speed and it is not. It is regular 200 speed film when it arrives. I was given a full refund and was told to keep the product.",positive
Thought I was buying a higher grade of Fuji but it is plain. Still Fuji is good and you can't buy it across the counter anymore so I am just glad to have it.,positive
Gave it to someone who asked for it.  They used it and it worked fine.  But they really need to get a digital camera.  Too hard to come by and these films are expiring quickly.,positive
it was a 3 pack with a roll...not as it was featured on the pic...i just hope that rolls of film are in good condition.,neutral
"I have always been pleased with Fuji film, because of its emphasis on the blues, greens, and darker hues I find more pleasing that Kodak's. With my Canon T2, I get the best results from FujiFilm, and I can't wait to try the 200 and 800 speed!I am very pleased with my purchase, the speed of the shipment, and the price!",positive
"As A Professional Audio Engineer, And An Amateur Photographer, I Take Many Pictures At Concerts...Kodak Is Good, But Never Comes Out Very Colourful, And The Generics Just Plain Suck...Fuji Film Really Brings Out All The Coloured Lights...The Oversaturation Of Colour Is Great, But Sometimes Unwanted...Agfa Is Good All Around Film, With Excellent Sharpness, But Tends To Be Expensive...Fuji Film Rules...",positive
"They work great! And I totally recommend this product, they were a bargain and I have gotten great quality pictures with these.",positive
This is some really good basic film. The colors are good and the price is nice too. I use these a lot because they are affordable and the results always come out pretty good.,positive
nice nice nice.  For a fast film this has good color and seems to be forgiving on the exposure.  We use it for karate picts where we don't want the flash.  Since costco still develops and puts on DVD using this is not expensive and makes the kids think before they snap a picture.,positive
"I love to shoot this film indoors with my SMC Pentax-M 50mm f/1.4 lens on one of my Pentax bodies for available-light shots. The colors are good and the grain is minimal. My go-to film is Fujicolor 200 because it can be had so inexpensively, but when I need a couple extra stops I reach for this Superia X-tra 800 every time.",positive
Very grainy on outdoor shots.Good quality indoors.  Good colors on indoor.  Colors ran outdoorsI would recommend for indoor,neutral
"I used this product before, and it was OK, but on the last purchase I had a bad experience with the film, it came out in weird colors. I like Fuji, I think that was a rare case of failed quality control.",neutral
I suspect the last pack I bought was in a container that got x-rayed.  Lost some great photos. Bye bye.,positive
Fun film. Great colors and really like the ASA400 speed.,positive
"I got 3 loose rolls of film, not as pictured in orginal Fuji wrapping.Without original wrapping I cannot tell the film's experation date.",negative
"I'm not sure if you can still purchase APS cameras, but if you have one film is hard to come by. They don't even sell it at the drug stores. If you use it I would say stock up no because with reduced demand and the fall of Kodak it could suffer the same fate as betamax.",positive
I love my old Advantix Kodak camera and I was very pleased to even be able to find some film...It takes nice pictures...Even though I normally use my digital I still like old fashioned film and this fills the bill...,positive
"Have digital camera now, but still wish I had a regular camera with the film and negatives to go thru and printed out.",positive
"If you need great amateur photo shots (vacation) while snorkeling, these are the affordable cameras to use. Give good close up photos up to 25 feet.",positive
"While my grandchildren haven't used them yet, because they are disappointed that they are not digital, I know that will enjoy the picture that take later this week when I kind of force them to use them while swimming.  They really don't appreciate that they are waterproof.",positive
"I've used these cameras before, and they take great pictures if you have a steady hand. When I saw the price of $28 for a four-pack...well, I can't beat that locally.",positive
"what else can you say. it's the same disposable super-wide-angle-lens, 800 ISO cameras you used for years before digital cameras, but waterproof.",positive
We purchased these for our gift bags for a wedding because we were going on a Caribbean Cruise. Everyone loved them.,positive
"this camera was a blast to use on the cruise, at the beach and at the waterpark amongst the kiddos.  highly recommend!",positive
"This is the worst underwater disposable I've ever used. Out of 27 shots only 5 even developed, and those were so dark you could only see blurs.$10 for the camera and $10 for developing, a complete waste.",negative
Took it to Costa Rica for the waterfalls and what not. Took a few cool pictures and most of them developed with no problems. With the exception of 1 or 2 pictures. But I think it was the person using it that messed them up.,positive
"Bought this for my Grand-daughter who went to Florida, and she took it on her water skidoo, it got wet and still took great pics..would buy again.",positive
"brought this to make a basket to raffle off, looks like fun. can't wait to see their face when they win",positive
If you are needing a waterproof camera and want to get it for a great price. I strongly recommend purchasing this 4 pack.,positive
"No leak issues and all 4 cameras worked well. The developed film largely came out well but a couple were unintelligible. The cameras were purchased for our trip to the Bahamas. The strap is like a rubber band and winding and snapping pictures is a breeze. Next underwater trip I take, I will be purchasing more of these.",positive
"The rubber band is apparently a handle.  I inadvertently tossed it out when I opened it to look at it.  Then the next day I saw the hole on the side and thought  &#34;Oh, that is a bracelet handle. Duh&#34;",positive
"I tried in my sunny garden to baseline the quality and it did not come out good.  Comparable to CVS pharmacy disposable 35mm.  It went downhill from there:  The underwater pictures were not worth it.  Out of all the pictures, there was only one of my dog splashing into the pool that is kinda keeper.  But, it's 6 bucks.  So, c'mon, experiment with it.  If you don't like it after that, you're out 15 - 20 bucks after developing.",negative
it was very good. took alot of pixs @ the Beach & resorts & didn't have to worry about it getting wet.,positive
"I believe the camera takes 30 shots.  We got &#34;money shots&#34; of the boys feeding NURSE SHARKS.  Follow the directions, and you can have good quality photos.  No pictures below 5 feet of water.  No full sun pictures.  There is no stress in giving a 5 year-old a $10.00 camera.  It is a little hard to wind the film knob.",neutral
"This product is cheap and you get cheap pictures.  My wife and I used these cameras to take underwater pictures of sharks.  They came out a bit grainy, but you can still make out the shark details.  I was overall ok with the camera because you get what you pay for.  I was expecting high def pictures and I didn't get them.",positive
"We got some great underwater pictures of tropical fish using this this...simple to shoot, focus and use....VERY reliable and sturdy; highly recommend for casual/un-complicated vacation use",positive
"I bought this for my first snorkeling trip.  I didn't take many pictures and my foggy snorkel mask made it a bit difficult, but I did get a few very clear good shots.I would buy this again if I went snorkeling.Conditions: mid-afternoon, sunny, coral reefs in Bermuda water too deep to stand but not that deep (reefs sometimes pretty much at eye level)",positive
"Camera is a bit bigger than most disposables because of the plastic outercase.  Avoid any lotion getting on the lens area because it will become foggy instantly.  Pictures are grainy for sure, but ok if there is enough light on the underwater reef and fish.  Colors are more bright than Kodak camera.",neutral
We took three of these to the west indies so my daughter could complete a science assignment. One worked well - one seemed to work - until I had them developed and discovered that the film had broken and no pictures were taken. I still have the third .. anyone want to take a chance?,negative
"If you buy this, make sure you familiarize yourself with the lever for advancing the film -- you don't want to figure it out while snorkeling. After a few shots, the lever just spun uselessly. I have no idea how many shots I got -- I've been reluctant to waste money on developing.",negative
"We brought two of these to the Galapagos, and neither worked - the film advance failed us almost immediately.  We would not recommend these cameras!",negative
The poor quality photographs that this camera takes will make you erase those memories even from your mind. It is better to just remember those moments and leave this camera in store. Buy bubble gum instead.,negative
I took this to hawaii. went snorkeling and got pretty good pics. I had to get used to winding it after every picture as its a 35mm camera but it held up great under water. I really didnt expect proffesional quality pix. They were not as clear as digital. totally worth the 5.99 I paid for it. (I uploaded some of my pics)you see and can decide if its the camera for you! :),positive
works great esp for vacations.  I have 2 left and i know this is going to be perfect for my next trip! thanks!,positive
I had used these before and needed one for a quick scuba trip.  I don't know if this one was just bad or what - but it leaked ruining the camera and all of the film.  I most likely wont be purchasing these again,negative
This film may work fine for under water or dark situations (is is 800 speed after all) but results from normal daylight photos are very poor. I wouldn't even say photos were were better than nothing. Save your money.,negative
"The case was cracked and I did not notice it until I was in the water snorkeling.  Possibly it is a good camera, but should have inspected when delivered.",negative
If you're taking pictures in a swimming pool underwater while perfectly still. It should work for you. I bought the pack of 4 for Cancun mexico while I was underwater taking picture of fish. about 90% of all the pictures were absolute TRASH! The fish were all blurs almost unable to see any fish at all. Complete waste of time and money. I took pictures of my girlfriend underwater and she is a blur also.,negative
"Just as described, great disposable cameras for our trucking fleet.",positive
"I let the kids use them in the pool or take them when we go to water parks as I have water logged cameras in the past. Have not yet taken them in to get pictures done yet, its funny to be saying that in this digital age  =)",positive
My daughter took it to Australia this summer to capture the great barrier reef. It didn't come out well. Blurry and about 3/4 of the pics were black and unable to print. So I would not buy again. Disappointing!:(,negative
"I have written a review on these tapes before I think.  TDK is a find standard VHS tape.  I think once in about 15 years I had one that didn't work properly.  I use and reuse, and recordings I made years ago are still fine,",positive
The tapes are amazing. They came earlier than I thought they would. I have watched the tapes and the condition is perfect. I'm so glad I bought these tapes. I will buy again.,positive
"These tapes work. No problems with jamming in the VCR.  I bought Sony first, and I was surprised that they all were jamming up in two of my VCR.  After 5 of the Sony tapes jammed, I threw them all away. I have been using the TDK tapes for a while - no problems.  Would buy again.  Quick shipping.",positive
"There are still those of us who use our VCR's instead of Tivo for simple recording because of the monthly cost.  VCR tapes are all but impossible to find locally so I was thrilled to find good quality tapes here at a decent price.  So far, they have produced good quality recordings and I have been able to reuse them without issue.  I plan to stock up on more very soon!",positive
These are an excellent value. I have ordered this pack previously as well. The most recent shipment could have been packed a little better but the tapes were in good shape. Service and value are excellent.,positive
A good buy. I really hate the way Amazon has a demand on how many I should use to review a product - What a bunch of horse pucky!!!,positive
What can you say about a tape. They are going the way of the dodo bird but I still use them until I can no longer find them.They work for me.,positive
"These tapes are getting harder and harder to find!  This was an excellent purchase, price very good, shipping very reasonable, shipped very fast.  Great purchase if you are in need of the good, old fashioned recording systems!",positive
"They work beautifully and I've been able to re-use them several times w/o problems.  Tape-overs come out great until you've used them maybe 8-10 times then they might be grainy if you haven't kept your heads clean.  Otherwise, super product.",positive
"im a record tv addict, i buy these often. great 4 movies too. if you want to tape & get worth 4 your dollar, get these!",positive
I have been using TDK for a long time and rate them at the top of the blank tape heap. Great buy!,positive
"Fits my Canon A-620 PERFECTLY. Has space for 4 extra AA batteries. Separate storage for extra SD cards. And very well padded. On top of all that, it's weather resistant, too. For the price, I can't imagine finding a camera bag better than this one.",positive
"Great bag.  It does fit the A20 and an extra Compact Flash card perfectly.  However, it is a bit tight when trying to fit 4 'AA' batteries but it is acceptable.  The quality of the bag is top notch and the fabric inside the bag won't scratch the lcd screen.  The hidden cover is a bonus!",positive
My D40 fits fine in this case it is a great case that keeps the camera safe and well taken care of.,positive
"Bag is just the size I was hoping for and currently does what it's supposed to...hold a camera(small dslr) + 1 lens, although my lens is just the basic 18-55 lens. Great price+free shipping! Would recommend.",positive
"This is a fine nylon camera bag.  It fits the Fuji HS10 (and HS20) just right, with a small amount of looseness.  The pocket in front has room for all the extras.  The HS10/HS20 is bigger than the S2000, S1500, and S1800 cameras, and so needs a slightly bigger bag. This bag also comes with a belt loop.",positive
I like the bag overall. It's a simple little padded bag to carry your camera in. There is no room much of anything besides the camera but it works great.,positive
"Needed a simple but quality bag for a FujiFilm FinePix S700, and this worked perfectly.  Fit the camera like a glove and is still in use today with the same camera.",positive
Fit's the Canon T2i no problem. Pouch under the lid will hold memory cards and the small extras. Outside pouch is very roomy. Strap is a little stiff but I think it will work in over time. The low price makes this an excellent buy.,positive
"I couldn't use it (D80 + 18-200mm VR), but it's pretty effective and minimalist, as I'd like, and would be ideal with some of the kit lenses on a Nikon D40/50/80.",positive
This bag holds my nikon FM3a with a Tamaron 24-135 zoom perfectly. There is just enough room left inside that I can squish my neck strap in there too. I've also found that the outside pocket has room to hold three film canisters. This bag is great if you want to fling your camera over your shoulder for a quick walk to the park or a trip to a ball game.,positive
This is a perfect fit for a Nikon D40 w/ an 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens.  Even has enough room to tuck in the camera's strap.,positive
"I was able to fit the Canon XSI in this camera with not problem as long as I did not included the shower strap. The front pocket is big enough to fit the 270 EX flash. Looks, it looks very good and low key. Construction is great, very well built and perfect size for me.",positive
"Fits Ok, but still a bit small for the Nikon D5000 w/ kit lens, can use a little some extra space.",positive
Bought this for Nikon D40 and its a perfect fit. Comfortably holds the D40 and its kits lens with the Nikon strap inside. Holds the SD card in the inside pouch and the spare battery in the outside pouch.Cant hold the charger and its cord though. But with a spare battery and with Nikon's efficiency you dont have to charge quite often so its not a great minus.,positive
"I bought this product for two reasons: first, I think it have a good design because it bag opens in form that you can hold the camera safety all the time and second, this bag fits like a glove with my camera Nikon D3000 with it's 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens attached.",positive
"Very good camera bag, my canon xsi feets perfectly. Maybe it should have more pockets. But its very good for tourist traveling.",positive
"This is a well designed minimalist type case that I would love to use except that It doesn't quite fit my Nikon D80 with my favorite lens the 18-200 AF VR lens. It would work with any of the stock 18-55 or shorter lenses. The D40 works fine in this case too. It's well made, too bad it isn't a couple of inches longer!",positive
"If you only need to carry around your digital slr camera with one lens and no accessories, this bag will do, but you still have to be careful cause it doesn't provide any protection against falling.",neutral
"I own one each of the TLZ mini, TLZ 1, and TLZ 2. They are great walk-around bags. The mini is perfect for my Nikon D40 with the attached kit lens and a lens pen. I expect it would work well with any similar small DSLR and lens combo.",positive
"Nicely padded, room for a couple filters and extra film.  Compact and great for carrying.  Caution!  Leave it zipped, because if you pick up this bag opened your camera will fall out.",positive
i bought a canon xti about a year ago and needed a new bag to carry it in. this bag holds the camera great and the straps fit well.,positive
"Needed a good carry bag for my Nikon D40 that i purchased recently.I use it mostly with the kit lens 18-55 mm which fits snugly into this lowerpro bag.Strap & the carry case is made of durable material, and i am satisfied with the purchase.Just be sure that your DSLR is not too big for this, this case should fit most medium sized dsl'rs with kit lenses;Also has front zip pouch to keep battery/sd card etc.",positive
"This bag perfectly fits my canon rebel xti + kit lens, with room for a battery charger, a usb cable, a screen cleaner, some extra memory cards, etc--everything I need aside from my other lenses. There are two pockets--one outside and one inside the flap. It's portable but durable, with enough padding to protect its contents.",positive
"I love this bag, it is the perfect for the Nikon D40 with either the 18-55 or the 55-200mm lens.  You can't fit both lens in it of course, that's not what it's for.  I also have the Nikon strap attached do my D40 and it easily fits inside this topload zoom mini bag.  I don't know what other people mean by this bag is too small, it's the perfect size.",positive
Strong...Samll...and a few pockets....nice.I have a Nikon D200 and 18-200mm lensThe bag works great,positive
"After reading the reviews, I thought this bag would be bigger than it actually is. It really only has room for the camera with attached lens and a pocket for a few extras such as filters or cards. I would prefer a bag that can hold an extra lens, but the conical shape prevents that.",neutral
"This bag is nice, it can easily fit my D300 with vertical grip attached. I like it and just like any lowepro product the build quality is A-1.....highly recommended.",positive
"great bag, lives up to lowepro's rep but simply too small for a d300 w/grip. the camera with no grip and a 30mm prime just barely fit. no way would it take a longer zoom. adding insult to injury, no room for a flash in the acc. pocket. mine is going back. would be a great solution for someone with a smaller camera, though.",positive
"I often go for long walks around town with my Nikon D40 camera with 18-200 zoom lens attached.  This bag protects the camera and has enough pocket space for everything I need:  filters, extra battery and memory card, etc.  The bag is lightweight and low-bulk so it is comfortable to carry for miles at a time.",positive
"i finally broke down late last year and purchased the DSLR camera i have wanted for years, but couldn't carry it with me on my motorcyle until i found this camera bag. it has plenty of depth to protect the lense, and room at the top for a good quality camera strap.  it fits easily in my motorcycle saddle-bags, so i can carry it on road trips when i plan one.  good product, well worth the price.",positive
"I love this bag, its just perfect fit for my Kodak Z980. i put my P20 flash in the bottom, together with the charger and the reserve batterey in it. Also you can adjust the postition for the camera (the velcro inside). The price, couldn't beat it!love it, love it, love it",positive
"I bought this for traveling with a D300s and 17-55 2.8 attached.They fit perfectly, and there is even a couple pockets for other goodies.When I travel, I don't like having my camera out, so this case keeps it hidden and safe. When I need to take a shot, it is quick and easy to get the camera out.The D700 fits as well.Highly Recommended.",positive
I have a D40 and this bag is perfect for it and few extra items...worth the price...the texture of the bag is soft and not that hard core material.,positive
"Make sure your lens is under 5.5"" otherwise there might be a good chance that it won't fit.Other than that it is an excellent bag.",positive
"My SONY A100 camera with 70-210mm lens fit into this bag easily.  This camera bag is smaller enough so you can carry another bag with additional lens together.  I do not want people look at me as News person, so the plain look is OK for me.",positive
"good in all respects for a rebel - sized DSLR w/extra lens BUT (only one review mentions this) there are no pockets whatsoever.So SD/CF cards, lens tissue, whatever, must find a place elsewhere (eg, an outboard lens case).  This is a shame as it would have been so easy to include a zippered top or front pocket.  other than than, it's fine.",positive
Excellent day bag for my Nikon D70 w/ 70mm lens. I use the side lens carriers for extra batteries and CF cards. The bag is comfortable to wear and not very bulky.,positive
"This can hold everything you need for a day hike... camera, water bottle, snacks... Or multiple lenses if you like. Comfortable to wear on the front or the back.",positive
"I purchased this bag based on the reviews and was concerned whether it could/would handle my Canon Rebel XT with a Tamron 28-300mm lens.  The camera, with lens attached fit fine and the side compartments can hold my 18-55mm lens and camera accessories.  The unit is compact and light.  It serves the user well when taking a weekend trip or going on a hike as it frees up your hands while protecting the camera and lens.",positive
this would be great for entry level slr with shorter lenses - doesnt fit my canon 40d with any of the zoom lenses - must return it.,negative
"This is the first photo backpack I've ever had, and I'm impressed.  The quality is obvious.  It holds as much as I think I'd care to have on my back, and you can configure the dividers as you wish - it's very versatile.  No regrets on this.",positive
This case is awesome.  It's very well padded to protect my husband's camera and has plenty of pockets for all of his accessories.,positive
"This compact tripod fufills all my needs, except for table top usage.  It's a well made product that sets-up and folds-up for storage quick usage or storage.  All of this at a really low price.",positive
Weighs in at only 1kg. Nice quality construction.  Infinitely adjustable leg length.  I combined with with a Gorillapod with ball-head and bubble level. The ball-head is transferrable so I can use it on this Velbon as well.,positive
"I have an LG projector, that I also purchased through Amazon, permanently attached to this tripod.  It is the perfect setup that allows me to go mobile with my projector, and keeps me from needing to mount it in my home.  Quality construction.",positive
"Very solid construction.Works 100%.Looks great.When not in use, works as a techno-sculpture on top of a bookcase  :)Absolutely recommend it!",positive
"I got this for doing macro shots close to the ground. There are better ways to do this, but this is a lot cheaper than a bigger tripod that can get down low. It's also a nice travel tripod - it's light and small.On the downside, it's pretty much plastic. And heavier SLRs are at it's limit. But - for the price and the fact that it doesn't pretend to be more, it does the job.",positive
"Works as advertised, should be sold with a ball head mount, but that is not required.  Does assist in keeping the camera steady in lower lighting situations, and makes for a great walking stick also as it don't fit in my camera bag at all.",positive
"Before I found this Velbon, I bought a Manfrotto tripod kit for almost 3x the cost.  I wish I had found this tripod first. This Velbon is every bit as smooth and sturdy as the Manfrotto.  I mean it is really smooth, both up and down and side-to-side.Bobby T.",positive
I looked around and after reading the reviews i picked this up and was not disappointed.The fluid head is very smooth for pans and tilts. A surprise feature was the quick release which locks open when the plate is removed so all you have to do is slide the plate back in and it snaps locked.The only concern i have is that is made up of a lot of plastic but hey for the price what do you expect.,positive
I am a professional wedding videographer and this is always my go-to tripod. It's light enough to easily carry around but large and sturdy enough to get the job done. They're also priced affordably so I always have at least two of these.,positive
The friction HEAD is not the greatest but this tripod works fine for a pro traveling for a light job,positive
This is a well made economical tripod.  While best suited to a video camera it worked well for my DSLR as well.,positive
"The Velbon 607/F is a pretty nice tripod, especially for the money. I have been using it for a few months and really like it. The panning is smooth and the quick release platform is really nice.Pros:- smooth panning- quick setup- comes with a carrying bag- lightweightCons:- Since its lightweight you have to hold on to it when your panning sometimes because it jerks a little bitOverall, its a great buy.",positive
"Tripod worked well and seemed sturdy. However, after six months (about 5 uses), an internal plastic part broke on a leg clamp. Now it is non-functional.Off to the company website: After two layers of company's deep (Velbon, and HakubaUSA), I find a service page. Email using the provided link. Bounces: 'Mailbox Full'. Try to call: ""We're sorry, we are unable to take your call."". Hmmmm. This one may be heading to the dumpster after just five uses.",neutral
I bought Velbon years ago and loved the smoothness of the panning and tilt. I have tested  others in the store and they all were very jerky to pan and tilt. I recently bought another Velbon and after all these years the smoothness in Velbon has not changed. I love it and the carrying case.,positive
"Relatively lightweight, solid for its weight, and has wonderfully smooth pans. I've had it only a week and am already wondering how I did without it. The fluid pan head makes a HUGE difference in following the action while zoomed - good-bye to herky-jerky videos at last! The carry case makes it a lot more portable than I expected. I upgraded from a tripod that cost 1/3 as much, and it's well worth the extra. Highly recommended.",positive
"This is a video tripod, but I've used it with relative success with my DSLR.  The product works exactly as advertised, it's lightweight yet durable, and it's held up to at least a year of being luggesd around to various events.  This isn't professional quality by any means, but it's a great entry level tripod for video cameras.",positive
"If you are on a budget and we ALL are this is your tripod!  this is my go to guy for my T2i when I am filming, all i can say is i am Impressed!",positive
"I bought this for my spouse.Says, it's ""good, very good"".Good enough for me then.I thought it was a good value.",positive
they do not make this anymore. i loved this case a lot. i still buy a lot of c-ds so i still need them. i have to find other ways to store my c-ds.,positive
This hard to find product was exactly what I was looking for. Amazon really does have everything!,positive
"Would buy again.  Storage for the jewel cases/CDs aren't the easiest thing to find.  I like this.  Nice product.  Hard plastic frame inside, tough but thin exterior.  Happy.",positive
I have bought ten of these cases for my CD collection. Consistent quality and a must for packing away your music. Zippers are solid and the case is easily stacked or lined up on a shelf.,positive
I really found this particular product great use for my CD collection and would highly recommend. If a person looking for ideal CD carry case this would be the one. Well made for on the go carrying without the hassle.,positive
These cable ties do the job.. would purchase more in the future if needed. Use it for every day work since I am a mobile worker and carry all sorts of cables to different client sites.,positive
"I was attracted to the colors and I bought them. However, since  the hook part of the cable tie is very small, it does not give me the same flexibility that the cable ties that I bought at Walmart do. And they are all the same size, unlike what is shown in  the picture.",negative
These hold the cables but they are a pain to roll and unroll...once rolled up the want to keep that formso you have to keep trying to stretch them out from the rolled up form when you try to use them again.,neutral
"They use velcro and work well. They are bigger than I expected, but looking again at the pic, it does show them on huge cords.",positive
Much less hassle than cable ties. Can reuse many times have found different uses for. Thinking of buying more to have on hand.,positive
Great quality. The variety of colors makes it easier to distinguish cords. I use these for separating cords within a photobooth.,positive
"I use these cable ties to make my workspace neater, make our cables for our networking equipment,  and also to make the cables in our entertainment center neater, and they work well, and best of all, are reusable, so if I need to add or remove a cable, it's as easy as undoing a few cable ties.",positive
"Having been a trade show manager for a large electronics company, I saw that the technicians always wrapped their cables in a circle and tied them with velcro straps like above.  Get some.",positive
cleaned up the area--no more tangled wires to look at--can use anywhere--always keep handy even when traveling-will buy again.  love them,positive
IF YOU CAVE A LOT ELECTRONIC WIRES HANGING ALL OVER HOUSE THIS IS GREAT WAY TO TIE UP YOUR CORDS AND ORGANIZE THEM FOR EASY TROUBLE SHOOTING,positive
They are good wire ties.  A little long and need to be trimmed for most applications or you are wrapping a wire bundle multiple times but better too long than too short.,positive
"Yes, I would recommend this product does what is says it is going to do ..looks good and works.....try them you will be happy...",positive
"I use these on my smaller cords such as my laptop power cables, iPod and iPhone charger cables, USB cables and the like. They're long enough to hold a 1-1 1/2"" bundle and the tab ends allows you to each tear them open when you need to. The color coding helps to identify what the cables are. If the ties is too long its easy to cut to the right length.",positive
"These little gems do the job great.  Since I got a new all in one desktop with no CPU on the floor, there are a few more wires showing on the desk.  This solved my neatnik wife's complaints of the wire mess.",positive
These are what you'd expect from velcro cable ties but I prefer these to the velcro brand version.  They have tags that allow the tie to be easily removed and do not attach throughout the cable but only on a small section near the end of the cable.  This allows you to more easily wrap a cable and hold it tighter then the velcro brand straps.  Definitely recommend!,positive
"They work, but, the strip only has the second side of Velcro on the end, so you have to wrap the entire thing around the cords before it secures. When the cords aren't all that thick then the tie is loose and doesn't really hold the wires all that well. I should have just spent the money on a roll of tape.",neutral
"These are perfect for my needs; wrapping a few cables.  Strips are about 1/2&#34; thick and about 6&#34;-7&#34; long.  Great price, quick shipping.",positive
I purchased these to clean up the maze of cables associated with my computer and auxiliary gear. They work very well. I find that these are superior to the &#34;Ut Wire 5-Inch Flexi Ties Cable Wrap&#34; (which I also purchased on Amazon). I recommend these self-attaching ties.,positive
"Unlike other velcro sleeves, these do not have the option of attaching to the cable, which makes it inconvenient if you want to use it in a situation where you want to take it off and on frequently.",neutral
Why didn't I think of this? I used tie wraps then when I moved the computer I cut the tie wraps and redid them. Now I can add / remove the velcro ties easy! then use them again..............really a good idea to make life easier!,positive
"Cables are always a hassle. Laptop power cord (actually 2 cables), phone charger cable, even that rats nest behind the computer, these keep things neat and tidy.",positive
"My only worry when I bought these was that they would not be effective for only attaching a few cables at a time, but these work for cables of all widths. One of mine has 7 or 8 and one of the other has only 2 or 3.",positive
its all right for the price but like the flexi ties cable wrap better than this. this isnt that neat a purchase. it works and does the job but doesnt keep em together all the time.,positive
The picture and description of the product come up short. There is a use for theses just not for me. Regular Velcro ties are more functional than these. Colors fancy smancy and no big deal for my needs.,neutral
These ties are very useful for clearing clumsy wires around your computer or Home Theatre. I am using with Computer wires,positive
"These work but they're very expensive and can't be &#34;permanently&#34; attached to the cable for future unwrapping and rewrapping.I've converted to Velcro Reusable Self-Gripping Cable Ties and find that giving up color for many, many more slightly better designed ties was a good move.",negative
These color coded tags help identify the connection to and from a device if you use many pieces of equipment.  A bag of six is just enough for the basic home user.  It uses velcro fasteners.  Length can be cut it fit. No place to write any names or purpose.  Color identification only.,neutral
"These are a better way of securing cables than using a wire twister, The different colours can be used to identify cables and are reusable. Would like to see pacs of various sizes.",positive
I have been buy Case Logic products for years. My DVD and CD inventory has increcsed so I needed more cases and pages too.  Great product would recommend.,positive
"Ok - I only get 5 pages for $11.99.  My DVB80 came with 20 pages to start with  - and the album for $29.99.  So - if I wanted 20 pages to use in my many albums - then it would cost me  $47.96 (4 x $11.99 refill cost)!!!!I could purchase 2 NEW DVB80 albums for $59.98, get 40 refill pages and get 2 binders to use for other purposes!!!Does Case Logic think it's customers are idiots???",negative
"They are indistinguishable from the ones that were in the binder from the factory.  These extra pages pushed the binder to the limit of what it could hold, there's no way I could put another package of sleeves into the one I used these on.It's certainly a lot cheaper than buying yet another binder.",positive
"They are really nice, however, they are not what I expected. I was wanting the ones with 4 holders on each side and these only have them on one side.",positive
I had an old 3 ring binder so I bought this package to put not so often used DVD's.  Works fine,positive
"It doesn't fit my existing cases but I will find a way to use it, either a binder or a hole puncher may be the solution.",neutral
"I bought these almost 3 years ago and they were wonderful; as good as any I've ever had -- good price, too. Then the in-line volume control started messing up and I ended up throwing them away. Don't waste your money on the possibility that that the volume control won't fail.",negative
"These headphones has very good sound. They fold up well being careful.  I like them. But, I wish the quailty of the audio was  bit better.",positive
"the Camcorder Box and Spec says it is good for 1 MegaPixel photos.  It is a lie.  The image quality is like magnifying a 640 x 480 to 1 Megapixel.  The result is coarse pixelation of the photo... I called the Sony customer support and they told me, ""if it looks good on the view finder, then Sony's job is done.""  What [a lie].  Sony, wake up and don't tell lies!",neutral
"I bought one of these cameras and find it to be all that the others have said. However, I find that in the bright sunlight you have trouble seeing  the image in the LCD display. It would be of benefit to have a viewfinder,  wish it did.",positive
I have had mine for over a year now and it still works great.  It comes with a good long lasting battery the NP-FM50.My only complaint is that the included memory stick is only 4MB.  At high resolution (1600x1200) you would only be able to take about 4 pictures.  I bought a 64MB stick the very same day and have had great success.,positive
I have bought Sony radios in the past and they were great on sound. This unit; big as it is; is not that good sounding! It sounds tinny because of the thin plastic speaker enclosers. I should have bought the xplod. I am happy with everything but the sound.,neutral
"I still rate it 4 stars because of the quality of the sound, the reliability of the cassette decks and the low price. Sony has been making this same product for several years with no changes, so that means it's great, right?",positive
For its size it has good sound.  I connected it to some external speakers instead of the ones it came with and it works fine.  The included remote is a bonus although it doesn't seem to control the cassette player.,positive
"I had this stereo 3 years before I sold it. Great CD player,greatcassette recorder,and great radio. The CD player didn't skip, andthe cassette player made great recordings. Both the G500 and theZW755 are great systems, but the cassette player is better on theZW755, partly because it was a duoble deck and you could recordoff of the other deck. This is a great portable unit! Way to goSony!",positive
"This is a great case for theCanon PowerShot A470 7MP Digital Camera with 3.4x Optical Zoom (Gray). Good padding and protection. Camera fits snug and the small pocket will hold four rechargeable AA batteries. The camera only needs two at a time, so you have good backup power.",positive
"I bought this carry case for our point-and-shoot Kodak digital camera.  The quality and value are terrific.If you own a small point-and-shoot camera - seriously consider getting this bag.  Just compare the dimensions of the bag and your camera first, to make sure the camera will fit inside it.",positive
"I love the compact size of this camera bag.  It holds everything I need for those trips where I don't need my large camera bag.  The size also allows me to store this bag inside my large camera bag. I always know where it is, and it is always ready for me to grab and go.",positive
"We have had this little case for six years and it is still a very nice bag.  Durable and protective, we highly recommend it.",positive
"Well aside from what has been said, I will say the velcro part could be annoying, however it is big and secure enough to make you feel safe for the avg user who wants just a camera and nothing more professional, has extra storage for batteries and your usb cable. All in all, better then nothing and good for the value. You wont feel the need to get rid of it anytime soon.",positive
Love this product.  It's stylish and very compact.  It fits 3 rolls of film in the front compartment.  Got this for my Olympus Epic Stylus camera.You'll love this product once you have one.,positive
Excellent item that protects my digital camera well; Has nice sized external pocket to carry extra batteries (4 AA) and extra memory card. Very durable and still looks new after 2.5 years of use. Have taken it to India/Abu Dhabi & back as well as all over the US and still hold up well.,positive
"but the stitching was irregular on the front. I thought the company produced good products, but I was mistaken when I bought this item. Next time I'll just go to BestBuy for a camera case.",negative
"This is a bag for professionals!!people, this can easily fit 2 lenses, a slr body, battery charger, 2-3 cords, a few filters,even the manual and still have room for more :) and the padding aint that bad either..the build-quality is excellent and overall I would definitely recommend it if u really intend to carry a lot of stuff or else go for something smaller.Overall,a great product.",positive
Works with my Pentax *ist Ds. And you can attach it to the camera's shoulder strap.,positive
"Works excellent! Don't forget to enable remote control on camera (Fn menu on K10D and K100D bodies). Compatible with all *ist, K100D and K10D cameras. Functionally is equivalent to Pentax Remote Control F Set.",positive
"This think is as big as a USB flash drive, but is very helpful. Every Pentaxian must have it. K20D has an infra red sensors on the front and on the back of the camera, so you do not need the expensive wireless one. The camera AF works well before taking the sot! Buy it!",positive
"This is a great item considering the price, size, and functionality. Don't forget the menu setting which allows auto focus to activate just before the images is taken. If you like expanding the capability of your Pentax DSLR without buying something expensive, you will definitely get alot of fun out of this tool.",positive
"This little turntable does it all. It's advertised for TVs around 20 inches, but please note that is TUBE TVs, the old CRTs your parents have. If you use this for LCDs and plasmas, it will work up to 40-50"" TVs as long as the weight does not exceed the allowed specifications. I use it with my Westinghouse 37"" LVM-37w3 1080p monitor and never a problem!",positive
"as usual the price was good and delivery quick and I saved about $ 15 bucks from local stores .I have a 20 "" LG tv on it it fits great and swivels easy.Amazon has an amazing inventory of products its a very rare event they dont have what I want.",positive
"This was purchased for my inlaws.  They asked for this for their 32"" TV because they have many windows in their living room and it puts a glare on the TV screen at certain times of the day.  They can just easily turn the TV now to get rid of the glare.  They have thanked us many times for this turntable that they needed for years.",positive
"Using it to hold a Panasonic 54"" Plasma TV. It is very low profile, looks great and is rock solid even with a large flat panel, doesn't tip at all. Well worth the money.",positive
Does what it says it will do and does it well.,positive
"This turntable works just fine. Smooth and does exactly what I wanted, to allow me to watch my tv from either of two adjacent rooms.",positive
"This swivel does exactly what it is supposed to.  It turns easily without spinning out of control.  The spinning mechanism is large enough so that the surface is level even if the TV is forward or back.  The rubber feet virtually lock it to the underlying table.The unit is unobtrusive, low and the rounded edges give it a finished look.Highly recommended.",positive
"Decent amount of options, good lens quality, but do wish it had exposure compensation and spot metering, I've found many lighting situations where this camera could have used those features. Also wish the lens were a little wider angle so found a used Canon Z90W.",positive
"What? StuffThe Canon Sure shot is the finest of all the film compacts.  For two years, the Canon Sureshot was my mainstay.  Simple in design and function, this camera provides dependable sure shots.  The self-timer comes in handy.",positive
Very disappointed.  The pictures are focused incorrectly.  The flash is off so that half the picture gets the flash light and the other half is in a shadow.  My disposable cameras take better pictures.  I was hoping for a very simple camera that took better than disposable camera quality pictures.  Very disappointed.,negative
"Better late than never with my review I guess. You get what you pay. The price was cheap but the picture quality was very poor. Even in bright outdoor situations, the pictures were under exposed and grainy. Really disappointed with this and we ended up buying a new camera soon afterwards.",negative
"this head set works like it says it does, but it is cheply made and no good for motorcycle use.",negative
broke off headband so I could mount in motorcycle helmet. Worked well with Midland 75-822 CB. Used on 1300 bike trip,positive

"The audio connector was very difficult to make it plug into the radio jacks. Even when I got it plugged in, the microphone did not work at all.I threw it away. At least it was an inexpensive mistake.",negative
"This is a solid well built unit that I have no problems using or hearing. The only problem I have is that there is no volume control for the microphone, which seems to be an exception for most Plantronics headsets I've seen. I have to really speak up to get callers to hear me even after adjusting the microphone boom to the position that gives the highest volume.",neutral
"You'll love this thing. Nikon quality is amazing.  This lens gives a great effect to  your pics. If you photograph inside rooms, you can get the whole room in the picture, a full 180 degrees. Takse the two 180 's and combine them in your computer to 1 sphere and you have a full 360 degree room view. Awesome for real estate agents or for just having fun. Awesome potential.",positive
Sony quality and reliability. Camera used by son and family and still in use without issues. Quality photos and easy to use.,positive
"The EXP 103 is cool because it can play MP3 files.  It's not so cool because it is expensive ($), has very poor earphones that are too large to fit in my ears, does not take slight shakes very well, takes an awefully long time to recover from shakes, and has a very hard to read LCD screen.  I think it should be fairly priced at ($).",neutral
"When I first bought this product, it was a brand new concept on the market - burn your MP3s onto CDs and play them wherever you went!This product has stayed with me through extreme winters, summers, rain, humidity.  It's practically lived in my car for the last 4 years and it works like a CHAMP.I am so impressed with this, that I came back to amazon to review it.  BUY IT!",positive
J. A. Brony here.Pre-Amp from Audiosource is a great device. Works as designed. I do hear a slight tick when changing inputs but not a deal breaker.ANTONLINE was fine to deal with.JAB out,positive
