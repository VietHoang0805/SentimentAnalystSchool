I used this for my 47&#34; Samsung. Its fit/feel is great. Easy installation. Appears strong; although I personally spent way too much on the tv to risk leaving it fully outstretched with too little lag bolts for a long time! It is very convenient to be able to move it away from the wall however and I would feel very comfortable tilt or swiveling if needed. The movement is fluid and easily adjustable.I am very pleased with my purchase.,fit / feel,positive

Works great and is so much cheaper than the more expensive versions at the Big box stores. It is super easy to install yourself too. You just need a drill and a ratchet set to get it into the stud (oh yea a stud finder too).,install,positive

"Works like a charm! Lies flat on the wall when I want it too and pulls out and swivels like a charm when I need it too!The instructions call for it to be mounted into a stud in the wall, however mine is mounted directly into the drywall using heavy duty anchors and it works perfect as well! This is a great product for an amazing price!",price,positive

"For the price, this wall mount is great.  Not too hard to install.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is wire management.  I could not get the little loop to work.  Not a big deal at all however.  Overall, I highly recommend this product.  Well worth the money.",price,positive
"Needed a corner mounted Flatscreen. This did the job well, easy to install. I had to mount in a metal stud, so I used two support boards in the back to distribute the weight more evenly. Expectations of item met at a fraction of the cost from competitors.",install,positive
"Nothing fancy, just decent quality and simple installation.  As may have been mentioned, one must discard the provided Phillips screws that the manufacturer provides to affix the bracket to the wall stud.  Use your own.  The TV I mounted with it is an older flat-panel, so it's a little heavier than the news ones.  This thing isn't fazed, and stays where I put it.",installation,positive
Amazing how easy it is to move my 46&#34; around on this mount and able to hang off one stud. Nice quality feel to metal it is made of.,metal,positive

And in all those respects, I'm quite happy.However, there is a noticeable tilt/sag to the monitor when I have the arm extended.  I'm not so concerned with sag perpendicular to the wall, as that was expected, but the rotational sag that I sometimes get.",reach from the wall,positive

"Bought NEW but I could tell right away that mine had been repackaged and refurbished.  Plus the was missing the 4 arms but had some other random hardware included.

You won't be disappointed with this brand.",viewing angle,positive
"The fact that the pivot point on this TV mount was not built straight caused the TV to tilt slightly when it was swung out.  there is no adjustment for it, so i had to make a choice for the tv to either be straight and level when it was pushed against the wall, or when it was out.  i do not recommend this wall mount.to it's benefit though, it was reasonably sturdy and easy to install.",pivot point,negative

Beware. I bought this used and the person or company I bought it from didn't have the common sense to de-register it from the previous owner. That should be done before you sell it. No excuse.,-,negative
"Very good product overall.  Manipulation is somewhat clumbersome, but after use for a few hours, it is ok.  I understand that the new version (color) fixes these issues.  The display really does give the feel of paper.  Only negative is no backlighting for use in very low to no light conditions.Overall love the product.",display,positive
in my honest opinion nook is unfinished product.none of my technical books in pdf format i was able to read due to pdf reader rendering formulas all over the screen with middle-size font.i am able to see formulas in small font but then the rest of text is unreadable.formula rendering in medium font is a mess however text is readable. i would have expected developer of the device spent more time on fine-tuning the text rendering on ebook reader.,screen,negative
"I bought the color Nook for a family member for Christmas. If I didn't already have the iPad and prefer Apple products, I would have purchased one of these for myself. I think it makes a much more user friendly product than Android tablets, and the price is good. Combine a good product at a great price with an already large library available from Barnes & Noble, and you have a real competitor to the iPad and Kindle.",price,positive
I have never been a big fan of reading until I purchased the nook.  I have trouble putting it down.  I'm either playing games or reading.  Absolutely love it.,nook,positive

exactly what my daughter wanted.  she is more than tickled with this reader.  She will use it for hours and hours,reader,positive
I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE my Nook Color. One of the main reasons I'm so happy with it is because I purchased the micro SD card that turns your Nook from an e-reader into an Android tablet. It works perfectly! Now I can enjoy the Nook ebooks but also have access to all the Android apps and features.,SD,positive
"Ordered the e Reader for Christmas last year. As of today, my daughter is using it and loving it. She says, no regret she loves it.",e,positive
I have had my Nook Color for about three months now and I must say it has been one of the easiest devices to root.  This is a great bargain for $249 once you turn it into a full fledged Android tablet.  Forget about Nooky Froyo and go directly for Cyanogen mod).  You can then install the B&N Nook reader app and Amazon's own Kindle App (along with 1000's of other apps like Angry Birds).,root,positive
"Bought two of these for my daughters and they both have issues when reading books. The pages jump after a few minutes of reading and the menu screens pop up and down constantly.

While it doesn't have a light and its screen has been far surpassed by other readers throughout the years.

It charges fast and the battery lasts a decent amount of time.",charges,positive
I waited until June 2010 until I bought a nook. So far I am loving it. I love the page turning swipe feature. Those that gave the nook 1 star are the ones who got theirs with the 1.1 firmware. The firmware is now up to 1.4 and the price has dropped to $199.,nook,positive

Very good product for those with a Nook book collection. Works well with apps. All google play apps are available except for those requiring a camera.

I have a ipod touch i bought this item before i realized that my ipod already has a built in mic and so haven't used this mic and never needed it.,ipod,neutral
These work for the itouch 64gb but they sometimes skip when recording. You can not hear what you are recording. The sound quality is okay.. I did get this product fast through the mail.,sound,neutral
Wouldn't buy this again.  I never really used the product because it didnt fit the phone that well with the phone case on.,fit,negative
"I gave this five stars because for the price, this tiny microphone is excellent.  I needed a small unobtrusive mic to record university lectures to my 3rd Generation iPod Touch.  I can report that this mic works perfectly.If you need fancy cut offs, filters, or you expect concert quality results, please go elsewhere.  If you want something that works well for much less than $10, get this mic or get a couple of them.",microphone,positive
"This mic sounds surprisingly great! It picks up a wide range of frequencies very nicely! My only complaint is that it is easy to lose, but there's nothing the manufacturer could do about that.",mic,positive
"Small, compact, easy to carry around.  Followed the instructions and it worked perfectly.  It's not a broadcast quality microphone, but for everyday voice use it's a great, portable solution.",carry,positive
"Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...",built in mic,negative
This an awesome product.  It was cheap and works well.  I use it to record lectures in college so I can listen to them again.,works,positive
It works perfect. The only thing is it is so small. lol. like I think I have seriously swallowed medications larger than this device. Good item. Would recomend to anyone.,works,positive
I love this mic it works on itouch 3generation 8 gb so well. I love it too much and wat a money saver too . Nothing more to say but to order it soon!!!,money,positive
"This is a very good seller. The product arrived exactly on the estimated date of arrival. The only problem I have is that the mic has no speakers, so you need to unplug it to listen to the ipod again.",arrived,positive
useless piece of device for a device that already has a mic... the performance is very average...!!! looks smooth tho.,mic,negative
"It does not work. When you plug it in, it disables the speakers and then the iPod is practically silent. Not a good idea.",speakers,negative
I needed this for my iPod Touch and also ordered a few extras because I lose little things easily. This mic has provided much use and definitely of better quality than I was expecting it to be. I've even recommended this to a couple of friends.,quality,positive
"This item works with an I-phone 4, 4s and a Samsung Galaxy S3.  The microphone picks up sound 10 time better than the built in phone mic.  The shipping time was a little long but that is clearly stated when you purchase it.  This lets you use your phone as a digital recorder.  I will buy another one",microphone,positive
"I plugged it in and it worked. It is small, but taking it with you is a challenge. How about making it into a key chain?",plugged,positive
I don't know what I was thinking buying this piece of junk.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Invest in quality and stay away from this thing.  Seriously.,quality,negative
Nice add on for those who have an iPod Touch.  Not a miracle worker but provides microphone capability.,microphone,positive
SD Ultra Micro SDXC card has worked without flaw so far.  It's been trouble-free up to this point in transfering and managing all my audio files (~29GB) from my HP laptop to my Samsung Note 10.1 2014 Edition.  I've also purchased compatible SD micro cards for my Samsung Galaxy III cell phones which have worked out better than the Kingston cards that I had originally purchased.,SD micro cards,positive
"I bought this on March 4th, 2014. Suddenly even thought the Storage in settings showed the card with used and free space, no app could find any files on it. Had to dismount, remove it and reinsert it for it to work, BUT it is erratic! While in the middle of playing mp3s on it, all the files disappeared.. This is happening over and over. Very disappointing!",Storage,negative
"These are great, the USB port is especially handy. Small size, and all the adapters I could want. At first it seemed to light to do it's job but it is working great. It is the only adapter that I use when travelling.",USB port,positive
"This is very handy and it charges two things at once easily. I usually charge my laptop and iPod touch in this at the same time and have not had problems with it so far. It also has all of its individual parts for the various plugs it is capable of fitting in all contained within itself, which is very handy because you don't have to remember where you put the EU plug or the US plug, etc!",parts,positive
"I bought this device so I can use my laptop and charge my phone during travel to other European countries. But few hours after using it, the fuse blew up and the device didn't work after that. Very disapppointed.",fuse,negative
"The usb charger socket was totally broken and never worked. I'm not sure what the two red lights were supposed to be for but I never saw either of them turn on either. It was difficult to fit grounded US plugs in without some serious shoving, and the fakey plastic ground doesn't retract so I couldn't use it on outlets that didn't have a ground socket (common in Hong Kong). It's also quite big and heavy to travel with.",plugs,negative
"There's not much to say, other than that the price was exceptional. The adapter set is compact and appears durable. I really wanted the USB charger plug, and figured I might as well get a complete adapter set into the bargain.",price,positive
This is a cable.  It allows power to be transfered from and outside source to my Nexus 7.  It functions exactly as advertised.,power,positive
Described as a better cable than the one that came with the Tablet. Not so! Mini USB doesn't fit and cord is very short. Sending it back ASAP.,Mini USB,negative
not worth your stress...fit loosely from the get go...I have two nexus 7 tablets and it was the same with both. went to wal-mart and bought a cheap generic one and it works great.,fit,negative
"This cable is fine, except for the fact that there is no rigid construction to keep the male end from bending. I dropped my nexus 7 from a height of 1 foot onto my bed and it bent about 45. Your best bet is the official nexus 7 charger, but beware, the USB and the cable have almost entirely seperated on the cable that came with my Nexus 7.",nexus 7,negative

I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable way to store data, especially photos on the Galaxy S4.",microSD card,positive
"I bought this for my son's GoPro and it's worked out great. I just wish I would have bought the 64gb instead of going cheap on the 32gb, but so far so good. He's a couple of months into using his camera with this card and no issues.",card,positive
Purchased this after the purchase of a camcorder that required it and would not work with a 16gig. Got the smaller card at local store because of price and wanted to compare Amazon first. Haft the price of buying it local so was worth the wait. Was in my hands a few days after ordering and would recommend that one at least look here before paying the box store price.,wait,positive
This card is very good. I use it in my Gopro because that need a fast writing and reading. I recommend it.,card,positive
"I needed a class 10 card for my GOPRO and this one looked like the best deal for the size ,and I have always liked the Sandisk brand .",size,positive

This card works well with my GoPro. Lots of storage space in a small package. The price was fair for a SanDisk product.,storage space,positive
Bought this for my new Gopro and away we go. Great SD card at a great price...love it love it love it.,SD card,positive
I liked it. I is already formatted and no need for formatting it. My galaxy s4 recognized it easily and easy to use. The only reason I gave 4 star because it is not 32G as stated and it is only 29g. I don't know if that is supposed to be or not. I am happy anyway and would recommend this sd card to every body . You won't never regret .,use,positive
Very High Quality and what a deal! Fast shipping. I trippled the memory on my Galaxy S4 for only $22.90  ship. Anyway now i can have all my music and videos and pictures on my new external memory and my phone runs great. I have the Samsung Galaxy Gear watch so I needed more room to install programs for the gear. Awesome deal!,runs,positive

Slipped right into my Galaxy 4S and was able to transfer all media from my previous card to this one. Allows me to use my phone without worrying about running out of storage.,storage,positive
Fast delivery.  Works as described and does the job. Kingston reputation was final decision maker.  Would buy again.  Using with Samsung Galaxy S4.,delivery,positive
Nice pack. Installed easily in my galaxy S4. Works great.. Instead of paying $100 for a 32gb phone get a 16Gb phone and add the SD card...,pack,positive
Digital works or it doesn't (despite Monster Cable's hooey). This works and the price is right.,price,positive
This cable for under $7 was every bit as good as the ones sold in camera stores for $40+ dollars.  I'm very happy with my purchase.,cable,positive
The cable works as advertised and the price is unbeatable. I am not using it for a camcorder but for a canon elph camera with HDMI out. The photos and videos look great,cable,positive
Bought this hoping it would be as good as the $20 one at Staples. For the price...why not try it? Works great. No graininess. No interruption of transmission. Perfect length for my purposes.

We use this cable to hook our camera to the RV TV.  Works well and is long enough to be able to see at a table and operate the device.  The photos look nice on a large screen.,screen,positive
"Can view my pictures right from my Cannon 4Ti on my big screen TV with this.  It works great, but be sure to follow Cannon's directions.  You must have the cable connected and have the TV on before turning on the camera.  It is great to look at the pictures on the big screen before downloading them so you can pick the good pictures.",works,positive
"And I like the length....makes it much easier to make the connection between the cfamera and the TV.  My TV is mounted high on the wall, so length is essential if the camera is not to be dangling.  I haven't yet used the cable, but it appears to be strong and flexible.",length,positive
This HDMI cable is perfect for sending image and video from my digital camera to my HDTV. Being told that it isn't necessary to spend outrageous money on HDMI cable has proven true. I now have several inexpensive HDMI cables that work perfectly. I would purchase additional cables from this seller in the future.,HDMI cable,positive
Works flawlessly to connect my new Canon camera to all the HD TVs that I have hooked it to.  Great pics and vids and sound.,connect,positive
Works just like my shorter cables only with more optional length.  A good price for adding distance flexibility for camera to TV hookup when viewing pictures.,price,positive

Now my still camera can output full HD video/audio. Signal delivered without errors to monitor. 10 feet is a good length for getting around to the back of monitors or wall mounts.",HD video,positive

"Canon wanted $70 for a similar cable, but I bought this cable for my Canon Rebel T1 digital SLR at this remarkable price.  The cable is spectacular and my images and videos are very clear.

I bought this for the convenience of hooking up the HDMI port on my Canon camera to my HDMI tv. The length is just enough to sit back and scroll through your pictures (back and forth) at your own speed. Plugging the memory stick into the tv works as well; but you're stuck using the TV's slide show or other program to view.,HDMI port,positive

"This cable works well for connecting our camcorder directly to the TV.  It's long enough to allow me to sit a comfortable distance from the TV while using the controls on my camcorder.  The connectors on the ends are not bulky, and the cable is not unnecessarily stiff.  I can coil it up small enough to tuck into the camera bag while we're on the go.  We'll see how long it lasts, but it's working great for now.",cable,positive
A cable runs lifetime. Excellent product that is no longer wearing and giving good care never going to hurt you. Product 100 percent recommended,cable,positive

"Works perfectly at 1080p HD and in all other Canon EOS 7d modes. Costs less than 1/4 the price of the Canon equivalent. Expensive ""high end"" cables are a scam. It would be crazy to pay more. Tip: If you have never tried displaying your HD video or stills on an HD TV through an HDMI input, you will be shocked by the magnificent quality. Absolutely no comparison to the lousy pictures you got with the old analog inputs.",Works,positive
"I was looking for a light weight cable to go from a small video camera to a hdmi video capture card in the computer. Used two of these cables on two jvc camcorders, and they did not transmit a usable signal to a video card in the computer.  Changed to a heaver-weight cable that worked fine.

Until then, enjoy it!",- up,positive

Perfect for us 50+ technically challenged.  I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.",reception,positive

This is a great headset.  The volume is just a little lower than I would have expected but overall I am very happy with this headset and I would buy another if I had the need.,headset,positive

Unfortunately this wireless modem jack had a substantial amount of line noise.  I was able to connect to the internet at 1/10th the normal speed due to the insufficient connection.  I will give this to another family member to try in a newer house.,line noise,negative
"I made the mistake of buying the RCA Wireless Phone Jack to connect my TIVO downstairs in the living room where I don't have a jack.  It did not work.  Once I finally re-read what I needed, I bought the RCA Wireless Modem Jack.  It works perfectly and I haven't had any problems.",RCA Wireless Modem Jack,positive

"I tried this to use a fax two floors above my Vonage phone modem with fax outlet and performance was very spotty.  Sometimes it worked, but many times I'd get a ""poor line condition"" error message when I tried to fax.I finally broke down and ran telephone wire to that room through the walls.  It was a pain, but I finally got my fax to work all the time.",wire,negative
Works ok. Not worth the price tag new. I purchased refurb for half the price of new. Sounds is not CD quality. Sound is similar to FM radio as the device broadcasts over a FM signal. I live in a condo and placed 1 speaker in each bedroom and hooked the unit up to my stereo in the living room. Now I can listen to my Comcast Music Choice and CDs thru out my home.,Sounds,negative

Bought these for a long airplane ride. They worked pretty well for a few days but then the right side went out. That seems to be pretty common with this set. Also the battery compartment is in the cord and in a really awkward position where it hangs free and pulls on the headphones on one side.,right side,negative
"These were great at first purchase, but they did not hold up very well. They were used only inside the home and handled carefully.  One side speaker went and then a few months later, the other one stopped as well.  They lasted less than one year.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.We opted INSTEAD for PHILLIPS O'NEILL SHO9561/28.  These are extremely comfortable around your head, noise-reducing, fab sound.",speaker,negative
"I had these for only a few weeks and they have quit working entirely.  Fiddling with the cord doesn't help.  For $50, I expected much better quality.

"The sound quality is good, the fit comfy and the close-fitting cups make for good sound isolation even without the NR on.  When you turn on the NR, though, you'll hear that annoying jet engine hiss disappear into a faint background hum.YES.  I don't even listen to music with these.  I put them on, turn them on and then just SLEEP for the flight.AWESOME.",sound quality,positive
"I got these headphones in June. By August the sound in one ear was cutting out. I could move the wire and get it back temporarily. Fine, if you don't move your head.

I have never gotten a ""bad"" tape or had tapes break.",tape,positive
If you have an old VCR that still works and you enjoy taping your TV shows you now know how hard it is to find tapes. This will more than likely become even harder.  We located these on Amazon. They are a great buy and are becoming very difficult to find. These Maxwell takes are of very good quality and the prices if fantastic.,prices,positive

We, like everyone else, got rid of our VCR back when we made the transition to DVD, but in the last couple years we longed for a bit of nostalgia, so we bought a VCR, some tapes and these blank tapes to re-experience what it was like watching VHS as kids.

"I still use videotapes for easy, uncomplicated recording of things I don't plan on keeping indefinitely.  I've used two tapes from the pack I bought and they are just fine.  No problems so far.  Am rating 4 rather than 5 only because I haven't been using them long, and I haven't done much re-recording, which is something else I do.  I may buy more before it becomes impossible to buy them!",tapes,positive

"Fine sound, good reception over a decent range (looks like I can get around the yard without them making any big complaints), comfortable.I would say that the fidelity is only slightly less than the earbuds I'm used to.  And the separation is better than I expected.  There is a fair amount of hiss if no music is on, but I'm pretty picky and I think its totally tolerable.",reception,positive
"Overall very pleased with the product. The phones are lightweight, comfortable, and the sound quality is good anywhere in our house &amp; yard.

Great item to have around even if you only need to use it once a year... certainly beats having to buy a new CD or DVD player!",cleaning disc,positive
I have only used it once and it cleared the skipping problem. It has an interesting method to the way it works by playing a piece of classical music while the lens cleaner cleans the lens.,lens cleaner,positive

You can use a clean piece of cloth to clean your disk.  It did not remove the scratches from my disk.  Waste of money.,disk,negative
"Pretty simple product.  There are about 30 or so sheets in a package. Take one out and wipe in a circular motion.  Gets rid of the smudges and makes the disc shine.  However, if your kids touch it with grimy fingers it will struggle to remove those types of stains.",disc,positive
I use these wipes all the times on my electronics. They are lintless and have many uses besides wiping clean CDs and DVDs. I use them from time to time to clean VCR heads too. I just cut a small section and saturate it in alcohol. It works a treat. I highly recommend them.,wipes,positive

I have looking around for this item for some time. I had some trouble fined them. It work really good.,work,positive
"I had a DVD that kept on not playing every other disc l got from Netflix. It would say the disc was dirty or scratched.

Yes the colors are rather primary and boring, but they are dirt cheap and have withstood daily use and abuse.These travel around in my flight case and camera bags all the time and still work great.

I have no complaints pertaining to this cable.  I particularly like the molded connector feature.  It's always a personal fear of mine that my wires and cables will fail at the connector due to cheap construction.  I doubt that will be the case with this cable from Belkin.I also give kudos to the pricing.  I simply cannot argue with $3 for a 7 foot CAT5.,pricing,positive

"""Snag-resistent"" would be more accurate: a pair of flexible plastic ""ears"" guard the release lever that is the bane of normal CAT-5 cables, but those ears can bend down so that the lever is unprotected.  Otherwise, it's fine, and the price was right.  I will buy more of these when needed.",price,positive

"Good cable. It is nothing special, but does everything I need it to.",cable,positive
"They sent a different product.  Does not say that is made by Belkin anywhere on it.  They sent me a RJ45 cable made by FOXXCONN #E204149.  This does not have the protected cover 'snagless' over the release lever, as shown in the picture/item description.  I'm not happy; I do not plan to buy from this company again.....",cable,negative
Pros: Cheaper than any Brick and Mortar. Snagless design is nice. Let's me get on the interwebz.Cons: Hasn't made me a BLT. Belkin should incorporate this into their next CAT 5e design.TL;DR: Buy it,design,positive

"We bought two of these, basically because they were the cheapest 7 foot cable I could find on Amazon.  We've got other Belkin equipment, and have been happy with it.  But, to be honest I didn't expect much for that price.  I figured it would be cheaply made, toothpick size cable, or the end locks would break right away.  They were actually a pleasant surprise, especially for how cheap they were being sold.  Can't complain a bit.",cable,positive

"Well, its simply a cable...not much really to say about it, other than it works and its size met my needs - having different colors helps, that was the major reason behind this purchase - various cables to same location (or even different locations I presume), all have different colors making identifying them easier when necessary (couple times now, removing cables, checking link lights, etc.).

its a jumper. cant say much more than that. works. nice quality. went from switch to internet ready device. ok.,jumper,positive
"I'm guessing the ""snagless"" refers to the tall curves on either side of the clip on the ends of the cable. These tall tabs on both sides of the clip make it rather difficult to push the clip down when removing the cable, at least in tight places where you're limited in how you can twist your hand. Meh, no big deal. The price is good, the black looks really darn good, and they do their job just fine!",price,positive

The snagless part is really nice. Most any problems I've ever had end up being broken ends and this type seems to solve that problem.,snagless,positive
It's hard to review products that work as expected.  A 7 foot cable for less than $3 can't be a bad deal anyway.  This works as expected and was very inexpensive.  Grateful!,works,positive
"I love the price and free shipping with prime, this cable was a great buy and if i ever need another cable I will buy this one, I love the different ranges in length also. all around 5 stars on this product",shipping,positive

"I actually ordered this Belkin Ethernet cable for it's certified status and did receive a new (packaged) Belkin Ethernet cable. Plus, the price was the lowest I've found for this brand name cable. Of course, it's working fine. It's manufacture and durability appear among the best. Don't get me wrong, I use and am happy with the generics too...only difference seems to be the thicker construction of this Belkin brand. I expect unparalleled performance and longevity from this cable.",manufacture,positive

Belkin 7-Feet CAT5e Snagless Patch Cable (Gray) arrived before the due date and it was pachaged well. I sure like the color issue. All my cables are colored and I log them in a note book for easy access.,cables,positive
I like the snagless connection feature.  Otherwise it's your basic Belkin Ethernet cable for home or office networks.  It's good.,connection feature,positive
"I really like the 'snagless' feature on this one. I've broken off so many of the little clips on other ethernet cables. I think this will be much better protected. The length is good. I can sit in an easy chair near my desk with the laptop, and the cord reaches, but it's not so long to be cumbersome when I'm working on the desk.",chair,positive
"It's a CAT 5 cable, you use it for networking. There isn't much to say besides that I suppose, but it's very good for the low price.",price,positive
"There is nothing bad to say about this cable.  I bought three at once.  They aren't the exact ones shown in the picture, or at least, the ends look different, but they still have the ""snagless"" design, albeit a slightly different one.  Still works just fine as far as functioning as an ethernet cable.  I used it with my TrendNet ethernet switch, with no issues yet whatsoever.",works,positive
It's ethernet.. as advertised. Snag protectors work well. No complaints here; would buy again. 6 more words required required required.,Snag protectors,positive

I brought this cable when my old cable broke. I'm use it to connect my computer and wireless route together. It's a good cable.,cable,positive
It was really cheap and shipped quickly. Not too much that you can say about a cable except that it works. I needed a second one and this one did the trick.,shipped,positive
"New, does the job and arrived on time. Why would you pay two or three times more at an electonics store? Amozon is the place for all your cable needs.",cable,positive
Just what they siad it would be and it works just fine. The color helps to see which item is pluged into which port.,color,positive

Very good quality cable for a good price. I bought this for my desktop computer and they work great. The clip is not flimsy like most cables.,work,positive
"I have a HTPC and even though its rare sometimes I do need to use a keyboard with it.  I had a large print keyboard that is so easy to see in a not so brightly lit TV viewing area that I wanted to use.  Got this cable and routed it from the PC, around the back of the TV, and that puts the keyboard at a comfortable location for typing on.",cable,positive
"Needed to extend keyboard for older style desk. Six feet was clean, simple, and perfect fit. Cable flexible enough to move well without being so stiff it hangs up.",Cable,positive
This was a must have for my windows 95 keyboard! I enjoy the classic keyboards and this made it that much easier to use!,windows 95,positive
great cable.  works great and was plenty long enough for my purposes.  Belkin is a great brand for this kind of stuff too,cable,positive
"This extension fits into my older PC's PS/2 port better than the cable from the keyboard! The connection is snug, but not too tight. It works just as well on my new self-built Win 8 computer. I've got an old keyboard that is really great, so I'm using it alternately for both computers.",connection,positive
"If you want a longer cord on an older non-usb keyboard, this extension cable works great.Keyboard plugs into it snugly and wont fall out easily while moving it around or lightly tugging on it.",Keyboard,positive

and it's screw handles are ribbed and very easy to grasp.Nicely constructed.,constructed,positive
Well built. Thumb screws are very ergonomic. I use these cables with standard external modems like the USRobotics 56K faxmodems. Good value for the money.,Thumb screws,positive
What more can you say. It works like expected. The cable didn't appear to be cheaply made and all hardware interfaced using the cable worked perfectly.,hardware interfaced,positive
This is a decent cable for the price.  The connection of the cable to the connector is rugged and will resist breaking easily.  Cable is well insulated and connectors are of typical Belkin quality.  Have used this in several environments including in the lab setting with satisfactory performance.,connection of the cable,positive

"I installed these in my garage and am very pleased with the sound and clarity.  A salesman at a big box chain electronics store tried to talk me out of them, but for $30.00, you just can't beat these speakers.  They are easy to set up.  Anyone looking for an inexpensive speaker for a garage, patio or for a secondary stereo system would be very happy with them.",set up,positive
"I bought these speakers for less than $20 and am very impressed with their quality. I put them on our patio and the entire area is filled with great sound (the patio is about 15'x30'). If you are looking for an inexpensive set of speakers for outside, this is your pair.",sound,positive
I bought these speakers to use on our deck and also to point out at our pool.  I am amazed at the sound quality for such a small box.  If you are looking for an inexpensive set of speakers to place outdoors then these are a perfect fit.  I am going to order a second pair in order to increase my coverage area.,sound quality,positive
These speakers sounded great but I do like to crank up the occasional KISS or VanHalen and these speakers just stopped working. I've never blown a speaker before but I guess that's what happened.,speakers,negative

"I have these all over in my house!  They work great!  I had one for many years that I paid over $50 for but I got my money's worth for sure!  So when I was able to see these on Amazon for less money, I was happy!  They work well, they allow you to plug up many things and move freely.  The cord from the power strip is average length but it does the job!  I would recommend.",They work,positive

I bought my Zip drive from third-party seller ElizabethLeeHR and even though it was used, it ran on my Win7 laptop flawlessly. No driver needed; pure plug-n-play! Of course, Zip drives eventually all develop the click-death syndrome, so I can only rate this 4 stars!",ran,positive

I use a viking 128Mb CompactFlash card in my Canon S200 digital camera. Simply plugging the card into this reader and the reader into the PCMCIA slot on my Mac TiBook automatically launches iPhoto and imports the contents of the card into the laptop.

"Adapter works fine -- laptop is 5 years old, but everything worked fine.  Good price at Amazon.",price,positive
"This adapter works great for quickly moving digital images from cameras to your pc.  The only problem I have with it relates to the overall length of the card.  They should have made it 1/2 inch longer so you could remove it more easily from the PC card slot.  When inserted, it is &quot;flush&quot; with the PC.",adapter,positive
"This Compact Flash Adapter work's great. All you do is snap you compact flash card into it and slap it into your Slot and bam! It is also much faster for me then hooking up my Digital camera to the computer using a USB cord and AC/DC adapter (saves on batteries). Faster in the hook up time and faster in downloading and uploading. I can highly recommend this product, I am very happy with it.",downloading,positive
I use it with my IBM Thinkpad to download pictures from a Nikon Coolpix 5000 with a 512MB CF card. This adapter works great. Plugged it in and WinXP automatically recognized it as E drive.

This is a very high quality leather case with good hardware.  My laptop fits well and it has a place for almost everything.  The almost is a limited amount of space to carry the computer power supply and cords.  There isn't a pocket deep enough to carry those items without causing the outside to bulge.

Pros:* Heavy enough to stay where you put it.* Cord long enough to be useful.* More aesthetically pleasing than the long beige strips.Cons:* Octopus style wiring does not support most cord organization strategies.* Pricey.,Cord,positive
This is the only one of my many surge protectors that has a 16 foot cord and I find that to be so useful.

I like this Kensington model so much that I have just purchased another as a gift.,cord,positive
"This is a nice looking and space saving 6 socket outlet. I replaced an old PowerSquid with this unit and it has worked as expected. I really like the color coded sockets and the circular design, which resulted in a smaller footprint.",design,positive

"The circular design saves desk space and the extra long cord is helpful in setting up in an office cubicle. There is central power button that turns off all the items plugged into the colorful base.

This is a great hub. Work well. This is part of my first network that I installed myself. I used all Netgear compnents and I am pleased with the simplicity of the installation. Just plug and go. I do recommend the  Netgear FA310TX Nic's also.,installation,positive
"I got this hub in the mail, plugged in the power, plugged it in to my DSL modem, plugged by PC and laptop into it, and everything just worked!  No configuration or anything (despite my DSL setup), basically no problems of any kind.  Can't beat that!",configuration,positive
"These days, there is almost never a reason to buy a hub...  For most applications, everyone should be buying a switch.I just bought for of these for our lab, because nothing beats a hub for allowing you to sniff network traffic when debugging network software.For someone wanting a REAL hub, the DS104 is a real hub!",hub,positive

Easy to follow instructions had my home network up and running within ten minutes. Never a problem since.",internet access,positive
"For just a simple 10 Mbps hub, this is an excellent one for the price. It is compact and sturdy, especially with the metal casing. Link and status lights are handy along with the Normal/Uplink switch. No software installation needed - plug the power in and the CAT cables and you're all set!",price,positive
"A great hub that allows you to share an uplink onto another network with 3 computers or have a local network of 4 computers.

"I own the Kodak DC3400 digital camera, and can't say enough about this case.  It has room for my battery charger, extra set of batteries, all PC cables, Kodak's software CD, and the manual that came with my camera.If your digital camera is similar in size to Kodak's DC3400, get this bag.  It's simply the best balance, between compact size - and having enough room for all your accessories.",case,positive
I ordered two and they came in the standard distribution box that stood up to thefreight carrier.Inside the carton was the two seperate retail sales boxes in premium shape.Units worked right out of the box once batteries were connected.Powerchute CD was original older version and the web had the updated 3.0 (2012).Stable angled plug with a very sturdy cord.,plug,positive

Nice headphones. No noise escapes the headphones to disturb others.  Got them for my daughter's keyboard.  She says the only negative is that they don't have much range of volume but still great for when you want to play  when others are trying to sleep or whatever.,noise,positive
They are not exactly noise cancelling as I read in some of the reviews. You can hear the tv a little and the person watching the tv can hear a little bit of the music if it's loud. It does allow for the one practicing to hear their music well. For the price I'd say it's worth it if your child is always practicing the same time you need it to be quiet or the tv is on.,price,positive
"This headset is inexpensive, so don't expect a product you will have for years to come.  However it has good sound and the ear foam is denser than most low end product which makes it comfortable.",sound,positive

I  chose this item to go with my synthesizer.  It fits perfect and I can hear very clearly.  It appears to provide a surround sound.,fits,positive
"Terrific for making adjustment in each individual EQ for vocals and instruments.  Can help each voice, and instrument, sound better.  Plus it gives the vocals a better monitor mix.",mix,positive
"These inexpensive earphones provide adequate rendering of sound from TV, movies, etc.  However, in terms of comfort, they leave much to be desired.  The flat, hard plastic speaker enclosure is only covered by a thin, somewhat scratchy &#34;cloth&#34; material.  It provides inadequate cushioning of one's ears from the hard plastic of the speaker enclosures.  A cotton, or even a foam covering would be an improvement.",speaker enclosure,negative
"Well built good sound worth the price, can be used for short and long range applications, multiple plugs makes it versatile.",built,positive
These are light and inexpensive. Needed ones with this type of plug. Use it with a portable keyboard. Has a nice long cord. Didn't need a fancy stereo headset. The sound is good and they clamp well over my ears. Most of the fancier headphones start to fall off my ears even when tightening the head band to the max. Like the feather weight.,sound,positive
"I bought two of these for my kids and they are awful. The picture quality is so low that only about 10% of the photos are worth keeping. And being for my young children, my standards are very low. I bought them almost as a toy, and STILL I'm severely disappointed. DO NOT BUY.",picture quality,negative
"This speakers are great sounding little things for the computer.  If you are looking for a set of speakers with a subwoofer this is definately not a bad place to start.  I have two sets of them and have had no problems with them, and yes... They are loud.",speakers,positive
I got this from a yard sale. The cords are unwieldy. The bass is too strong and is not adjustable. Stay away from systems that do not have adjustable subwoofers.,bass,negative
"This lightweight headset does the job, and the price is right. It's held up well for 4 months of daily use. The fact that it lightly hangs on the ear rather than fitting snugly took a couple days to get used to, but it's nice that it is so light.",price,positive
The mike wand is only 4 1/2 inches long.  Since I have 7 inches between my ear and mouth the mike did not get close enough and my voice was too low.  It was otherwise comfortable and I imagine it would be fine for a person  with a smaller face.,mike wand,negative
I modded this to attach to my AD700X's. Perfect gaming headset now. I hear and speak with clarity now. Antlion ModMic broke and didn't feel like spending $50 plus on the 4.0. Bought the mic and  some mounting tape! Would recommend over and over!!!!,gaming headset,positive
"I bought this mic to put it on my Audio-Technica headphone AD700s, I knew cutting the plastic headband off if the microphone was garbage I'd just have to eat the cost. Luckily as others have suggested on forums and even in reviews here the mic works great, had to use some industrial strength sticky tape to keep them on the metal of my headphones, but for the price this microphone is unbeatable in sound quality.",sound quality,positive
I've been using this mic for a couple of years now with a nice pair of headphones. Velcroed them on and they're good to go!,headphones,positive
"I like this headset. I have four of them. I find I use PTT most of the time, to avoid cut off first syllables, etc. When I absolutely have to be hands-free, though, the VOX will work, too. Decent, understandable audio, unlike some I've used",audio,positive
"These work perfectly with my Motorola MR350 radios, also purchased fromAmazon. I got them (headsets) only as an after-thought. The sensitivity settings on theradios (for head-set-use) for VOR use are a little touchy. I prefer using thePTT button WITH headsets connected... No breathing or extraneous soundskicking in the transmitter. Still, a good headset.",work,positive
These work very well with my walkie talkies and give you some privacy when talking through the walkie talkies.  I highly recommend them.,privacy,positive

"This is very good headset, sound quality is good. The headband is adjustable and very confortable. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn't do VOX with my FR50s (because the FR50 doesn't have VOX capability). Price is reasonable too. What more can I say about a simple headset?",sound quality,positive
"Plugged this into a Talkabout T6200 and it just transmitted.  Transmit button didn't work, VOX didn't work.  I have a pair of some older model, I should try the headset on those.Would give this 0 stars if I could.",Transmit button,negative
The item served its use; however not the quality I thought it was priced at.,quality,negative
Good product at a good price.The earpiece has soft foam so that it does not hurt the ear after hours of use as one finds with an ear bud or the over the ear headset.Be careful to match the headset to the actual radio purshaced. This headset does not work with all radios.,earpiece,positive
"This mic works well, but it's a bit awkward.  I got it because the webcam I was using didn't have a built-in microphone for my Yahoo Messenger and Skype live chats.  It was crisp and clear sounding, but I've since upgraded my webcam and no longer need it so much.",mic,positive
"Good quality, good audio and made by Motorola. Was going for a ear cover design but this is way sleeker.",audio,positive
"Very dissatisfied with this, the earphone (earbud) is fine, but your voice is very muffled and garbled using the microphone. Even a females voice, usually more clear than a males voice, is very hard to understand using the microphone. I have also not been able to get the iVox feature to work with this either.",iVox feature,negative
I purchased these to use with the Motorola TalkAbout and the cases while biking to work.  I sometimes rode a little faster than my biking partner and these helped us to stay in touch.  This was a good purchase.,cases,positive
"I have only one complaint about this earbud/mic unit - the cord is too short. Otherwise, the sound quality is good and the built-in mic with PTT works fine. A 2.5mm extension cord from radio shack (meant for phone headsets, #43-2003) alleviates the cord problem, however. The earbud cushion is comfortable. To be discreet, this is an excellent accessory for your Motorola FRS radio.",built - in mic,positive
Works good but I'm worried for how long. The wire is thin and I'm always worried its going to break at the many connection points. Works with the Motorola two way radios.,two way radios,neutral
We all use these with our Motorola radios while hunting.  The animals are not spooked due to the earpiece.  The earpiece fits comfortably in my ear without the foam.  Just press the button clipped to your collar and others can hear you even with a quiet whisper.,earpiece,positive
"Motorola 53724 Remote Speaker Mic works well with my scanner, with the speaker mic my radio sounds loud and clear.",speaker mic,positive
It looked good in the box but after hooking it up to my 2-way radio i soon realized it's a joke. You can hear people through it but couldn't talk through it. I had to unplug the mic if I wanted to talk to anyone. 100% waste of $20. I would return it but my luck with getting my money back when I return something isn't good since I never do. Save your $20 and buy something else.,mic,negative

"I am impressed with this speaker/mic. I'm a first responder so I was interested in getting something like what I have at work for my family radios. The mic is VERY sensitive, so have it about 6-12"" away from your mouth and talk normally... they will hear you fine.  The weight feels very substantial in your hand and feels almost as rugged as what I have at work. I can tell that this is a Motorola product.",weight,positive
"Nice having a speaker mic. Setting the channel on the radio and putting it in the side pocket of the pack and only having the speaker mic on the shoulder strap. Too bad Motorola can not reduce its weight. When hiking, every ounce counts.",mic,positive

"Not sure if these tapes are knockoffs, but these tapes jam in our Sony BM-575 portable recorders.  They seem to work OK in our Lanier desk recorders.If we hold one of the the Sony cassettes next to a TDK cassette (which work fine in the BM-575) the tape in these Sony cassettes looks visibly taller.Unfortunately we are stuck with about 30 3-packs now.

I've had my radio for about six months now and I could not be happier.  It pulls in stations from all over the globe 24 hours a day.  It is easy to use and extremely reliable.  I recently took it to Mexico with me so I could keep up on U.S. news and it provided me with several U.S. broadcasts.  I love this radio.,use,positive
This is a great radio. It arrived on time. It is everything it said it was and more. I would recommend this radio to everyone. This is my second Grundig and I enjoy them both.,radio,positive
This is one of the best portable radios out there.It has great shortwave reception! The F.M. and A.M. both have great sensitivity and selectivity; the ability to pull in weak stations next to strong ones. The only reason I don't give this radio 5 stars is because of the telescoping antenna. I've been through 5 radios because the antenna becomes lose and breaks after a long period of use. Other than that this would be a perfect radio.,selectivity,positive
"This is the best camera I have seen for the price. It has tons of features. I would highly recommend getting a Compact Flash Card Reader, so you don't drain your batteries on the camera xfering. Also the Kodak Batteries are the best I have ever used. I would recommended getting the 2 hour rapid charger kit, you will get another set of batteries and be able to charge one set and use another.",price,positive

Needed a short cord to reduce clutter between my router and a switch.  Wanted a reliable brand name (Belkin) cord with quality connectors.  This one looks well built. Only shortcoming is that it is cat 5e (350 speed) vs cat 6 (500 speed).  Didn't see a 3 foot one in Cat 6 but the price for the Cat 5e was very fair.,price,positive

Sure, there may exist purists that really believe a more expensive patch cable yields better signal delivery, but they'll have a hard time convincing me of an iota of difference.  Belkin is a reliable name that produces a reliable product at a highly competitive price.  I would buy, and will buy, these cables again and again.",price,positive
This ethernet cable is a great value and works like a charm.  Had it for 2 years and have never had a problem with it.,ethernet cable,positive

A good quality cable at an affordable price. It has worked well for me and I would purchase additional cables of this brand.,price,positive
Good quality and you can't beat the price.  BestBuy gets about $25 for a similar cable.  I would buy it again.,quality,positive
These do exactly what you need them to do! What more can you ask for from patch cables? Great quality from Belkin.,quality,positive

"You'd think all ethernet cables are the same, but after installing thousands of pre-terminated cables in my profession, you get a good intuition of what's good and what's not.

This cable is what it is. I needed some extra cabling to attach a computer to my ethernet hub and it works fine.,ethernet hub,positive
"This cord works great and the length is just right for me. My only complaint is that the orange isn't quite as festive in person. I thought it would be more neon, but it's actually the dingy orange that you sometimes see on really long extension cords. Orange is my favorite color, so I paid a little extra for it, but I wish I had just gotten one of the cheaper ones.",cord,positive
"Good quality cable. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good, cheap patch cable. I bought them to replace some home made cables, and they work perfectly.",patch cable,positive

Not much to say about wire - it does the job.  We use this to connect an upstairs computer with a downstairs printer.,wire,positive
It's a piece of cat5 with snagless ends.  It is blue in color and approximately three feet in length.  Good for making short patch connections.  Nothing wrong with it at all I would purchase more if needed.,length,positive
I saw the mixed reviews but went ahead and took a chance on this.  I am happy to report that it was in fact 3 feet and works perfectly connecting my modem to my computer.  The price was great the big box store wanted $25 for a 6 foot cord.This is a great value for a small space and it looks just like the picture.  I recommend the product.,works,positive
"I just installed a network between my two home computers, and this cable did the job perfectly.  It worked just like it is supposed to, and the 50ft length gave me all the cable I needed, with plenty left in case I decide to re-arrange the desk locations.  WELL worth the $10.99 price.",price,positive

It is connected to our router in the living room and right now I am  playing the music player on our Xbox accessing my mp3 songs on this computer. So happy with this Belkin ethernet cable.

"While it seems silly to sit and glorify the merits of a cable, the Belkin series of cables are truly great. I have a number of varieties of them, and they are all excellent - well made, work great, and the snagless aspect actually is qite good. Good connectors that won't break soon, too.",connectors,positive
"Great quality cable, I wouldn't buy anything of a lesser quality and it has the stubs on the end to protect the connector that often breaks off....",cable,positive
I bought it to hook up my x-box 360 to my computer. It works great and i did not have to spend $100.00 on a wireless.,works,positive
This product works flawlessly and provides a great signal for my extended network system. I highly recommend this cable.,signal,positive
I snaked it through a wall.  The ends held up just fine.  My media PC has excellent internet connection through FIOS.,internet connection,positive
"What can I say...it is cable. It is long, it is blue, it does its job and the price was right..",price,positive
"I'd not going to go nuts here - I mean, it's just a cable. But 50ft of CAT5 at the oxymoronic 'Best Buy' would mean unloading your wallet, so $12 is a reasonable price and the cable has been working fine ever since.",price,positive

"50ft for $9!!  What else needs to be said?This cable is every bit as good as the $50 bundles you'll see at Office Depot.  I bought about 7 of these and every one of them works great.

"Good product and it does the job.... and great price.....  seems to be very well made, just as most all Belkin products are.",price,positive
I opted for this one after reading reviews of some of the other cables made by other manufacturers. It is the cable ends that are usually of concern. The Belkin cables are fine. The ends are very well made and snap into their sockets nicely. I have used it to hardwire an internet streaming box to my router. It is functioning just fine.,cable ends,positive

"Gotta put in 20 words,,  so what can I say, it is a pre made item, made by a great cable maker, so this thing will work great and it was a great price,  usually stores are out to kill you on price so this fit the bill to connect two rooms together on my network.",cable,positive
Works perfectly. Great value. Connecting internet modem to TV in living room via basement in order to use Netflix/Pandora. Blue makes it easy to recognize what it is if we ever have to distinquish it from other lines.,value,positive
"This 50ft cable is flawless, snagless, no more kinks in the cable.The connectors are nice and soft and I love the blue color.This cable works like a charm and well worth the price at 50ft length.Highly recommended - cheaper than Radio Shack!",price,positive
"I needed a cable to go across my house, and this one did that job fine. I was really afraid I would have to pay a lot of money for a 50' cable, but this cable proved me wrong. It is not expensive(...). The snagless connectors were very useful when I was dragging the wire under my floors (though some tape probably could have done the job). I have not noticed any loss in performance because of this cable.",performance,positive

Prompt delivery. The extension cord allows me the extra length I sometimes need when I must be away from my desk while teaching and using my ipad.,delivery,positive
"I used this for a server I have running in a corner of the room away from my PC.  I plugged this into one monitor port, and now I don't have to use a finicky remote control software to access the PC.  The cable is good quality and provides a clear image of the screen.",image,positive
Great price and it did exactly what I needed it to do. If you need to make your cord stretch after rearranging some furniture this works fantastic.,price,positive
I use this to have an extra monitor closer to my ham shack.  It does the job but the screws don't reach the nuts so I only could plug the cord in and could not screw it in place.,cord,neutral
ordered a few of these they work great.  Perform like the newest cables with out the cost.  A true buy.,work,positive

Purchased to use second monitor on my PC. Configuration of my setup required a longer VGA cable. Does the job perfectly!,VGA cable,positive
"The first two times I plugged this into my projector, it took a couple times unplugging and replugging to get it connected.  Now I can't get it to work at all.  Unfortunately, I had it over a month before I tested it, so now I can't return it.",unplugging,negative

"these speakers are great, great sound from a cheap sound card, full sound and power.",power,positive
Very high level of noise three pixels on all the time. Otherwise it's about as good as a low quality surveillance cam. I don't know  what the other reviewers are used to but they need to look around. For the price it's OK in good light forget it when the light begins to fade. The software is somewhat deficient too. when I tried to do a video capture it froze up.I would not recommend this to anyone,software,negative
"This is an incredible camera, especially in regard to its low-light capabilities. I used mine for years, but as Windows OS versions changed, the camera became less and less cooperative with the PC, and with Windows 7 finally stopped working completely. (It didn't do that well with XP, either).So, if you're running an OS older than XP, you can't go wrong with this camera; especially at this price!",camera,positive
"Pros: It's actually a relabled Vicam, which has been favorably reviewed in the past.  Excellent low light performance.  Detachable USB cable is easily replaced with a longer one.  Comes with an unregistered copy of webcam32  which is an excellent program for putting your camera on the web.Cons:  Apparently 3com now owns the product, so expect no driver updates and no  useful customer support.",program,positive
"Far better resolution and optical quality than more recent webcams, these 3Com computer video cameras are still useful many years after being discontinued. At the time, they were available with interchangeable focal length lenses as well. Worth seeking out.",optical quality,positive
"&#34;Great camera. But it is made for Widows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 2000. The furnished drivers are for those systems only, and will not work with later operating systems. Also, I cannot locate any Vista or Win7 drivers for the camera. Too bad !The Mac does not even recognize that the camera is connected.",Widows 95,neutral

"High-quality stylus, 3 of them even! They even seem better than the one that was actually included with my Palm Pilot. A stylus is an easy thing to misplace, lose, just like a pen, so its great to have a few in your briefcase or purse!",stylus,positive
"Your Palm V probably came with two -- one metal with plastic ends and a hidden pin to reset your palm, and one all plastic.  These are exact replacements for the metal stylus that came with your Palm.  That's about  it!For the price it seemed like a good idea to have them around just in  case.  You can also keep a spare in each car, or whatever.",stylus,positive
The USB version of the Dazzle DM4100 video capture box is an excellent way to capture video into the MPEG1 format in real time.  This format plays back well on modern PC and Mac computers but doesn't take up too much hard drive space.  The quality isn't as good as a professional encoder but then  it costs about a tenth of the price.,format,positive
"If you want a small, low resolution image that has unsynchronized audio (or you have forever to wait on the audio sync), this one is for you!  Oh, yea, don't expect to be able to videoconference with your camcorder.If  you want to capture home videos with no or low loss of quality and want it  done at a reasonable speed, you probably don't want this one (or any other  USB or similarly slow external connection).",audio sync,negative

This is a great little camera. A real bargain at this price. Excellent color and quality pictures. Only drawback is slow serial interface to computer. Buy a Flashpath floppy adapter or a memory card reader to  transfer pictures faster. A good card reader that won't crash your system  is made by SIIG. They call it their USB DigiFilm-Combo Reader. About $79  street price. Also get the MAHA charger and NIMH batteries reviewed  elsewhere on this page.,color,positive

We use this in our alarm clock for when the power goes out as it often does.  So far this little rechargable hasn't needed a recharge & is doing a fine job making sure when get up on time when the power goes out & then back on while were sleeping.  I gave it 4 stars because we haven't had it long enough to get a really good opinion on it aside from the one just given.,rechargable,positive
SO FAR SOO GOOD ...IT WORKS AND RUN LIKE A POWER BATTERY!!! IF YOU LIKE POWER THIS IS A MUST BUY,RUN,positive
"This battery, like other rechargable batteries I own, is rated for 8.4 volts and I'm told is likely even less.  Why not go with Maha?  It's rated at over 9 volts, which for my applications (powering a headroom micro dac) makes all the difference.  I can only imagine that a battery with a rating which conforms to a devices' designated power requirements, is better across the board.",battery,negative
"I teach 4 one-hour classes a week, which require a 9-Volt battery for the mic. I got tired of buying these every week or two, so I bought the rechargable.  The single charge lasts the entire week.

"If you're going to sync from more than one computer, this is a far better option than buying an additional cradle.

It does what is advertised. Charges palm V and is also  downloads to pc. That I haven't been able to try as the plug on the end of the cable is female and the connection to my laptop is also female. Need an adapter. The charger works great and if it came with a usable connection I would have given it a 5 star rating.,charger,positive

"This travel kit takes too much space. If you would like to connect your Palm V or Vx to two computers, I suggest you either buy another cradle, or pack your cradle.

Remember you can also hot sync through the infrared port if  you have a computer with an infrared port, but this drains the batteries a  lot.",kit,negative
"This is very useful addition for Palm for people who travel internationally. Unless you are someone who travels to all the corners of the world, you may never use some of the plug adapters. I particularly like the hotsync cable. I can use it for syncing the Palm with my notebook.Comes in a neat pouch too.",hotsync cable,positive
"I travel quite often, and lugging around the weighty Hot Sync/Charger cradel adds some pounds to my briefcase. With the travel kit, the charger and Hot Sync cable are seperate, and much lighter, without the stand like the cradle. Works just as good as the cradle too. I like the fact that the charger comes with 3 extra plugs, which can be used for different countries! Great travel kit at a reasonable price.",price,positive
"Like the previous reviewer, I also purchased the Kodak NiMh batteries and charger and have found it to be a much-needed improvement to the standard package.  Too bad Nikon doesn't include this as standard equipment with its  digital cameras.  My wish list:  an automotible cigarette-lighter adapter  so I can recharge batteries &quot;on the fly&quot;.  Overall, a quality  product that functions as advertised and provides good value for the money.",value,positive
"It's a great charger. You can basically bring it to anywhere you go. But one advice, don't buy too many batteries, because most of the time you think  that you really need a lot of batteries, but after you really bought  a lot of batteries, you will realize that you don't need that much! And  regret about wasting money. And if you are out of battery, you can just  charge them again, two hours after, they are full charged.",charger,positive

"Works great. after all how difficult could it be to make a good floppy drive.I was thinking of getting a used one, but this one is cheaper and gives peace of mind.- compared it with sony external usb and found this one cheaper.- very sturdy, dropped couple of times but it still works.- very plug and play.- never gave me a chance to complain.- works comparaeable to my sony vaio integrated floopy drive",floppy drive,positive
Fabulous product at a great price. A very simple &#34;plug 'n' play&#34; way to transfer all those pictures that are on floppy disks,price,positive
Easy to install (just plug it in) and you have instant floppy. I have a few old photo disks that I wanted to copy the files off of and no computer with a floppy disk. Very inexpensive but well constructed and works great.,install,positive
"EASY HOOK UP,DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPPOSED TO DO.THE PRICE IS NICE TOO!A LOT OF US 'OLD TIMERS' STILL GOT STUFF ON FLOPPYS.",PRICE,positive
"Easy hook up --- just plug and play.  Now that non of the newer computers have a floppy drive, I thought it was important to get a drive before they stop making them.  I have a lot of old photos and documents stored on floppies and no way to access them, until I got this drive.  I like it so well that I will probably order another one.",hook up,positive
"I never thought i would need to look at a floppy drive again, but lo and behold, a customer had some very important data stored on some very old floppies.  This saved his data and his price can't be beat.  Not a bad addition to have for your toolkit for that rainy day.",price,positive
"Does as advertised, performs well. Worked flawlessly right out of the box. Everything needed was already present in my Wintendo 7 install.",performs,positive
"Arrived on time, in good shape, and works without hassle on Windows 7.......... we need 3.5 for our business machines and this fits the bill.",Windows 7,positive
It works fine.  Just plug it into a USB port and it will allow me to access old floppy disks.,works,positive
"My new computer has no 3.5 inch floppy drive, but I still have several such floppy disks with data I wanted to retrieve.  This disk drive read the floppies just fine so I could save the data directly to the computer.This drive is a little slow, but it gets the job done.  For the price, it's a great and very useful buy!",disk drive,positive
I used this external floppy disk drive to recover some photos and documents that I had from back in the DOS and Windows 3.1 days.  It read my disks just fine and I was able to transfer everything to my new system.,disks,positive

"Works well on both OSX and Windows 7, haven't tried it on Linux yet.  Now I remember how slow floppy disks were....",Windows 7,positive
"Works well, for the price. Occasional miss read. Unplug and try again fixes the problem. Just was trying to recover some old files I found. Did the job. Cheap enough.",price,positive
"I bought this to use for work and works great, I've had no problems and I like that its plug and play.",works,positive
Everyone in a while I get a customer that needs/wants to read old floppy disks.This drive is great for the money and installs in windows 7 and 8 without drivers.Good drive!,drive,positive
I plugged it into my computer and... nothing. Tried it in several different computers (windows 7 and windows 8) and the device is completely dead. Will not be recognized by computers. The worst part is I cannot return it as of a few days ago. I would recommend trying a different brand.,return,negative
"Plugged it in, popped in a disk and in a couple seconds the disk appeared on the desktop. Shockingly Mac OS still has actual icons for a floppy disk built in.Highly recommended if you need to dump some old files off floppies.The only minor downside is it makes a hum/whine while idle with a disk in it. I guess that's the price you pay for 2x the RPM.",OS,positive
"No problems with the drive, delivered as promised, good price.  This really has saved me as I have some old 3 1/2 diskettes that have photos on them and no working machines with a drive to read them.",price,positive
This unit seems to work great. I was able to read all but three of my 50 floppy discs. Not sure why the three wouldn't read. Might be their age. But the Sabrent Floppy drive was great. It worked from the USB power.,Sabrent Floppy drive,positive
"I thought for the price it would be a complete kit. It's OEM! It's just a bare drive, no cable, no driver, manual - nothing. If you know what you're doing or are replacing an old floppy it'll do, but you can find bare drives for a much much cheaper price elsewhere. They should put that it's OEM in the description.",floppy,neutral
"This review is for the Sabrent USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive (FL-UDRV) Black.  It's a well built, quality floppy disk drive that comes with a hardwired USB 2.0 cable for connection to the computer.  There's really not much to say except that it works ---- simple setup, plug and wait for drivers to load and install --- then use the drive.  How hard is that?",setup,positive
Works well and allowed me to transfer all old data off floppy.  Now I can get rid of old computer.,data,positive
"*  It is indeed plug and play...I just plugged it into the USB on my Lenovo laptop (Windows 7).  I was able to view every file on numerous floppy disks.*  Great price.  If you have some old, old floppies around, I recommend getting this little beauty.  You might have some wonderful old files/memories you had forgotten about on those floppies.",price,positive
I plugged the drive in and my Win 7 PC indicated it was downloaded a driver.  After that I could read and writes files just fine.  It does have an annoying habit of refusing to eject disks with labels on them.  I've had to simultaneously hold the eject button and extract the disk with tweezers.,drive,neutral
This is a well made floppy drive that has no apparent issues that could have crossed paths with me or the application I put it in.,floppy drive,positive

was terrible did auto connect and was complete waste if time thanks for telling it doesnt always work good going,auto connect,negative
"Wish I read the reviews here more completely. This was a complete piece of trash. Like with others, the speaker would not play for more than 30 seconds at a time no matter what I did. After a while I could feel that the speaker was over heating so I left it unplugged. Sure enough it came back and played for another 30 seconds and then quit. It's going back to Amazon immediately!",speaker,negative
Just hooked it up and it works great. We've got the Reds game on the television inside and the audio coming through the speaker outside so we won't miss anything! So far so good.,works,positive
"The sound from the unit is descent given the size and construction. The wireless system,  however is pretty bad. In an urban area you might be able to get 20', but even then you'll get periodic interference. In a more rural setting it becomes moderately usable, with more like 40' and fewer blasts of junk.",wireless system,negative
"I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this unit was to set up.  Within 5 minutes, I had the unit set up and playing on my back patio.  No static or distortion on CD or radio once I &quot;tuned&quot; in the box.  Unit sounded great with a balanced mix of bass and treble.  Make sure that the speaker is sheltered outside since the instructions explicitly state that it will not handle excessive rain or wet weather!",set up,positive
"Being able to enjoy music with a wireless speaker is fantastic. The speaker is small enough to be innocuous but delivers pretty good quality sound. On occasion, especially very humid days, it's harder to get the receiver to pick up the signal, but overall we're happy with the product.If you can buy the speaker at a deep discount, like we did, then you'll be happy with the product.",quality sound,positive
"Works fine for my purpose, a wireless speaker I can move wherever I want to listen to my main stereo.  I use it in the kitchen and by the pool, which are not wired for my stereo.  Sounds about as good as an inexpensive boom box and has a good range.",range,positive
"This must have been the best handycam for the price when I bought it! And I love the death out of it! All I can say is that this camera would still be great if it were still manufactured, 3 years later! If you find one someone who is selling this camera in good condition, by all means get it! It's a great camera!",price,positive
"A great little radio. I used it on my flight from AZ to NH. The FM and AM came in just great. Not sure about the shortwave as I wasn't able to pick up anything. But then again, I didn't really try. I like the small size. Fits in my jacket pocket. A smart looking radio. Price is reasonable.CON: The ear plugs are useless. Will not stay in the ear.",Price,positive
It's a very good radio for emergencies and Grundid is an excellent name. I also believe it was on sale. It works fine and I recommend it Highly.,works,positive

Great product even a simpleton can use it, follow on screen instructions and you are home free.",screen instructions,positive
It works for me . It also has a few extras such as audio/video tests . I don't have any complaints .,audio,positive
I purchase Maxell products because they works. Needed to clean the old DVD player. Put the disc in and followed instructions. Simple as that.,instructions,positive
"I was about to retire an old standalone DVD recorder, because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs.  I bought this lens cleaner and -- voila! -- the recorder is working again.  Super easy to use (it's simply a DVD that you insert into your machine, and the menus tell you what to do).  Highly recommended.",lens cleaner,positive
Works great...For what I'm using it for it works good. I liked the excellent price...I would tell friends about this product.,price,positive
"It is easy and comfortable to wear, not sure if it was just my product or so is made in general, but the cleaner disc is not fully adjusted to where the optical pickup lens is located (by just two millimeters), and I can not taste good if it fulfills its job well.",optical pickup lens,neutral
This disc could not be read in either of my DVD players.  Refund requested.  Would not pruchase this item.  Do not buy!,disc,negative
I was in desperate need of a DVD lens cleaner. This is great. I was expecting something with more dust fibers attached. The wispy few fibers manufactured with the disc perform admirably.,lens,positive

"Does not work at all on my brand new PC (98se, usb), very bad software, support is helpless... Advertised Audible format is not actually supported ('yet' they say...) Don't buy now... this is a rushed out (though late)  buggy product...",support,negative
"The Rio 500 holds a decent amount of music, and the battery lasts longer than I expected. But best of all, it is Mac compatible and the tranfer speed via USB is FAST! If you use SoundJam on your Mac, the interface is right through that application.",tranfer speed,positive
"I think that this is one of the most used toys I own.  Great for taking in  my car to have a fresh sound every week. Great for taking for a jog or  working out in the gym (no skipping).  I only wish they included a ac  adapter plug. Plays music smooth and loud, great mp3 player!",sound,positive
"I have a 300 and now a 500. There are a few reasons this unit is a big improvement. Most impt is the USB connection, which makes uploading much faster and is conflict free. The software upgrades easily and the added memory capacity is thus doubled. If you download your songs at very high compression, sound remains good and capacity can exceed 3 hours. One suggestion: get real headphones!",memory capacity,positive
"I have used this model for 8 months and it has plenty of audio and video (including SVideo) inputs.  It can record and play S-VHS and VHS tapes,  with the former providing superior playback using the 2-hours recording  mode and an S-VHS tape.  It auto detects the tape type and has an easy to  use remote.  The best S-VHS machine in this price range.",remote,positive
"Esta camara la he comprado por que puedo grabar todas las fotos en discos flexibles, solo es cargar en el carro una caja de discos y tienes para cientos de fotos, una buena idea de la marca. Me ha gustado mucho y la he disfrutado mucho.",discos,positive
I just got the camera two days ago and have been tinkering with it ever since.  The macro mode alone makes this camera a worthy investment.  I do agree with others that the manual controls are a little tricky but I figure  if you manage to get a good picture then you earned it.  I have not been  disappointed yet by the quality.  Picked up 8 rechargeable batteries and a  64 mb card and I haven't looked back since.,picture,positive
"..this is good labeling tape.I've been using theBrother PT-70 labelerfor a while, and use the black-on-white labels as visual aids on electrical/data cabling connection points and to categorize the contents inside plastic storage containers.You don't really have a choice about the tape you use in any label maker; but this loads easily and stands up to the demands that come from occasional applications in demanding environments.Select with confidence for your PT-70/PT-90 labeler.",labeling tape,positive

This replacement labeling tape is for a low end Brother labeler. Amazon had best price and shipped quickly.,price,positive
This tape works fine for my label printer. The adhesive holds pretty well. It is not very flexible once you have it stuck on - I would not advise using it for labeling cables unless you use the &#34;flag&#34; method. I have noticed that if you leave the labels on something for an extended period of time it leaves a white residue behind if/when you remove them.,adhesive,positive
"Label tape works as advertised on Brother PT-90.  Just take the cover off of the back and insert cartridge.  It works wonderfully but I think that it's pretty sad that I paid more for the tape than I did for the whole labeler.  Regardless, I'm still very happy with the product.",Label tape,positive

"I use these labels and the associated base-model Brother label machine to tag plastic shoe boxes used to sort electronic and mechanical components.  They stick perfectly and stay for a long time (several years now and counting) without peeling up at the corners.  The print is high contrast and retains its color.  All told, a great quality label.",print,positive

Bought this to use for labeling binders and to label how much money remains on gift cards.The ribbon that prints seems to have been sitting on the warehouse shelf for too long. It partially prints each letter/number like some of the ribbon has gotten old and won't stick to the label. I would not recommend this product.,ribbon,negative

What I like about this labeling tape is the pre-cut line running along the back of the backing paper. It makes it very easy to remove the label from the backing paper when you're ready to stick the label.I did have one bad experience with loading this labeling tape in the past. The tape jammed upon installation and I had to throw out a new tape. You can avoid this by being careful during tape installation.,paper,positive

Haven't had a label come off yet (I've been use the label make for about a year).  Split backing makes taking the back off SOO much easier.  As for wasting the lead tape, I try to print several items together with one or two spaces between the items and then cut at the end--saves a little.",label,positive

It was good to find these labeling tapes at Amazon...at a good price.  They can be expensive in office supply stores.  Tape was in the original packaging and works fine. These Brother labeling machines come in handy for lots of labeling projects and this one is nice because it prints on clear tape.,tapes,positive

We use it inside, outside, in the heat and in the cold and on utensils that go in the dishwasher and it sticks without fail.",works,positive
I've been using this tape with my labelmaker for years and have been very happy with it. I went to Staples and ofcourse they were out of the black on clear so I went home and ordered on Amazon. I should have done that the first time!,tape,positive

Bought this to go with my old (about 10 years) Brother PT-85 P-Touch labeler. This one is black print on yellow tape to stand out against any color surface. Used it so far to label the drawers on my large rolling tool cabinet; easier than having to open numerous drawers while searching for tools. Fits and works perfectly. Nice to know I can still get these cartridges at a good price for this old printer.,cartridges,positive
This works perfectly in the Brother PT-70. The color is eye catching and the labels stick very well. Now I want to try the clear.,color,positive
"I like labeling things... boxes so I know what's in them, devices so I know what they're specifically for, warnings etc.  The great thing about this item is that there is no white strip to show what's there.

Compact - nice package.",package,positive
"Flexibility comes at a cost in performance and this is no exception. Good product, put together nicely and has tons of features. Minor annoyances: the clip behind the radio is not the best feature, the LCD light does not stay on long enough, and the speaker volume should be louder. Lots of upsides (well covered in other reviews) with some minor but annoying downsides.",features,positive
I use this in the car when driving long distances through major metropolitan areas - listen to the truckers discuss road conditions.  I can hear pretty good with this.  Talk power may be limited - even though I've got a good roof K40 antenna with a good SWS.  Acess to squelch and volume is is a little trickly while driving.

"Excellent value. Works great, easy to learn/operate. I have not used a CB Radio in years, so was impressed by the scan feature. 3 ways to power it, and auto adapter comes with external antenna connector, no need to buy adapter. Control buttons located handily, easy to navigate. Can recommend.",feature,positive
A nice little small radio that works well and and it took minimal effort to hook it up in our vehicle.,hook,positive
The only reason I did not give 5 stars was the lack of SSB on this unit. Otherwise is is exactly what I have been looking  for. Newer trucks don;t have all the extra room to mount toys like the older trucks did so this fits right on in.,room,positive

Full 4 watt power and weather channels.Has a extra battery pack and I NEVER thought I'd use the phrase: ""batteries NOT included"".You can plug it into the car 12VDC socket and use it with an external antenna, again NOT included. EZ 7-9 mile range with a decent antenna. About 2 mile range with the little antenna that comes with it.Worth the price!",price,positive
"I should have listened to everyone else reviewing this product.  Handhelds, including this one, are pretty useless without an external antenna.  Perhaps it was defective, but this one wouldn't even pick up a broadcast 50' in front of my truck.  Nonetheless, this would be a great value if it worked.  It includes a cigarette lighter adapter and two battery compartments.",external antenna,negative

"The radio works as advertised and I enjoy it very much.  The main reason I ordered it was because you can use it as a portable radio and as an in-auto cb.  With the external whip antenna it works excellent in the truck.  It also is a good price. If you read the specs and know what you are ordering, then you will not be sorry.",works,positive
"Nice radio that does everything I need it to do. Coupled with a Jeep mounted 4ft Firestik, the range is better than expected. Would highly recommend this CB.",range,positive
Works great. I pretty only use it out on the trail when I'm wheelin. I installed a 4' antenna gets much better reception and range. I like it because I can take it out when I'm done so less chance of someone stealing it. Also very easy to use,reception,positive

"Defective unit, scan function worked 1 out of 30. Battery trays are very poorly made. The eight battery compartment would not power the unit.

Audio was acceptable and it did bring in the NOAA clearly.",eight battery compartment,negative

However, the radio still transmits very well and receives well also. I continue to recommend it but I suggest purchasing an external speaker when you buy the radio.",transmits,positive

Hard to believe that you can get everything you need built in to the mic without having to mount a permanent unit under your dash.  Easily moved from car to car without tools and trouble, I highly recommend this to anyone needing a CB",money,positive
Purchased this cb from Best Buy.  It would not work with batteries or the power source in the vehicle.  Most difficult to get the battery pack open and off the cb in the beginning but once I made a call to the company I figured out that you must mash a button and slide the battery pack off the cb.  After going through that it didn't work.  I am sending it back and will not be reordering.,battery pack,negative
Ok - my first CB... I love this thing... so far so good. Good quality and looks durable. I did go buy an external antenna to boost reception ($15). I'll be testing this more this weekend when I go off-roading with a buddy and his CB. I recommend this.,quality,positive

I purchased this unit for a road trip cross-country. I was very disappointed with the quality. If I could return it at this point I would. Range is less than 1000 feet without an external antenna mounted to the vehicle. I've had other handhelds in the past with much better reception.,Range,negative

I just can't fathom how a dry tape can clean all that well. I also wonder how this can clean the record heads being that it never has you press the record button (probably doesn't clean the record heads is my guess) However it is by far the simplest to use!

This is an excillent head cleaner. There are visual graphics on the tape that talk you through the process & you get a little chart that you can stick on the tape case which shows that you can get 100 uses out of it.

Easy to use.  I would recommend this product over other products.  It was cheaper online than it was at the store.,use,positive

"I don't know why these outdoor speakers were so cheap; they replaced much larger speakers that eventually gave it up to the weather conditions, but the sound is even better. They are powered with a standard 50-watt Sonos receiver/amplifier unit, and still sound teriffic.  In fact, I like them so much that I'll probably take them down for the winter, to avoid having to replace them in a few years.",sound,positive
"For the cheap cheap price, these speakers work as good as needed and sound decent.  They do what they need to do and did I say they were cheap?!",sound,positive
"I bought these to mount under my deck for some outdoor tunes and they work great!  Sure they don't have the deep bass that you might expect from expensive indoor speakers, but at this price they do they job perfectly.  They have already been through several rain storms here in Georgia and continue to work fine.  Highly recommended!",work,positive
THESE SPEAKERS ARE GREAT!  THE HAVE HIGH QUALITY SOUND AND WORKED GREAT FOR MY COMPUTERS EXTERNAL SPEAKERS.  I LOVE THE QUALITY WHEN LISTENING TO MY CD'S,SOUND,positive
"I mounted them under my eaves and they work great.  I thought because they were so cheap that the sound would be cheap, but they sound great and have worked fine after a few rain storms.",work,positive
They do a good job. I put them below my deck and they have worked very wellfor two years. Great sound. I would buy them again. Great bargain for the price.,sound,positive
"dollar for dollar these are hard to beat !! every body was right about the brackets ,they are a little weakly made. mine are mounted inside our camper in the upper corners of the bedroom and sound much better than the old ceiling speakers.will buy another pair for the living area to replace the other pair of ceiling speakers out there. are a nice size for space avaiable.",sound,positive
"For a cheap pair of outdoor speakers these sound better than the price warrants, and lasted longer than I expected.",sound,positive
"I put this pair of speakers outside on the right side of my garage facing my backyard....and boy does it produce nice sound.  I placed it up under the roofline so it would stay a little drier.  I live in rainy Houston, we have had 4 or 5 heavy rainstorms and the speakers are still working just fine.  This pair was a great price, arrived very quickly, and sounds just fine.  Buy it and save money.",sounds,positive
"I bought this model because it was cheaper than the Sparkplug model in white with an L-shaped plug. Well, the straightness of the plug couldn't withstand normal use, and the audio stopped working because the junction between the wire and the hard part of the plug probably got bent back and forth too much. Good sound and sound-blocking, but not durable if you plan to move your MP3 player in and out of your pocket.",audio,negative
"Beautifully soft and comfortable, cone-shaped earphones, and the only ones I've ever found that don't keep falling out of my ears like earbuds do. Good sound quality, and excellent price, with the superb Koss reputation behind them.",price,positive
"I wanted to try these because I use my mp3 player in noisy environments, and they were supposed to be able to fit tightly into your ears and block the outside noise.  Well, I never was able to use them and finaly gave up on themn. I tried many times to squeeze the foam and hoped that they would mold to the shape of my ears, but it was never satisfactory.  I found them very uncomfortable.",them,negative
these plugs easily fall out regardless of what one of the three foam pieces you use. They are uncomfortable and hard to insert even if you follow the directions and suggestions here. I recommend the sony in earphones about $25,plugs,negative
Very comfortable. great tone and bass sounds. sound isolations is great!!!they are very affordable and i definitely recommend these for anyone who is looking for a great buy.,bass sounds,positive

"At this price point, you're not going to find a better pair of reasonably durable earbuds with this quality of sound or noise-canceling ability. I'd say that I've gone through a pair every few years, and I'll continue to buy these as needed. They block some sound, the sound quality is fine, and you won't be devastated when you realize that you've forgotten them on the plane and need to buy a new pair.",noise - canceling,positive
I've been using these buds for around a year now and have really enjoyed them.  They greatly reduce ambient noise and decrease conversational noise immensely.  I especially recommend these buds to those travelling in carpools or public transportation!,buds,positive
"Works fine as a basic set of earphones. However, the one-size-fits-all foam earplug doesn't quite fit right and pops out quite easily. Instead, move on and look for a set with rubber ""caps"" that they often ship with 2-3 different sizes - these fit better, stay put without fatiguing the ear.",foam earplug,negative
"I found these to be a waste of money and time. They didn't stay in my ears, I have very small ears, no matter how I tried I could not get them to fit properly, even the smallest cushion caused discomfort. The only thing they have going for them is that they are cute.",cushion,negative
I had a older version of this headphone that had the angle plug on it.And they lasted for 3 years. These new ones have a straight plug and lasted only 2 weeks before i had to replace them. If they go back to the angle plug i will buy these again. If you look at the photo you see the angle plug they changed it to a straight plug.,plug,negative
"No matter what sale or deal there is or how cheap it is, do not buy these earphones.I've purchased $8 headphones that were 1000 times better.I would not want these for free. Sound quality is crap.They're comfortable but that really doesn't matter if the sound is horrible.",Sound quality,negative
"Excellent price for a non audiophile. For me, sound is great and isolation is too. Nice snug fit. They tend to wiggle a but lose when I run so I use a headband to help hold them in. This works because they are so small and the headband doesn't make it feel like a vise.",sound,positive
They are very comfortable and fit nicely and securely in the ear canal. This fit is better than silicon earbuds. The sound quality I'd much better than any earbud in this price range.,ear canal,positive
"Just Super Sound coming form this small device. I use it when I travel on the airplane and discovered I don't need the bulky expensive noise canceling headphones. With the ear plugs nicely placed, all you hear is great sound, and its easy to carry around. Definitely recommend it.",carry,positive
"Good deal for the $.  The foam earplugs fit much nicer, especially if you have big old ear holes, like I do.This is my 3rd pair and I've liked all of them",foam earplugs fit,positive
"You will read reviews of this product talking about how quickly the foam plugs bounce back, and that you can't get them in your ears fast enough...Koss obviously made great improvements to the foam. THE FOAM IS NOW SLOW RECOVERY, meaning you can get it into your ear. This alleviates the only real downside to the product.",FOAM,positive
"These are OK earbuds as far as sound quality but not better than ones that came with my Zen-M. They are more durable than orgionals and stay in the ear better but they seem to take more volume to hear well and I find the sound quality on the Koss ""Spark Plugs"" much better.",sound,neutral
The horrible ear buds that came with my pricey MP3 player not only gave me an earache but were a pain in the neck to keep in place.  I could wear these little Koss plugs all day long and never know they're there.  And sound quality is perfect.,sound quality,positive
"These work for some people's ears and not for others. One reviewer claimed that I must be either retarded or deformed since they don't work for me. That reviewer is best described by words not allowed in this venue.I'm going to replace the useless foam, others have suggested:for hunters: Silencio Super Sound Baffler earplugsfrom a pharmacy: Flents &quot;Quiet Please&quot;I believe you have to create the center hole in these products to retrofit them to the Koss' &quot;stem&quot;.- Jeff",foam,negative
"Good sound isolation, too much bass for realistic sound, might be ok if you only listen to disco...very uncomfortable after about 30 minutes.",bass,negative
"this product is a great value. when coupled with the (2 Pair, Trilevel - Earphones Plus brand replacement ear cushions made to fit Klipsch, Shure, Etymotic and other models requiring a 2mm attachment diameter. Clear, Large) it makes these ear buds on par with higher cost phones.",value,positive
"Don't expect these to last for more than 3-5 months before one of the sides stop working.  Used them for ~1 hr a day 5 days a week for exercising, and they broke after 3 months.  Very poorly made, and $9 for a warranty replacement.",sides,negative
"I find these ear buds to be very comfortable, decent at sealing out surrounding noise and have decent sound.  One downside is that because the sound comes through a plastic straw-like tube, if you're opening your mouth (i.e. eating, yawning) the tube will pinch and the sound will become muffled, but this is only temporary.",sound,positive
I have bought these before and had the left ear plug go out after 5 months. Koss has a lifetime replacement guarantee so i returned them and after 7 months with my new ones the same thing happened. For the price its not bad but be warned you get what you pay for.,ear plug,negative
these are some of the worse headphones i have tested the sound is horrible and tiny using an ipod touch no bass what so ever. i guess i have not learnt my lesson sony seems to  have the best sounding headsets for this price range.,sound,negative
"These are great ear buds. If you squish the foam down and quickly put them in your ears, they expand and fit to your ears. Helps to block outside noises, and makes them comfortable. They feel secure and don't fall out if I'm moving around. Great for people who like to walk around with an ipod. Great bass, which is really important to me.",ipod,positive
"I wrote a long review about all the benefits of these eaplugs, but then I figured - I'm the jillionth person to review these.  I'm not sure I can add anything, so I'll make this quick:Cool earphones. Work great, cost nothing, totally camouflaged.Not sure?  Buy both kinds.Thank You",Work,positive
"Two of my kids have a problem with keeping ear buds in their ears, always being too big for them. They love KOSS 'THE PLUG' IN-EAR HEADPHONES because you can manipulate them into your ear cannel, fitting snug. The only drawback is your earwax tends to cling to them, so they will need to be cleaned.",fitting,positive
Good base and good sound. I buy one and usually send them back to Koss for $9 (lifetime warranty) when they crap out.  I'm a heavy user and use these virtually every day anywhere from 1.5- 7 hours/day.,sound,positive
I always get sore ears from the standard earbuds that iPods provide. I've got smaller-than-normal ears and the buds are really painful after a while. These Koss headphones are like little sponges that you squeeze when putting in. Then they expand to fit the exact size of your ear. Fantastic. They also have great sound. Definitely worth ordering.,sound,positive
"These have very good bass, although they don't sound as good as my Sennheiser CX300. The price is cheap so I mainly use it when I'm on the streets so, if someone steals it I wouldn't get very angry.",price,positive
"I have tried many brands but the koss have been my favorite for years, yes they die but I use them during workouts, runs, etc. I would say I go through about 3/year and think they are well worth it. I also have the gold kdx models (two), sent them for repairs and the customer service was nice...thanks",customer service,positive
"Didn't see that they were any better than other buds I have. Again, OK for the money. yo yo yo",money,neutral
"""The Plug"" offers VERY poor balance across the sound spectrum, they are very bass heavy/boomy, resulting in a very muddy sound. Unless you listen to your music with the bass turned ALL the way up, I suggest looking elsewhere.  Also, the acoustic tube is far too rigid and can scratch/gouge your ear canal.  Overall, a poor choice.",sound,negative
As a long time Philips HE592 user I was looking for something better or at least as good.  In a head-to-head comparision the results are clear.  The Koss require more power on the signal to create the sound (1.5-2x more).  The bass is jittery and the overall sound quality poor.  There is not nearly as much bass as the HE592.  Compared to the HE592 it sounds like you are listening to the playback through a metal can.,sound,negative
These are actually a replacement.  My first set lasted for a few year and needed another.  Best earbuds for the money hands down!,earbuds,positive
"I needed some earphones that would be more comfortable and louder than the cheap earbuds I had.  I'm very happy with these on both accounts, and as a bonus they are much cheaper than a lot of the other options.",cheaper,positive
These did not sound well at all and fit was even worse.  Ears got tired after just a few minutes during one song!,fit,negative
"I think these work great.  fit well, sound is just fine, and for the price, I've not found anything remotely in the same league.  I can only assume the part about tasting good, as I have not eaten them myself, but my cat has devoured several sets, so my presumption is, in a pinch, wouldn't make a half-bad snack.",fit,positive
"For me, these feel better and achieve a better seal than the norm.  A good seal is essential for achieving strong bass.  They are rated a little more efficient (the dB rating) than many of the others, and this was noticeable.",bass,positive
These earplugs fit well and sounded pretty good. Bass response wasn't that great but what do you want for the price?,fit,positive
"LOUD AS HELL! And sound proof to the world. You wont hear much past whats pumping through your headphones. Bass is nice and deep. Sharp sound. Not for anyone that doesn't like things in their ears. Best part, if you are a deaf fella like myself, you can pop the foam off of these and the tubes are the perfect fit for your old hearing aid in ear molds. Can get that perfect fit.",sound proof,positive
"these babies sound pretty sweet for $12! Don't waste your dough. Get these, and turn DOWN the bass on your iPod (set EQ to electronica), they'll sound frickin sweet!",sound,positive
"I now own three pair of these,  They are a bargain, as I have dozens of earbuds (mostly in ear) and their efficiency and sealability give a full rich sound.  The only pair I ever &#34;broke&#34;  was a pair that I sent through the wash TWICE!  You will spend at least 2-3 times their price to beat them.  One audiofile stated that he felt another set was much better (at $299.00)  Again, best value given their  price and performance.",performance,positive
"For a younger person with perfect hearing these might have less fidelity than others.  However, these are extremely comfortable.  The isolation from the outside noise is better than most other ear bud style phones.  And, they don't have the fall out problems associated with typical ear buds.  Koss, ""Sparkplug"" earphones are also worth consideration.  The Sparkplug model earphones sound about the same, but have a little higher profile out of ones ear.",isolation,positive
"I love these headphones and have been using them for years.  My kids (8 and 10) discovered them and now won't use any others.  They are very comfortable and block out outside sounds when you are using them.  Only downside is that they aren't very durable, but Koss give a lifetime warranty on them and you just have to pay for shipping to get them replaced.",warranty,positive
"The sound of it is ok but, the fit is terrible after a while of use they starting to hurt and itching inside the canal ear.",fit,negative
"Just bought these - they isolate sound, have very good high-end, are comfortable and stay in my ear (most ear buds fall out). I also bought a pair of the Coby CVE92 ear buds because I thought they'd fit as well. Sure enough they do, but they sound terrible in comparison. In addition, these have a lifetime ""no questions asked"" warranty - that's gold, my friend.",- end,positive
For the price you pay these are pretty good headphones.  Fit better than most in your ears and last FOREVER.  Not the best you will find but for listening to books or music on walks or traveling they work perfect.,Fit,positive
"I like how the foam plugs conform to your ear, but if you want them in tight - like for running - and you don't get them wedged in just right, the foam will squeeze shut and block the sound.",foam plugs,positive
"Try to get the metallic silver and purple in color koss plug earbuds as the sound is phenomenal for the price. I had a fairly expensive pair of sony earbuds that were around $40.00 and one channel crapped out after about 6 months. hard to believe, but the koss plug earbuds sound way better then the more costly sony. go figure.For the price and the sound, these earbuds can't be beat. good going Koss.",sound,positive
"Better than I could have hoped. They are comfortable, sound great and are an incredible deal from one of the best names in sound. Makes my iPod Touch the music machine I always wanted.",iPod,positive
"these headphones to me are my favorite, after you get used to squeezing them and setting them up correctly in your ear. they reduce outside noise and sound great with bass. plus when you workout or mow the lawn you dont have to turn up your music as loud with other headphones, this is very nice with big yards and helps keep your hearing from getting damaged.",sound,positive
"I like these, they sound good, are priced reasonable, block out all other sound. My only complaint is that I cant find the soft replacement ear buds. I have purchased ones that are said to be replacements but they seem harder & are not as easy to roll. Think I will need to buy a new pair in order to get the soft ones.",priced,positive
The ear buds make nice ear plugs.  I wear them at work to block out noise. Sound quality is good but not the best.  They came with 3 different sized buds.  I think they are a good value for the price.,price,positive

"The product works as advertised, and is very simple to use. I am using it to control the volume on an external speaker connected to a Spirit Box for use in investigations for my paranormal research group.",use,positive
Doesn't have much range. This definitely decreased the volume in my headphones. It works as a volume control but it shouldn't decrease the volume to do so.,range,negative

"Works as advertised, well worth money spent Koss makes great products for the home or car, so if you want or need a volume control then this one is for you!",volume,positive
"The volume controller is reasonably well designed; no crackling drop out of volume, or other distortion during use.  It's ergonomics allow it to feel good in either hand.

"I would have liked to see a larger dial that offers more levels, but if you need a simple volume control than this is the one.",volume control,positive
"Performs as advertised. Some people have noted a drop in audio quality, but to a person with average ears such as mine, your audio should sound almost exactly the same. The price is definitely fair.The one problem I've encountered so far is that the volume dial is recessed from the side, so I have to use my fingernail to turn it. But it's only a minor annoyance since the product works.",price,positive
"Purchased to be used to adjust the volume of my Pro 4AAT phones while snoozing at night, the tiny volume control, no balance, and flimsy construction make these useless for me.At $10, not worth the hassle of returning.Koss should not put their name on such a piece of junk. Next time, I'll pay more and buy something better.",volume control,negative
It was bought in case I had issues hearing from a pair of earbuds that I bought and it works great.,works,positive
"If you have a device that allows for headphones, but doesn't have a volume adjustment, this is for you.I've been using this to ""tone down"" the audio that is sent from my Xbox 360's audio dongle. The volume control has lasted well since the purchase, with no visible signs of wear, in spite of being used while traveling. Also, the sound quality is pretty good, with no detectable leakage.I would greatly recommend this.",volume control,positive
"Good quality, no impact on audio quality.The wheel is small and recessed.  Maybe it was designed like this to prevent inadvertent movement if the device is in a pocket, etc.  But it kinda defeats the purpose of having an inline control if you're gonna stick it in your pocket.  Anyway, the a larger wheel or more open access would be an improvement.",audio quality,positive
I bought this to be able to control audio volume.  Similar devices of other brands/no brands purchased in the past all just disintegrated; Koss is built much better and so far so good.  No complaints.,built,positive

"Does exactly what it should. I use it with a Blue Tooth receiver to work as wireless headphones with a set of ear buds.

"This is a surprisingly useful gadget, as it serves as an extension cord and volume control. The extension cord aspect adds about 3 feet to your headphone, which gives me a lot more room to move when I am listening to music on my computer. The volume control is handy when using a portable player because you can change the volume without jostling the player.",volume control,positive

Aside from that, it does work pretty well.",volume,positive
"This is a handy and inexpensive little device.  A convenient way to ""tweak"" your volume level.  Works fine. No complaints.  Like all headphone cables it doesn't like to be rolled over by chair rollers, stomped on or yanked out of the socket.  If you treat it with moderate care, it ought to last for years.",volume,positive
This Koss is very good one for volume control. There is no noise sound when I adjust volume. I can't distinguish whether I plug my headphone with this Koss because it has no effect to my head phone at all. I use HD555 which has 50 ohms impedance so I think this Koss may reduce some power of my headphone. But not at all. My HD555 still provides great sound. I love it.,sound,positive

"Very good volume controller and very useful, have it on my PC works with any head phones, does the job it was made for and works great.",volume controller,positive
I purchased this volume control simply to give my headphones an extension cord.  Being able to adjust the volume is an added bonus.,volume control,positive
"After less than a month of being attached to my laptop, the volume control started introducing static, and suddenly it was as if the control was turned all the way down, no matter what I did with the volume wheel.",volume control,negative
"I think every pair of headphones should have built-in volume control, but a lot of them don't, so this bit of kit is needed.  They work just as expected with no degradation to the sound quality.",sound quality,positive
This volume control is just what I needed to control the volume for headphones I own without a volumecontrol.  The control is simple and the volume changing is continuous and smooth.,volume control,positive
"I have bought two of these, one for myself and another for a gift.  I like having the thumb wheel volume control handy to raise and lower volume while watching movies on my pad.  It is a very solid product!",thumb wheel volume control,positive
"Developed a short in the jack after 2 uses.  Sound was fine until then, now its a constant struggle to get the plug situated so that there is no static.",plug,negative
"Im very happy with this extention. Not only does it giveme the extra length to use it for remote viewing thru my PC from bed, it is very convenient for volume I have complete Privacy and Control of my utube and Netflix viewing late at night, I wasnt sure but it turned out to be a Great Buy.",extention,positive
"It works as advertised, it's nice and small and adds a little length to your existing headphone cord. Mine doesn't look exactly like the one pictured (it's more squared off than rounded) but no big deal, I'm still pleased with it and do recommend it.",works,positive
"This on-line volume control works good, no issues so far. I recommend it for anyone that owns headphones lacking volume control.",- line volume control,positive
This works great. I have a MP3 player that I use when I am riding and it makes it easier to adjust the volume. Fast shipping.,shipping,positive
I have a Koss Headphone but leaning back in my chair was not quite long enough plus the volume control is very handy to make a quick volume control when needing to make quick volume controls as well as getting some more space.  The quality is very good with the headset and volume control.,volume control,positive
It's so convenient having a volume control for my earphones.  I use this when watching my TV since there is no volume control for the earphone connection.  I may order another one for use with my iPod so I won't have to dig it out of my purse to adjust the volume.,volume control,positive
"This is a great companion to my JVC noise cancelling headphones.  I don't really need the extra length while traveling, but at home the added range and direct volume control is a big plus.",range,positive
"The volume control degraded the sound quality significantly. If you use it with a cheap earphone, it may be OK for you, definitely not enevn with Koss PortaPro or KSC75.",sound quality,negative
"I use this with my Bluetooth headphones the volume control is great which Is what looking for in this product, the extra cable length is a bonus.",cable length,positive
"The cable is thin, but appears to be a high quality. Connectors are well built.The volume control is easy to use, and will let you fine tune the volume to any lower volume.",volume control,positive
I love having a volume switch available no matter what headphones I use.  Also the cord is long enough to work as an extension. I've always enjoyed Koss products; the quality of sound from their headphones just sounds better to me than most-- especially for the price.,quality of sound,positive
"PortaPro headphones did not dissapoint.  Sound was good, and a good alternative to in ear headphones.",Sound,positive
Well this product has absolutely exceeded my expectations in terms of the overall sound quality .. . And for the price that its offered. . .i can recommend any one to just buy it .. without thinking twice. ..Cons :  Not as comfortable as over the ear headphones. ..,sound quality,positive
"I had a Koss CD player when I was little, and the bass was unmatched in a bookshelf system.  It made me the envy of my friends and translated into loyalty with KOSS headphones.  I can't say enough about these lightweight, gorgeous-sounding, funky headphones.  PortaPros have a lifetime warranty, look like something out of Tron, and spoil the listener with comfort and bass reproduction.  Buy 'em, and find something else to worry about, in life.  Highly recommended.",comfort,positive
"These headphones have been the companion to my laptop since the day I bought them. They are small, light, and deliver surprisingly good sound for the size.On the negative size, the foam ear pads can fall off very easily, and have a relatively short life. The sliders that adjusts the tension in the band move to max tension at the slightest touch.",sound,positive
"I purchased these headphones looking for a set of sub-100 dollar on-ear phones.  Like many other reviews say, the sound quality is superb for the price range.  my only complaint is the comfort.  i don't wear them on a daily basis, and they are slightly difficult to get accustomed to.  other than that, this is a top notch product.",sound quality,positive
"Good product for the cost. Good sound quality, folds easily and can be used a variety of settings. Nice price",sound quality,positive
"I usually use ear buds, or speakers, but I thought I would try these. The bass and the sound response in general are quite good. They are seemingly flimsy, or should I say, light weight, but I have been pretty hard on them and they are still in one piece. I would recommend them over similarly priced ear buds, so long as the style appeals to you.",sound response,positive
"I've been using these headphones for over a year now and they're simply excellent.I know some have an issue with the style, but all I really care about is the sound quality.It's terrific.",sound quality,positive
"Stop looking and just get these. They don't feel as comfortable as some other headphones, but they sound great!I love the retro look too.",sound,positive
"I liked these headphones, pretty much what I paid for.  The metal band on the top grabs hair sometimes if you adjust it on your head... so just don't do that and you'll be good.Good sound, fairly comfortable.  Essentially just what I wanted.",sound,positive
"They are collapsible, comfortable, they have great sound quality (good bass), and they come with a lifetime warranty. How can you not buy these?",sound quality,positive
"I bought the Sennheiser PX200 and returned them since they hurt my head (7 3/4 hat size). These headphones sound better, (better range and low end), fit better, and cover more of my ears.  Solid value.",low end,positive
"That's about it, really honest headphones, cheap and the sound is quite balanced. Headband pressure adjustable (firm / light). I find the firm a bit too tight but it's a good setting when being active. Totally recommend.",sound,positive
"These are simply the best headphones that you can purchase for an under $100 price tag, and they are under 50$! Very full, clear, sound with an amazing amount of bass. The styling isn't the greatest in my opinion, but the amazing sound quality more than makes up for it.",sound,positive
"Work well and easy to use.  The cord is to short, but the sound, build quality, and weight are are outstanding.  These headphones excel in these most important areas.  I will constantly pick them over a more expensive heavy set.",build quality,positive
i bought these because they looked kooky.  they sound good and they're foldable but they're not as comfy as i imagined.  they hurt after an hour or so.,sound,positive
"I've had these for a while, haven't used them much and then have begun to do so with library books on CD. Okay to good sound, but the durability isn't great --- one of the ear pieces constantly comes off. It can be re-placed, but it's a nuisance.",sound,positive
"Seriously, are these airplane headphones?  That's how poor I found the sound quality in these.  I was shocked after seeing all the great reviews for these and then after finally checking them out for myself, wow, what a let down.  They do look cool but even the $5 Skullcandy earbuds with poor sound quality sounds better than these.  I cannot believe this is Koss, I have owned numerous headphones by them but this is just sad.",sound quality,negative
"The earphones are fine, but they create too much pressure physically on the skull (ears).  They don't just sit, they squeeze onto your ears.  Definitely a minus for me.  Maybe I'll get used to them, but so far I feel it was a bad call.",call,negative
"I bought these after Shure jacked up the price of their mini headphone from $30 to $90 (huh?).  Anyway, these sound just fine and are comfortable.My only complaint is how each side of the head band is connected together, that if I adjust it while on my head, my hair can get caught under the band.  Yoowwwzaaaa!  I don't have long hair, so I would imagine it would be even worse for those people.",sound,positive
"Great sound, time proven stats and abilities. Check out reviews elsewhere, I did, these are the best quality for the price.",sound,positive
"These sound amazing, hands down the best under fifty you can buy. Not as stylish as some or even as durable but with a lifetime warrenty you can't go wrong. 4.5",warrenty,positive
"Best sounding open ear headphones I've ever heard. I've used them almost every day for a long time. Bass is very powerful for something that doesn't enclose the ear. Sound is very clear and they can also handle a lot of power. As others have said, the headband can rip out a few hairs occasionally, but that is the only complaint I have.",Sound,positive
"These are great headphones for the money.  I wish the cord was a little longer as I use them at my desk.  The sound is far better than I've found with others in this price range, so it's a reasonable trade-off for me.  The lifetime guarantee doesn't hurt, either.",lifetime guarantee,positive
There's not much I can add to what's already been said about the Koss PortaPro headphones. These have got to be one of the best values out there today. Sound is phenomenal. Comfort (for me) is very good. The only area for concern that I could see was the quality of the cable/jack. I added two layers of shrink tubing at this junction to relieve stress. I think that will be sufficient. Highly recommend this product.,Sound,positive
The 'gold' plug on these earphones is slightly smaller than regulation which causes the right earphone to cut out on some devices.  I bought TWO of these puppies and they are both defective.  The problem does not show up until they have been used for some hours (weeks).,earphones,negative
I use to own these same headphones back in the 80's and they are still dynamic!  I would recommend these headphones to anyone!,headphones,positive
"Do you wanna look like a jogger from 1982?  Do you want your music to sound fantastic at the same time?  These are your headphones.  Seriously, they sound excellent.",music,positive
"If you love the bass in the music, this is your headphones! This is a real killer with high expression of basses, high quality sound, good noise-blocking, comfy (but you probably will feel uncomfort in an hour, it causes sweating and heating in ears after some time), light-weighted and in contrast to style arguments of other reviews, pretty stylish with its blue color and metal connection.I strongly recommend the product. Especially given its price...",connection,positive
Very deep bass for such little headphones needs a break in period top of head set can be a little uncomfortable in extended use other than that great value,value,positive
Ha widths years ago.Design looks a bit lighter than back then but has added fit switch (tight or loose) which is nice.As ever great sonice and the price I got it for ($25!!!) was a steal.Great choice for comfortable home use and moderately active outdoor performance!!!!!!!!,home use,positive
"If comfort is your issue, these headphones do the job. I have very sensative ears. These heasdphones direct the pressure away from your ears and it is much more evenly distributed than any headphones I've tried (besides my super expensive noise cancelling headphones.",comfort,positive
Most cheap headphones claim they can reproduce bass down to 20 Hz but these are the only ones that even come close to matching that claim. The clarity and durability of these headphones is also amazing.,clarity,positive
I have owned a pair of Koss Porta-Pros back when they first came out and could not believe the sound from these headphones. I have tried other brands but have never had as good of a frequency response that these headphones can produce. I will never buy any other pair of over the ear headphones as long as they keep these in production. They are that good.,response,positive
"I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.",Sound,positive
They look old school but these things are awesome. I bought the replacement pads too but haven't had to use them yet. The sound quality is amazing and you don't lose anything like you sometimes do with noise canceling headphones.,sound quality,positive
"I think these are great for the price, but they lack low end bass as they are compact, and the padding simply isn't there, to keep space to a minimum once again, but overall, I'm very much happy with them. Keep an eye out for a video review on the SonicOrbStudios YouTube channel for more :)",price,positive
"You notice more sounds with these headphones.  This is one example of traditional electronics that will never be beat, especially at this price.",sounds,positive
"Sure these headphones look a bit wierd. A matter of taste at best.However the sound is great! Whether the source is a smartphone, tablet or PC this is an excellent sounding headphone for the price.",price,positive
"For the price, there is simply no other set of headphones that will provide as warm and beautiful a soundspace. It's that simple.",soundspace,positive
"I have been wanting a great set of headphones for years and finally took the time to research them and checked with C-net before I purchased anything. I am so glad that I got these, they are so very comfortable (even with brand new ear piercings) and sound incredible. I am also very happy to find out they have a lifetime warranty.",warranty,positive
My daughter didn't have a nice pair of headphones and we looked these up on Amazon and Cnet loved them so for Christmas I bought them for her. SHE LOVES THEM &#60;3,headphones,positive
"How often can you really ""feel"" the music? Well, now that is possible with the Porta pro from Koss. Just got mine and they are incredible. Amazing is too short to describe the experience. Highly recommended.",music,positive
"Suits my needs almost perfectly.  A great balance of quality construction, design, price and sound.  All that and a life time warranty from a company with a solid reputation.  I love these headphones.",construction,positive
"You really can't beat the sound of the headphones for the price. They fit really well, sound amazing, look sweet and rival higher end headphones. I am going to pick up a set for work and home. Even though they are portable, I still forget them. :)",fit,positive
"I own several pairs of headphones and earbuds, ranging in price from $20 to over $500.  I've had a pair of these Koss PortaPro headphones for several months now, and used them on PCs for games and on an iPhone and an iPad for games, music and video.  These headhones have great sound with all the devices.  I like them so well that I just ordered 2 more pair.  It would be hard to beat them for the price.",sound,positive
"I purchased these after reading many reviews and was not disappointed.  They do not have the best high range, but decent.  Great mid range and surprisingly good low end for the size and style.  They performed so well, that my 16 year old nephew ended up confiscating them as his.  When I called him out on the retro style, he shrugged and said &#34;have you heard these?&#34;  Enough said!",size,positive
"The sound of these cans is good but there are others that are its equal that have some better ergonomics.  The ergonomics are good once you get them on, but the headband and the ""Tension Adjustment"" for the earpads are fiddly.  I find that the Sennheiser PX-100 or the AKG K420 offer equal performance with better usability and similar comfort.",usability,positive
"Comfortable, sturdy, & decent sound. I certainly would buy other Koss products & I rec'd this one for those of us who can't wear those uncomfortable ear buds.",sound,positive
"Outstanding bass while keeping everything else clean, at an incredible low price; and confortable !",bass,positive
"For the cash you can't get better. Plus: clear sound, low power consumption, comfy pads Minus: not really collapsible, hard to adjust firmness buttons, hair gets caught in band (and I have very short hair). Mated with Cowon's I7, you'd think a fortune was spent for the amazing sound. Not suggested for devices lacking a graphic equalizer-- top treble can get harsh without modification with higher volumes. Glad I purchased the oldie but goodie.",power consumption,positive
"Yep. An old classic. No styling changes for 20-plus years. But they got it right the first time. Very lightweight and excellent sound. I use Grados for my serious listening, but these are just super for portable use. Probably why they call them 'PortaPro.' Only complaint, the top band is a little tweeky and thin. A wider band would render these bad boys perfect. Can't do better for the bucks though. Happy listening!!!!!",sound,positive
"So I was in the market for a great pair of phones. Was looking at some grados, but they are pricey. So when I found these I was a bit surprised at the specs to cost ratio. Must say the look and feel great, and the sound quality is just fantastic. Would definitely recommend!",sound quality,positive
"These are comfortable and deliver great sound and the cost is reasonable.  I also own the Sennheiser PX100 which also sound great and are comfortable, but cost twice as much.  The Sennheisers fold down a bit smaller, but it's not a big difference.  The Koss Portapro is definitely a good quality product.  Good reviews from the audio experts, too.",sound,positive
Definitely one of the best sounding headphones under $50! Well worth the money. Just that it might pinch your hair.,headphones,positive
"Pretty good sound, I like more bass and these are balanced.  Ipod touch powers them just fine.",sound,positive
Everyone is surprised by the awesome sound when I have them listen to these. I use them regularly at the office as well as when I travel. They collapse well for travel.,sound,positive
These are not what I expected based on the reviews I read & price paid.  They are on the flimsy side IMO & do not sound any better than most other cheaper & flimsy headphones I've tried.  If I had to do it over again & would have spent more & bought some Grados.,sound,negative
"use it all the time on the subway.  it's been used for over 2 years.  just becareful of rolling up the cord.  after a while it could lose some of it's connectivity at the head socket if your'e too rough with it, but luckily it has a lifetime warranty.",warranty,positive
"I have had a pair of Koss PortaPro headphone since they came out about 20 years ago.  They are the best. I believe they were once top-rated by CU.  They have wonderfull bass, clear sound, are comforable to wear.  They are low priced.  They have a life-time warrenty for $6 S&H repair or replacement by Koss.  How may other headphones have this?  You will be very happy with the PortaPro.",warrenty,positive
Simply the best inexpensive headphone on the market. Hard to believe they first appeared 20+ years ago and they still can't be beat.,headphone,positive
"The space between the speaker and the temple rest is too small and it hurts the ears.If you have big ears or a big noggin, don't get these.",temple rest,negative
This is the second pair of Koss Porta Pros I have purchased (wire started shorting out after a few years of repeatedly dropping my ipod). Sound quality is great for the price.  They are comfortable to wear.  What more can you expect.,quality,positive
"Better sound than I expected for the price I paid. They collapse easily, take up little space, and I don't have to shove them in my ears, which is nice.",sound,positive
"See title.  Both my wife and I love these, they fit nice, very nice price, look reasonably durable, and the sound range is everything I can hear.  What's not to like?",price,positive
"This is my favorite headset to use around the house. Pros: Light weight, collapsible, adjustable band, good sound, comfortable to wear. (i get tired of using my in-ear phones). It is not noise isolating but i like being able to hear my surroundings.",wear,positive
Really nice pair of low cost ear phones that do a very decent job. If youu do'nt want to spend a lot of money you get your monies worth with this set.,ear phones,positive
"My first PortaPros came with a Koss FM radio I bought in the mid-80s. They never wore out, outlasting the radio by more than a decade, and I eventually misplaced them.  I was thrilled to discover they're still available after all these years.  They're comfortable and durable, and they sound great.  Lifetime warranty, too. Very few products these days avoid obsolescence for a quarter century. The Koss PortaPros are tried and true, and still relevant. Imagine that.",sound,positive
The build quality seems cheap and all but the sound quality is pretty good. The little pouch that came with it seems nice.,sound quality,positive
this is a decent headphone it works without issue and the wires seem to be thick enough not to bend and break leaving only 1 side working. however since i wear glasses they seem to be a little tight for extended use however if you can remove them for awhile every couple of hours then i would definetly recomend these especially at less than $50,headphone,positive
we have two pair for now over a year and they are well made and easy to store away in a purse-,made,positive
"This Koss Model received overall very good reviews.  I can understand why, they sound full, open  and music sounds great.  Also comfortable, although I have not worn them for an extended time.  I would recommend  if one uses them hooked up to a cell phone make sure the mike is relatively close to your mouth.  Others may have a difficult time hearing you.  Very please!",music,positive
I have this for 3 years now and I still use it for my everyday use. It is strong and sounds great better than a lot of my more expensive headphones. Too bad people care more about aesthetics then the actual quality if things anymore.,sounds,positive
"The Koss PortaPro Headphones work for me as earbuds don't stay in place.  I use them while on the treadmill and they stay in place and provide good sound quality.  So far I haven't experienced any problems, I have had them over a month.",sound quality,positive
"I purchased these headphones for a recent overseas trip.  I used these headphones on the flight to and back from Europe and they proved to be excellent for both music as well as movies.  If you can live with the design, these headphones are hard to beat for a reasonable price.",music,positive
"I was skeptical that these would provide such a good sound, but they really do sound as good or better than high end headphones.",sound,positive
"Porta pros have been around for decades in various models and there's a reason they've been so successful. It's because they sound so good!  I've had several versions of these since the late 70s, and never been disappointed. Get some, you'll be glad you did.",sound,positive
"I have owned these for two years now, and use them almost every day.  They are light, comfortable, and easy to carry in my bag.  I have recommended them to several family members who are also delighted with them.  The sound quality if very good for the price, and in fact, better than some that cost two or three times as much - as I have discovered to my regret!  I highly recommend these.",carry,positive
"I just got these in the mail today. I wanted something cheap with decent quality. The sound quality from these headphones is amazing. I can't attest to the durability of them since I just got them, but wow, the sound is crystal clear with great highs and lows and no distortion. They are kind of dorky looking though.",lows,positive
"It is absurd that these are so cheap. They sound basically as good as pro studio headphones. Totally effortless, full range of sound that is completely clear. And since they are open, you can still hear things around you, so you don't walk around with that sensory-deprived ""living in a cloud, disconnected from the world"" feeling.Also they're totally comfortable. Cannot go wrong with these.",range,positive
"I find them comfortable enough. They are also small and light. They do sound fine to me, but I am not a great judge of that anymore. However, there is one annoying thing, the short cord. I am sure that's all in the eyes of the beholder, but that's how I feel.",sound,positive
"I needed a set of headphones that was small enough to take with me wherever I go. These deliver surprisingly punchy trebels and mids. The bass could be stronger, but is not at all shabby for other headphones in this price range. Love the retro look. The foldability makes them ideal for my laptop bag and workout bag.",look,positive
These are great sounding headphones ! They are little hard sometimes to resize for your head but the sound is stellar for the price.,sound,positive
"Everything the the other reviewers said seems to be true.  Much, much better sound and more comfortable than the &#34;standard ear-buds&#34;.  I flew 10 hours back to the US from Germany, after watching 4 movies, they are immensely comfortable.  They do catch your hair when removing or adjusting them.  Very nice sound for an under $30 set of headphones.  The lifetime warranty was the final clincher for me.",warranty,positive
"These headphones work great. I use them with my Ipod touch and my laptop. They are light, extremely comfortable and have excellant sound. Tough to beat for the cost, and the Koss warrenty is the best. Highly recommend.",sound,positive
"These things have been around forever because they sound great. Sure, they look funny but if you're just chillin' at home, do it!",look,positive
"I am not an audiophile by any means, but the PortaPro headphones are exceptional.  The sound is, especially in lieu of the minimal cost of the unit, clear with a more than adequate amount of bass.  As a bonus, the comfort level when wearing these headphones is wonderful.  Bottom line...a funky looking set of headphones that deliver a powerful and enjoyable experience.  Try them...you'll like them!!",comfort level,positive
"I've had these for a few months now and I'm very satisfied. Great sound quality, very comfortable, and very durable compared to the plethora of plastic dominating the market. So 5 stars from me!",sound quality,positive
"The portapro has very good sound and base,but the temple pads and metal hooks hurt my big ears,so I sent them back to amizon-Expo. The seenheiser px-100s also sound very good,but not quite as good as the portapros.I do like the px-100s because they are very comfortable.easy to use and are very well made and fold up better than the potapros,but Im still looking for a better headphone.",use,positive
"Best bucks I've ever spend on a portable headphone... Glad I didn't go with Bose AE2... this sounds just as good, just as comfortable, and 1/5th of the cost... Heck, best money I've ever spend on a headphone.Also love the open-ear design, I can finally hear people talking with me at work now :)",design,positive
"I was on the verge of buying Bose headphones but the price bothered me. I read at least 50 reviews from different sources and decided to buy Koss plus my picky sister said they were good. I'm pleased, they sound great and the price is right.",sound,positive
"Works Great if you're not planning on getting sweaty, Sounds fine for the money compared to the price of the XtremeMac  class of Ear/Headsets on the market.",Sounds,positive
"I own two pairs of these headphones and gave my son a 3rd pair for Christmas. Great sound, lightweight enough to go jogging with or wear around the house while doing chores. Unlike earbuds, they stay in place. They are not indestructible- if you accidentally step on them, you will break them. But they do hold up just fine with normal wear and tear.Highly recommended.",sound,positive
"I've had a history with Koss, and they provide such amazing sound quality!Two tips:1. Take care of them or they will get destroyed.2. Try to keep them in your room (or they will get destroyed).",sound quality,positive
"It has an amazing bass and great sound quality, adding a great price you get an amazing product (the bad thing is that ii could be a little uncomfortable if you have a big head).",sound quality,positive
They sound every bit as good as my ear-surrounding headphones.  I find them much more comfortable than the now popular ear-buds.  I think they are stylish -- Geek style.,sound,positive
"They are clear, crisp, and have just the right amount of bass.  You can't ask for any better sound from this style of headphone.  I have actually made a couple friends very angry when I told them to try my headphones, then ask what they cost, and then complain that they sound better than their $300 Sennheisers........",bass,positive
"Great highs, mids and lows, for a $35.00 headphone you cannot go wrong... period. I have the Sennheiser px100 and may like these even more. More life and dynamics.",mids,positive
The headphones work quite well.  They don't feel like great headphones but they have held up pretty well and produce good sound.  I use them on the treadmill as I don't like in ear headphones and they have held up well considering all of the sweat that has gone into them.,sound,positive
This must be the 10th pair of headphones I've purchased in the last 5 years.  But I've finally found the one.  I read the other reviews and went with this one based on the quality of sound.  And it's great!  I am amazed at how much bass these things produce!  They also fold up well and clip together.  It should be easier to find the cord around them but that's just a minor annoyance.,quality of sound,positive
"i bought these over a year ago hoping that a company offering a lifetime warranty would provide a product that would last; i'm on my third pair. when they work, they are ok, but every 6 months the sound quality becomes so painfully bad i send them back. i suggest throwing your money elsewhere.",sound quality,negative
"We have a split family, and so it's great to have amazingly clear headphones that can fold up, that they love and move easily between homes without getting damaged. Great purchase!",headphones,positive
"Impressive set for the money, but obviously not professional quality. It does indeed catch hair and can hurt to pull off at times. If you want a good cheap headset, this is an impressive option for the price range it's in.",set,positive
"Pros- Great Sound!!, Portable, Incredibly Comfortable, they just look coolCons- Not so durable, cord feels cheapI saw these on CNET as some of the best headphones along with ones that cost 100's of dollars and thought I'd give them a try.  I am not disappointed, they look great and sound even better.  They fold up to a small size too and can fit in your pocket.  They even come with a nice leather carrying pouch.",pouch,positive
"I had a pair when I was in college back in the mid '70s and they were tops then.Great sound hi and low...not for deep mega bass as it will not carry the bass punch. All others...get your KOSS on and enjoy comfortable headphones that are lightweight and custom fit to your ears and head for rich, full sound.",fit,positive
"I may not be a audiophile, but these headphones sound great! I was surprised by the deep bass in this headphone. Some may be put off by it, but I personally enjoy it. Don't be fool by the picture of the Portapro. They are quite thin and small when collapsed. These are definitely not headphones that you should be bouncing around in since it is so flimsy. Overall, for the price, these are great sounding headphones for the price",price,positive
"I wanted a pair of headphones that were lightweight, convenient to carry in my daily-use sling bag, and offered decent sound while being affordable. This set meets all of my criteria and I'm very pleased with them.",sound,positive
"These earphones have been around a long time for a reason. Although not as clear as Bose noise-canceling earphones, you cannot beat these earphones for the money. They work very well with an iPod. The bass is especially good, and the music itself is a lot more precise than with the normal iPod earbuds. These earphones are well worth the money.",music,positive

Finally I did and I am very happy I did.Sound is the best I have heard from this size headphones and it is also much more comfortable than I first thought it would be.I cannot tell how it looks, since I am wearing it. But who cares if the sound is so good.",Sound,positive
"My girlfriend swears that these are the best headphones she's ever had. Call me crazy, but I feel as though they're starting to sound better than my Grado SR-80s too.",headphones,positive
they work well and seem very strong. more than enough length on the cord and extremely great sound.,cord,positive
Surprising good sound for the money. These things sound too good to be used for workouts. They have foam earpads and those thing will get nasty with sweat. I use these at work and I couldn't be happier with them.,sound,positive
Who woulda guessed that the best sounding headphones under $100 would be a portable version?,headphones,positive
Excellent sound for the money. I only got to use them for a short time and wife discovered them. She loves them and won't give them back.,sound,positive
"I got these to replace my 4 yr old Senn px 100 which suddenly got broken at the miniplug, these are not as comfortable as the Px 100 but they do sound great and give you more bass because they are tighter against your ears but with an offer from another site which ended costing me just $5.00 i could not pass them up. They're also very sensitive which makes them ideal for Ipods and other portable devices.",sound,positive
"These headphones are some of the best I've ever had!  Sound quality and comfort are excellent.  Where have they been all my life?  If you are considering purchasing these headphones don't hesitate, just do it.  They are well worth the money!",Sound quality,positive
"My dad has had them for 10 years, they still work as if they were new. My bro has them, I've had them for a year... And have gotten 4 people to get them too.Nothing beats them, period. They deliver an incredible sound performance, feel great, don't leak too much, isolate a fair amount of surrounding noise, are unbreakable and extremely portable.Get them with no hesitation.",sound performance,positive

"These are outstanding headphones for the price, with excellent response across the frequency spectrum, and especially robust bass for such a small, lightweight set.  A friend recently visited me with a just purchased set of large, over-the-ear type headphones.  Though his cost nearly three times as much he was chagrined to find, after listening to a comparison, that the Koss headphones sounded better. A lifetime guarantee never hurts, either.",guarantee,positive
"I wear glasses and am very picky about over the head headphones. This one has nice design with support at the temple to relieve pressure at the ears, so doesn't push on the frame. Sound isn't bad either. I use it at office and when i go out for walks during the day and it feels comfy for extended periods of use.",design,positive
"After reading a very positive review of these headphones in Computer Shopper Magazine I decided to buy three for use in my workshops and classes.I like their light weight, compactness, and great sound quality. Over time they may not take the abuse some of my students will subject them to. For now I am very pleased with them.",compactness,positive
"Got a couple of these for $25 each and my wife and I use them to watch Netflix and such. They are very good for what they are. Comfortable: secure without being tight. Easy to fold up for protection. Open phones make it possible for us to make comments to each other while watching (not possible with higher quality earbuds we have.) Especially if you find them at this price, go for it!",protection,positive
"I adore these headphones. They are definitely the best portable/lightweight headphones I have used. Amazing frequency response across the entire range. Very comfortable, even if you're wearing glasses. The lifetime warranty is a big plus too.",frequency response,positive

"Not even sure writing a review can do these headphones justice, exceptional; is the first word that comes to mind. These are not just good for the price, they are just good. There is always a satisfying feeling I get when I feel like I received more than I payed for, and that is exactly what I received here. Very highly recommended.",price,positive
"Excellent product in every way.  This product is light, easy to use, comfortable and excellent sound quality.  All in all worth the money.",sound quality,positive

"These are ugly as sin, but comfortable to wear, and the sound quality is excellent - so much better than the Sony's I replaced with these!",sound quality,positive
I bought these headphones thinking I was moving up slightly from my Koss Sportapros. Wrong! They are a half step down in sound quality.  Specs say they should be at least as good but in reality they have a 'tinnier' sound.,sound quality,negative
I ordered these for an upcoming cruise to use on the plane and the ship both. Have tried them out on my laptop and for their size they sound great. Not as nice as the noise cancelling ones that I keep at my desk at work but then again their not as big and bulky as those either.,sound,positive
I know these headphones are not as cool as Dr. Dre's but they have excellent sound and bass. They are comfortable to wear and store easily. Highly recommended.,wear,positive
These Koss headphones are well priced and nice audio quality for MP3 quality recordings. Not good for noisy environments since they are open style and relatively small but very comfortable for long sessions of use.,audio quality,positive
If you don't have these headphones then you bought the wrong pair.Bose is nice these are nicer. Bose cost 299.00 these are under 50.00 and sound better.No they are not noise canceling. Yes they are more comfortable.Okay so they are the ugly ducklings of headphones but they sound awsome.  These are my third pair. I just wear them to death.They Rock the head!,sound,positive
Fro the price these are hard to beat. I love the retro look and the sound quality will far surpass anything at this price point. Lifetime warranty as well.,look,positive

"I have been using these for about a month now. I have done some traveling, working out, and simple listening at work with the Porta Pros and I love them so far. The bass is great, the sound quality is wonderful for a tiny portable set of headphones, and they are comfortable on my ears.I would definitely buy another pair.",sound quality,positive
"I've owned these for 5 years and they still sound great.  Lifetime warranty, crisp sound, good base for portables, sturdy, comfortable.  Get them.",base,positive
"I find earbuds to be very uncomfortable. These Koss Portapros were perfect for replacing the earbuds that came with my MP3 player. They are comfortable to wear, have great sound for the price and have a little stylish pizazz. They are easy to fold up and put into a suitcase or purse for travel. I'm very happy with my choice.",pizazz,positive
"these have very good sound.  relatively comfortable on head.  I like being able to hear surrounding sounds, so I appreciate that.",sound,positive

My family is hard on headphones. This is the only pair of headphones of any type in my household that has made it six months. The Koss PortaPros are comfortable and have a very transparent sound. Highly recommended.,sound,positive
"These may be a throwback to the seventies, but the sound is great. The only concern you might have is that they don't block out much outside sound and, since the cups are open, they allow those around you to hear what you're listening to if you really have it cranked up",sound,positive
"Yep, it's old style that is back in-style!  These are the best sound quality reproduction, lightest, easy on the ears headphones I have ever purchased.  Great for the laptop, MP3 player, stereo system or your TV.  Koss has not changed a thing in over what 30 years I think and now I know why.  They work great!  Check this out.. my 17 y.o. was shocked at the quality he didn't want to give them back to me. haha!",sound quality reproduction,positive
"Still love the Porta Pros, which play in the much more expensive leagues when it comes to sound. Koss really nailed it with the Porta Pros, which are much more valued in Europe, I found out from a friend. Excellent warm sound, a bit bassy but not enough to ruin the experience, not at all.",sound,positive
"Sound is. Great.Price is great.A little fragile, but take care and it will give you a light weight headset with full sound.",Sound,positive
"Four star sound quality for under $50. Very comfortable, with solid construction. The review on cnet.com is spot on. I could not be more pleased with this purchase.",sound quality,positive
"Title of this review pretty much sums it up. The bass is a bit too heavy, for my liking. However, the overall quality is very good.  My son took a listen and he loved them.  He and his sister have a birthday coming up, so I think I will pick up a couple pair. Good value for the money.",quality,positive
Sound is good overall but these don't wear well.  Miniplug connector shorts out and earpads keep popping out of their cheap plastic plates.,Miniplug connector,negative
"I gave it 5 stars because for the price, these are about the best headphones you can get sans a good sale. I recommend it to anyone who wants a great pair of headphones you don't need an amp with.",price,positive
"I have been looking for good moderately priced headphones for some time. Koss offers a an excellent product.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.  Great bass, highly enjoyable sound.  Sounds a little heavy but still very listenable.  Please replace those ear buds and enjoy great music. Highly recommended.",bass,positive
These headphones sound great and the price can't be beat.  I use them frequently.  I did not give them 5 stars because they can get a bit uncomfortable after extended use (2+ hours) and they do very little to block the sound from being heard by anyone close by.,sound,positive
You know how noisy the NYC subway is? This product is totally amazing block out the noise but still can hear the announcement. Nice deep base too.,base,positive
"Koss PortaPro is light and sounds very good but not spetacular, of course you do not expect it to be at the price. A great value.",value,positive
"Happy with Koss PortaPro. Light, comfortable, adjusts easily, great sound quality, while allowing to hear a phone next room ringing.What Porta name has to do with it, beats me. Not sure what to do with the little bag enclosed, or the fatter adaptor bushing that came with it, but a nice touch.Happy ears.",sound quality,positive
This sound much better than Sennheiser PX 100 (owned for about 2 years). It is comfortable on me but I just don't like style. PX100 look better.,sound,positive
Amazing sound at an amazing price.  They are more bass heavy than the KSC75. Together they compliment each other very well!,price,positive
"A classic headphone that should be in everyone's collection ..These headphones have remained the same for the last 20 over years ...Recently, it has finally been made to allow iPhone users to enjoy these with the mic function.",headphone,positive
"So many good reviews so I will keep it shortI have 2 models of Koss,Koss Porta-Pro (semi-open design, bass is plenty, light and easy on you ears) these are very comfortable and I am wearing them now :) Koss ProDJ100 (Closed design, a bit more detailed and more of a solid bass but not boomy) I find I use these for gaming allot as well as Music and find them Very Clear :)",bass,positive
"Great shape, lightweight, good sound for inexpensive price.I love hearing bass, high notes, low notes, without being tortured by a different song coming on next on my music mix only to blow my ears out - never happens with these headphones.  Quality, easy to wear, they don't give you that feeling that you want to throw them because your ears won't hurt!",shape,positive
Awesome low freq definition. Highs are equally good. For the price ..its absolutely unbeatable. Haven't yet found anyone beat these old babies. I had already tried some good stuff like the Klipsch custom 3. Porta Pro rules,price,positive
"Ok, i searched for some headphones that were Over-Earred and durable...these headphones are look and sound Excellent! I can't believe i used to have a pair of Sony MDR-zx100, i know you can't compare the two, but these headphones are my personal favorite headphones that feel and sound amazing in my ears. 5-stars! Thanks Amazon!",look,positive
Great headphones.  Comfortable but not especially lite weight.  I would purchase again.  I like the single cord.  xxx xxx xxxx,single cord,positive
"Wish I would have bought a different pair, as now I'm back on here searching for replacements.The sound of these is decent, but you'll find the cushions fall apart quickly and the pair will end up in a landfill after little use.Do yourself a favor and buy something more durable.",cushions,negative
"These Koss headphones are such a great buy. Less than $20 and u get a very comfortable fitting set and great sound too. These, of course, do not have audiophile quality,  but for the everyday Joe who wants good sound and fit at a great price these are the ticket. ;)",fitting set,positive
"The first time I bought these was about 6 years ago. They are still working just like new, without any distortion. Comfort of these is amazing. Few days ago I have ordered another pair and some ear cushion replacement. The best headphones for the price!",Comfort,positive

"I trusted the Koss name that these would sound decent, but was surprised they sound as good, and are as comfortable as they are. I have a much more expensive set of a different brand and these sound comparable, and are definitely more comfortable. (These were a Christmas gift for my mom... she's very happy with them, too.)",sound,positive
"Ugly as hell but they work well. I wouldn't wear them outside. I've been falling asleep with them on for maybe 8 days now and they haven't broken. Not uncomfortable to sleep with. Very light weight and feel good on my head and ward. Again, in case I wasn't clear.... they are really freaking ugly!",weight,positive
I have had the Koss UR -20 headphones for over a year.  I used them for studio recording and mixing. I use them with my headphone amp to make them sound better. The sound is balanced in these headphones.I do like the build quality of these headphones. I use these as my back up pair of headphones.  I recently upgraded to the TASCAM TH02.,build quality,positive
"Really nice pair of headphones (replacing an older set of Koss's, destroyed by my cat) - robust bass, etc.  Ear coverage good,  rugged cord.  Looks like a decent pair that should last a long time (cat permitting).",cord,positive
"For this price they are very good. They are boomier than the Koss porta pro but they completely cover the ear.really well for watching movies or TV. Musically, they are fine just not as clean as the Porta-Pros.",price,positive
"I use Bose when travelling for the noise cancellation, but I don't need to leave the Bose around so the cat can play with it at home.This is a great substitue.  The over-the-ear padding is comfy and seals external noise from getting in.  Perhaps not as neatly as a $300 pair of Bose, but eminently reasonable for hanging around home.  A great bargain to boot!  Thanks Koss - even your cheap ones are fabulous.",noise,positive
"These have huge ear cups, making them extraordinarily comfortable. The cord is much longer than most, giving you a lot of room to move around. For the price, nothing beats these. As a side note, I wear hearing aids, and even with those in, these are still roomy and comfortable.",price,positive
I purchased these to use for emtal detecting but ended up useing them for gaming on my laptop in peace also. For the price they are great and I have been abuseing them to see if they can handle stress from heavy use. They have held up great and if they ever do fall I'll replace them with the same unit.,gaming,positive
I use these to monitor playback during recording sessions. They sound fine and are lightweight and comfortable. Three more words.,sound,positive
I like the rounded shape of these and the way they cover my ears are comfortable they fit nicely and are affordable.,fit,positive

"For the money, these are excellent. I'm not very discriminating so can't comment on fidelity; I use these for my electric piano. They cover my ears well, provide clear sound and are comfortable for extended (one hour or so) wear. Also they're cool looking....",sound,positive
These are really good headphones I had the Cl-20 when I was locked up and these are the sameones but they just aren't clear. You can't beat this quality of this headphone for this price. I have bought alot of different pairs that cost more and they can't match koss. I love them and yes I would recommend!!!,quality,positive

"Got these for my wife. I have listend to them too. Great sound. Full range and bass. A lot better than the ear plugs. Also, cancels out a good bit of noise.",sound,positive
"These don't adjust small enough for me to wear.  I've bought lots of headphones over the years without issue - if you are a big person, these might be fine.",wear,negative
These are ok. Sound is ok . I'm not impressed at all but they work. My biggest complaint is they are lose on my head .. So they must be made for a giant head. Can't adjust them smaller.. They cover your whole ear but since they are loose can hear all the background noise so not good for a Dj..,Sound,neutral
"Right, you can spend a lot of money on head-phones, and not hear much more. These are well worth twice the price.",price,positive
I like these headphones in that they do cover my ears and fit my (large) head.  Good sound and comfortable enough :)  They seem well enough made.,sound,positive
"The very best feature about this feature is that the ear cups are huge. I've seen some previous reviews complaining that they were too big, but I think they're terrific. I have big ears, so these are perfect for me.The only CON is that the headphones can easily adjust the sliders. When you pull the headset to fit your head, the sliders that change the head size will shrink.Overall: 9/10",ear cups,positive
I use headphones for TV viewing so as to not bother my wife.  These over the ear headphones fit excellent over the ear.  No pressure on my head.  Block out other sound excellent.,fit,positive
I use these headphones at home for casual use.  They are perfect for that situation.  They are very comfortable and the sound quality is good for this price.,sound quality,positive
good sound quality for such a low price. I like that the cable comes out of only the left side.,sound quality,positive
"These are great headphones for watching the tube and casual listening at home or work. They're comfortable and block out external noise really well. Lifetime warranty to boot! They sound good - smooth, flat  and full - but are not ""audiophile"" quality. You could do a lot worse for a lot more jing! Stick with Koss, they know ""cans!""",listening,positive

"I needed an inexpensive set of headphones.  Several manufacturers offer inexpensive headphones but I learned a long time ago that Koss makes the best headphones.  These headphones are built like a tank and will last a good long time.  I wasn't concerned with getting the best sound money could buy.  If I wanted better sound, I would have purchased a more expensive set of headphones.  For what I needed, these headphones are the best.",sound,positive

for the price you will not find a better pair. sound quality is top a+ nice fit also what more can i say,fit,positive
&#8226; They cover your ears completely and a sit a little tight but comfortable&#8226; The sound quality is not bad at all for music and videos&#8226; Easy to adjust but no way to lock it&#8226;  The wire is long enough to put the computer on a table and watch videos without leaning forward,sound quality,positive
"Gave these as a stocking stuffer and well received. They were worn during workout, and were very comfortable as well as pretty decent sound...especially for the stocking stuffer price!",sound,positive
I use these with my MP3 player to listen mostly to audio books and podcasts.  They stay on and are comfortable with a good length for the cord.  Time will tell if they become my favorite headsets.,cord,positive
"The headphones provide great sound throughout their sound range.  Even though they are not over ear headphones the bass is solid, and always there without downing out midrange or the high notes.  They can be worn for extended periods of time without fatigue, and your ears do not sweat.  I would strongly suggest incurring the additional expense for an in-line volume cotrol to watch movies.  Since your not next to your receiver it makes volume adjustments much easier.",sound range,positive
"Good sound, would certainly buy another set...I just might soon, for back up. Excellent sound. I have some live recordings and sometimes find myself looking around for planes flying...but it's just in the recording! They might look kind of stupid, but they sound great and are very sturdy for work outs. good score!Jan 09 updatestill going strong. Use them for my workouts. Got that retro Starsky vibe.",sound,positive
"These headphones have teriffic sound regardless of their low price. I own a few pairs of quality headphones, including a pair of Etymotic er4p's. The Koss Sporta Pro 'phones sound great and the price is fantastic. The bass is incredible and the highs and mids are great as well. These 'phones are worth the price, and then some.",highs,positive
These things are fantastic for the price and portability. I bought them because I hate ear buds and wanted something with more oomph but without the clumsiness of wrap around headsets so I could walk and listen to music on my cell phone. Very nice bass and treble with a little loss on the mid range. I have always loved Koss and these are no exception. Recommended,price,positive
"Pros: Fits well. Comfortable, not in ear.  Adjustability has advantages and I can wear a hat with them.Cons: Not good Koss quality sound.Sum: Good workout phones if you prefer not to stick anything in your ear. Recommend but only for niche that it fills.",Fits,positive
"These Koss SportaPhones are great. (the name is a bit corny) Comfy on the head in the usual position and in the back of the head setting.They sound very clean, and very clean in the midrange, and have provide some surprising base notes.A great buy the $28.00!",base,positive
"I wasn't expecting much but these sound great!  I'm no audiophile but I am a speaker junkie and these sound good with jazz and rock.  And feel really comfortable on my head.  Not the coolest looking headset in the world but who cares.  I'm ripping the speakers out of this and installing them into a motorcycle helmet.  They play pretty loud with just my Note 3 aux out, btw.",rock,positive

Highly recommended.",cord,positive
"Only on-the-ear headphone I have used.  Very comfortable. Highs and midrange are very nice however I expected more bass (may be an ear fit issue).  I  also expected a more compact fold-up. Otherwise, I am very happy with them.",Highs,positive
"I have been using SportaPros for over 10 years.  I have gone through 4 pairs (I'm pretty rough on them.)  The sound response is excellent for the price and they fit great (and tight) for when you're training/working out/etc.  Also, you don't look like one of these fools with huge DJ headphones on their heads.",fit,positive
"They stick to my head pretty well while working out at the gym. The foam is a bit coarse, so it's scratchy. I don't think I could wear them all afternoon at a football game, but the bass is excellent, great motivator when doing those situps during a 90 min workout. I would buy them again.",bass,positive
"I do like the sound, and the fold-up and tuck-away design is handy. I have trouble getting them positioned comfortably when I'm wearing glasses, though. It can be done, but it's troublesome. I think I'll get used to them. Yep, they're ugly, but we know that from the photo, and I didn't deduct stars for that.",sound,positive
"got the original portapros back in the early 80s and been using the successive variants ever since.  nothing beats these for performance vs. value.  I'm a picky listener (mostly classical) and have gone through way too much money buying stereo equipment of all types since the 1960s but these little headphones from Koss have been great ever since the type was introduced.  get some, you will be pleased.",performance,positive

these are possible some of the best knock around headphones i have had! if there is a contender for the Port-a-Pros it's the Sport -a - Pros!!!!!! these headphones are GREAT and very versatile!!!!,headphones,positive
"I wanted these phones because they are supposed to work as behind the head or on top of the head. Turned out that when used behind the head, they were a little uncomfortable, so I use them with the band on top. Not exactly what I expected, but they are OK and the sound is good.",sound,positive
"Very comfortable with good sounds high through low. They do cut out at anything 40 hz or below. So Hip Hop will be thin in the lower range. Jazz, Roxk, Classical, And more...they are very comgfortable and snug. Great for walking, beach with Tablet or Phone",sounds,positive

"These are by far the best headphones i have ever used. Agreed they look kinda awkward and arent marvelously comfortably if worn for extended periods of time, but the sounds completely makes up for all that. The bass is perfect.. great treble and mids.No complaint what so ever.",mids,positive
"I bought these based on good reviews like above. The treble detail is good and the bass is solid and warm. Not tight and detailed based like from my Sennheiser 580's but those cans cost ~$200. Only issue I have with them is that the earpieces swivel on a small plastic joint that tends to get looser over time. Eventually, they start falling out a lot. Nice sounding phones but won't take huge amounts of abuse.",treble detail,positive
"I purchased the Koss Sportapro headphones to use with my IPod Nano.  I was surprised with the overall sound quality.  The sound responsiveness is very good.  The main reason I did not rate them a 5 is they are not quite as comfortable as I would like.  I use them while I exercise, and I find that I have to adjust them for comfort long before I am done.",sound quality,positive

I have been so pleased with them that whenever I want a pair I simply go to my previous purchase, click on the link, add them to the cart, and as if by magic, they appear at my doorstep in two days. I use a set at work, a set on the boat, a set for the stereo, a set for the music gear, etc, etc. Love these headphones.",headphones,positive
I use these headphones with my Avid mbox mini and since I have set everything up I have stopped using the speakers with my computer as these sound better.  They are comfortable for wearing long periods of time without any complaint.  My wife will steal them to use on her laptop when doing school work for the same quality and comfort reasons.,wearing,positive
"These headphones are great at this price! I already have the previous model MDR-V150 which are without the volume control and I wanted one more pair for recording vocals so that the performers can individually set the volume. My only complaint is that there's a certain fatigue after wearing them for more than 4 hours! Overall, the sound is great and very well balanced!",sound,positive

These are great headphones for the money. I have a home recording studio and use these when I play. They are light and comfortable and have plenty of bottom end. This is one step up from the MDR-150.

I have been beating these around for 9 years now and they are just as great as the day I bought them.  Still intact no sign of wear and tear.  Love the fold up design.  Glad to see they are still making these.,design,positive
"These sound awesome, and I am not a DJ.  I was just looking for some old fashioned, ear thumping headphones.  I love the way that they fold up and I love the strength in the cord.  The only negative thing that I have to say is the ear sweat you will suffer from having these on your head as you rock out.",cord,positive
"If it is music, gaming, movies, or whatever, these headphones are great.  Comfortable to wear with high quality music.

"These headphones are terrific. I use them all the time for listening to music and watching movies. I have had them for a few years now, and they still work just as good as the day i bought them. They have a nice long  cord, so you don't have to sit close to your receiver or dvd player. If you  are looking for a set of headphones, these are one of the best for its  price range.",work,positive
These are good headphones for the price. They deliver brilliant fidelity across the audio spectrum. I was really impressed by both the bass and treble reproduction and response and their ability to envelop my ears diminishing outside sounds. I use these with a Yamaha receiver. They deliver very good sound with this receiver. The receiver can play a factor on how sound and music is reproduced through these headphones. That is something you should consider when choosing any headphones.,bass,positive
"Comfy to wear, sound great, sturdy enough. Wrap around the ears nicely to keep ambient noise at a minimum, keep the good smooth highs and round bass in. About the same as the V6s I had for 20 years, but more comfortable.",wear,positive
"I purchased these three years and four months ago, they still sound as good as day one. All sound is crisp and clear.  They are comfortable for many hours. I got them for sixty -six bucks.

"These are good, blocks off all sound so you stay focused, so when I'm in grind mode in the studio I'm in GRIND MODE. Only thing is, if listening on high volume in a tight place, like the car, EVERYONE will hear what your listening to. EVERYONE.

"I've been in the broadcasting business for over 15 years and these are the best headphones I've ever used.  It took some convincing to invest in them, since I usually bought cheaper headphones.

"From the start had to fiddle with plug to get good sound.At first, I thought it was the computer jack, but as timewent on it got worse and worse.

I've had other badexperiences recently, they just aren't what they used to be.",wiring,negative

I want to get a pair myself!",fit,positive

The sound quality is the best of any home headset I've ever used. I bought another brand at a RadioShack and it sounded HORRIBLE.But the manufacturing quality is bad.

I have used this very model headset for many years and yes after several years they do wear out as do many things but when I had to replace the one I had I found it here at Amazon.com and not only were they new but they were the least expensive I could find anywhere. Some site were asking as much as 4 times what I paid here.. Thanks once again Amazon.com,headset,positive
I've had this model for years. I'm happy to keep buying them when they wear out because the sound quality is good and the mute button on the cord is a lifesaver when office interruptions happen in the middle of a phone call. I've used this model for over 8 years with a Radio Shack headset amplifier and the Nortel and Polycom phone systems. Love it.,sound quality,positive
It is nice that it gives the option to use either over the head or over the ear. The padded speaker cover is comfortable and will not wear out like the foam kind. I used the switch to turn the the mic on and off a lot and has made it much more useful to me.,speaker cover,positive

It also comes with an ear loop. Great incoming and outgoing volume controls.",outgoing volume controls,positive
"For the price, you can't beat this little headset.  The mute switch sets it apart from other headsets, which is a must-have feature for conference calls.It is also comfortable, and in my expererience, fairly durable.

"Why buy more expensive headphones unless you're into some kind of job that requires better.  This head phones sound great and are very well constructed they will endure many, many years of musical pleasure.

It is an excellent product on every aspects in terms of comfortableness, construction quality, sound quality and etc.After retracted, the whole thing is bit of bulky. It is not a portable product for carrying around in your backpack. Also rigid and cheaper looking leather bag is not a match for this earphone. I'd rather to have a soft cloth bag for it.",construction quality,positive
"These headphones are great! They give what some people call a flat sound...just the way an acoustical instrument woud sound in a room without an echo. In other words no excentuated highs, basses or midrange. They are ruggedly constructed for professional use. They are also pretty comfortable with one slight drawback. The plastic padding around each phone fits so snugly around my ears that my ears eventualy get a little too warm.Buy them. You wont be sorry.",sound,positive

"These are, by far, the best headphones I've ever owned.  Sony got it right when they invented the MDR-V6's, and that's why they've stayed pretty much the same (even the packaging) for about 30 years.  I'd recommend them to anyone.",packaging,positive
"and terrific sound. You don't need to spend $200+ on the good doctor's  prescription :). These are a very wise, economical, and sound worthy choice.",sound,positive
"Based on all the recommendations on Amazon and around the Internet, this was the best model at my target price. The product actually exceeded my expectations. The sound is superior and the headset is very comfortable. As expected, Sony has not had to update this model for years because you can't improve upon perfection at this price point.",headset,positive
"I like this headset, sound quality was great!Note:Cord is long.. No I mean really Long...It has an adapter for the large audio jackThey are adjustable for sizeThe ear pads are nice and soft",ear pads,positive
"Good set of cans for mixing and hearing they sound as it was recorded. If you want something for recreational music listening, these might not be for you thought I don't see why these couldn't be used for that. These have a good rep for a reasonable priced headphone for audio mixers etc.",priced,positive
"Bought for my daughter for her sound engineering class.  They are versatile (2 types of connection) for home and studio.  Great sound high and low frequency and buffer ambient sound pretty well.  Highly recommend. Not the best money can buy, but a good deal.",sound,positive
GOOD value for the money. Very nice sound quality and comfortable to wear for long periods.,sound quality,positive
"I bought 3 different sets of headphones and this is the set I ended up keeping.  These are comfy, sound great, and feel like they will stand up to my daily uses.  Did i mention they sound awesome?>",sound,positive
"The quality of sound from these phones is fantastic. Easily set-up, wonderful sound.Thanks.",quality of sound,positive
"If you want better sound get the 50mm versions (MDR6506?).  Anyway, this is what we use in professional studios. Aint nothing expensive to buy.  How do you like that?This is what the record you are listening to was mastered with!",sound,positive
"I'm listening to Linda Ronstadt singing, Someone to Watch Over Me, as I write this. The sound is clear. There is no overbearing bass, just enough, the high notes sparkle like NYE champagne, and, Linda's Voice is wonderful, fantastic. The headphones don't get in the way of the music.",Linda Ronstadt,positive
have tried jvc and others but sony is THE BEST for home recording studio and other uses including watching shows,recording studio,positive
"Bought these head phones for my wife. She uses them when she flies, they fold up nice and they have better sound quality  than the ones i have that are a lot more expensive. Next ones i buy will be the sony's",sound quality,positive
"I've had these headphones for six months and have been very pleased with my investment.  I use them at work and they are very comfortable and the sound is of very high quality, much better than the earbuds I was using before.  The included carrying case is another bonus, as is the folding design which makes these headphones portable enough to take on a plane.",design,positive
best headphones on earth. i actually confused some of the sounds on the records i was listening to for real sounds in my room. xD the bass really comes out and its so rich and distinct. it really had made me fall deeper in love with music.,music,positive
it's like a classic headphone but can beat many modern day headphone in terms of sound reproduction and quality.definitely won't regret owning this,sound reproduction,positive
"Extended frequency response for harmonics,  thus sound is crystal clear. Also bass response is excellent. Very comfortable on the head and ears. This phone does NOT eliminate ambient noise, nor is it designed to do so.",bass response,positive
"It sounds great. And over the last year, It has proven to be quite sturdy. Easy to store in the bag that it comes with. I highly recommend it.",store,positive
"First of all, I was nearly dissuaded from purchasing these because of complaints about tightness. Anyone who says these are tight probably never wore real headphones before. Depending on how pampered your ears are you may need more padding but that's it. Sound quality is superior and the fact these fold up so nicely make them excellent if you travel. As long as Sony makes these I doubt I will buy another brand/model.",Sound quality,positive
Love these have done well and still have great sound and quality just as good as good if not better then the hip hop brands,sound,positive
"An excellent product, the audio quality is commensurate with the cost. Its design is perfect and comfortable. I've used products like this headset PRO2 and for less money obtiee very similar performance.Excellent, I recommend it.",design,positive
"Great buy!! I read previous recommendations and made up my mind to get this great headphones.  They are as described. Sounds crispy and I think it gets better as you use them.  Very good isolation, despite you can hear when somebody talks which is a good thing.  Frequency response is amazing and seem to be well built too. Excelent ratio quality-price.",isolation,positive
"Arrived reasonably quick.  This headphone is from the last generation (age-wise).  It has better quality than many current more expensive name-brand models by different manufacturers.  Good sound quality for the money.  However, I have a big head and feel the headphone clamming on my head overly tight just like several other reviewers have commented.  My son loves it and it doesn't bother him.  He is using it all the time.",Arrived,positive
I use these every day at work. Comfortable. Great sound. Much better build and sound quality than any other pair I've owned. Tried to talk the kid into these instead of the silly Beats but couldn't do it. Sound quality is a distant second to looks apparently.Could only be better by allowing for easy cord removal. I almost never need a 3m coiled cord. I'll probably follow one of the excellent DIY cord replacements online.,sound,positive
I use these headphones several times a week on my computer to listen to music.  Fantastic sound quality.  One of the best audio purchases I've ever made and I have three surround systems in my home.  Very pleased indeed.  Would buy again !!,sound quality,positive
Thank you Sony. This is a very good headphone. Comfortable on the ears and not so heavy to bring around.,headphone,positive
"Can't go wrong with these headphones, the price is right and the sound is very good. I'm no audiophile, and these aren't audiophile priced headphones, but they work great for gaming and music sounds crisp and clear. I would say give these a try if you are looking for reasonably priced headphones that sound good.",music,positive
"Buy them. Light, comfortable and great sound. I will say that I was disappointed at first. Initially they are too (painfully) bright, but after about 30 hours I was really impressed.",sound,positive
"I can't say enough nice things about these headphones.  You will not be disappointed.  I've had a pair for nearly 10 years and they are still killing it.  Buy a pair now, or spend three times as much for essentially the same headphone.",headphones,positive
"I love these headphones. The sound is superb. Bass, Treble, etc... It's all super good. In the airplane they are just about noise canceling. The only beef I have with these is they are a little loose on the head. I'll take it though. I have used them with a Droid Phone, and I don't think they are quite loud enough sometimes. However, that is just the phones issue I bet.",sound,positive
"Bought for my Nephew as I have a pair that was purchased in 1989 and after replacing the pads are still wonderful.He really likes them and I rarely see him without them now! (He's 15)He's using them with his iPhone, iPad, and notebook.Hopefully he'll get 35+ years out of them.",pads,positive
"Purchased this set for my father who has difficulty hearing.  He likes to listen to music on an MP3 player while mowing the lawn.  These work well, he says that they sound great and block out a lot of background noise.  He is very please with them.",sound,positive
Audio is crisp and clear and design is very comfortable. Even more comfortable when paired with the Beyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour Padded Earcushions.,Audio,positive
"For the price, you can't beat these. I'm an audio nut. These headphones are balanced. Very versatile. Great quality and comfortable fit. Can't see a headphone beating these out (for the price). They sound like $300+ headphones.",quality,positive
I bought these as a gift because I had bought these very same headphones for myself years ago.  I love them.,headphones,positive
Beautiful sound.  Very clear highs and solid bass.  I also have Sony noise-cancelling phones.  I love Sony products.  Very dependable quality.,bass,positive
"I produce digitally composed music. These are an absolute for anyone that makes computer music, just go ahead and add these quality, comfortable, crisp sounding headphones to your studio.No need to look around at other brands or cheaper/more expensive ones, these are the headphones you are looking for. Trust me.Check out my old tunes at  . Bunch of new songs droppin' in January. My soundcloud will improve now that I have these headphones.",headphones,positive
"Didn't buy these on amazon, but had to come and pay my respects. I noticed after buying these that a lot of radio programs would use these headphones.",headphones,positive
"I have a collection of headphones, but now by far this is my favorite, very comfortable in long use. Highly recommended. On the go they are lightly and when not in use, they fit in the pocket of my regular jacket. I love them, the sound is crystal clear. And for that price nobody can beat them.",price,positive
"Love them, sound fantastic, easy to ware.  I'm a programmer and I ware them for about 6 hours a day every workday while listing to music.-James",sound,positive
"I've had these headphones on at a reasonable volume, and I cannot hear people directly in front of me talking to me.  The sound quality is excellent.  I want an extra pair because my husband keeps stealing mine.",sound quality,positive
"These headphones are great, when buying these headphones don't expect major hardcore bass because that is not what they are meant for, they are evened out and have a very clear pleasant sound balancing all of the sounds in music, videos, etc.",sound,positive
"I'm very happy with this headphones, however I can't take them to my office. I just enjoy them in my bed and feel in a concert. Great seller, beautiful sony package.",seller,positive
"Fit perfectly on my head - I'm 5'1&#34;, so some headphones are rather loose because the headband is too big.Great noise cancelation without giving me a headache.Great clear sound",Fit,positive
"Possibly the best headphone I have ever bought. The build quality is great, One complain the ear cushion can ware off easily but I third party replacements are available.",build quality,positive
"Not only are these headphones great to listen to,they fit nice and snug. Great sounding phones like these are hard to find at a good price. They are very comfortable and they filter out noise around you. The sound is clear and accurate. I heard sound from my music I never heard before.Thats why I give the Sony MDR-V6, A Best Buy 5 star rating.",fit,positive
"I love these headphones. It gives me a nice clear, crisp sound when listening to music and videos. My boyfriend didn't know what the difference was between good headphones and quality headphones until I let him borrow these. Now he won't give them back to me :( I always go with Samsung and LG for anything visual and Sony for all things audio.",sound,positive
This is simply put the best headphone that I've ever own.  I've never heard anything that sound remotely as good as this headphone.  I'm hearing subtle sounds and beat from my music that I never heard before.  And the price couldn't be better and the cool packaging was a nice topping.  My only regret is not knowing about this class of headphone sooner.,packaging,positive
"The Sony MDR-V6 produces superb sound across the entire spectrum.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I do not find the lows stronger or weaker than the mid-range and highs.  The set is comfortable, and the cups insulates noises well (not to compare to noise-canceling headphones).  All that said, I still feel that the set should cost at $15-$20 less.",cups,positive
"I have a small recording studio and bought these for mixing phones after reading some reviews.  These have a great clear sound, not too bottom heavy like some headphones can be....they can hurt alittle after you wear them for awhile but over all these are really great headphones for everything from mixing to just listening to your favorite tunes.",sound,positive
i wear my sony mdr v-6 headphones at work in an office. usually they get about 4-5 hours of use a day. i must include the fact that i wear eye glasses.  i am totally satisfied with these.  they sound great and the comfort level is 10/10 even with glasses.  my head is a size 7 1/4 around and my ears are about normal size. RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,comfort level,positive
I agree with other reviewers about the sound quality and build quality etc. Excellent product on its own.But this is not for someone who loves bass like me. I ended up buying another extra bass SONY XB700 which is much more bassy.,build quality,positive
I am very happy with these headphones. For under 50 bucks you get sound quality equal to the bargain sets around twice the price.,sound quality,positive
These headphones sound amazingly good and are even better considering I got them for around $70 (Refurbished).They fit very well in my head and I can use them for hours. They also fold and come with a pretty nice carrying bag.Would definitely purchase again!,fit,positive
Its a decent headphone for the priceAmazing soundFor indoor use is perfect but for outdoor like using with iPod not to good the cable is to long and curly,soundFor,positive
I really enjoy having bass back in my music. These MDR-v6's are excellent quality and also work well when used with my iPad.,bass,positive
After close to 20 years I broke down and got my second pair of my MDR's  my first two MDR-600 witch I have are the best headsets you can buy.  The MDR-V6 is the same just a bit smaller and lighter  for the price I am absolutely blown away $40 they should be well over $100 and I paid more than that two decades ago for my old set.  You cant go wrong.,price,positive
"Other reviews are good.  I like these because they are supposedly flat.  I like my games and sound cards to do the adjusting of the sounds.  Good for music and games.  Interesting note, when my Dad did research and picked a pair of these in the 80's, he picked these also.",music,positive
"Piece of crap, the ear pads keep coming off.  I should have just bought the Beats headphones by dr. dre instead.",ear pads,negative
"These are the best headphones in this price range by far. The Bass is great (Listen to a lot of hip-hop and house), The quiet strings (Listen to Classical), and Everything in between, honestly best for that price, Last you 15 or more years, if you take care of them of courseSony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil",strings,positive

"I spent a long time researching headphones. I truely appreciate quality sound, but I'm cheap so I didn't want to spend a lot. Well, for under $100 these headphones couldn't be any better. Absolute clarity with incredible richness and punch. I love these headphones!!!",sound,positive
"Great headphones.....they work well with Ipod, computers, stereos...basically everything.....amazing sound....quite comfortable although sometimes a bit hot....highly recommend these....only downside is that they aren't nearly as Stylish as many other closed headphones out there, and no noise reduction.Mike, Toronto, Ontario",sound,positive
"I've gone through a lot of different headphones, all I've loved for different reason but in the end I decided to stick with these. They don't do anything bad in my opinion. Also I'd recommend you buy the velvet ear pad's for them.",ear pad,positive
"Pros:Great sound Clear, crisp, and bass is perfect not over saturated to the point where you cant hear the music.Cheap for its qualityBuild is solid and not very plasticy like othersNot tight on the head nor does it fall off from being too looseCons:I have encountered none",bass,positive
"Of course you can spend a ton of money on amps, DACs, and headphones. This pair of headphones will deliver 90% of the quality of super high end gear at about 10% of the cost.I also own the ATH M50 and I'd recommend the Sony MDR-V6 (unless you're into more bass heavy things). The Sony's are also more comfortable. They don't feel as sturdy, but they're very well built too.Unconditional recommendation.",built,positive
If you ask my hubby I know he would say this is the best gift I ever gave him.  He drives a truck and when he is getting loaded or unloaded he spends alot of time on the docks.  These headphones take out a done of the back round noises so he can listed to his MP3 player or do work on the laptop!,headphones,positive
"My son really loves these headphones. The really cut out external sounds well and sound very full. For the cost, it is really hard to find this kind of quality in sound.",sound,positive
These sound great.  One star removed because a) it's easy to knock the cushion off the earpiece and very difficult to get it back on and b) the curly cord is a pain - it gets knotted up on itself easily and is generally in the way.  A straight cord would be better.,sound,positive
Can't complain. These have good sound at a very reasonable price. They do lack a bit in bass for my taste but I am a bit of a bass head so this was somewhat expected. I did almost have to max out the volume on my mp3 player with these headphones so perhaps they would benefit from an amplifier. All in all a good buy.,sound,positive
Best headphones i ever bought! Fits on my head perfect no need to press down on it to feel the bass! Works well with trance music! Alots of bass!,Fits,positive
"I love the sound stage of this headphones, I have been using them more and more everyday. Besides the Shure SRH440 are superior (imho) for Jazz / Classical, the sony's are amazing for those mixed playlist.",sound stage,positive
"Bought these headphones 6 years ago. Had to replace the ear pads, but they still sound great! I would buy them again if and when I have a need for a new set of headphones.",sound,positive
These are really good headphones. There is a lot of great reviews on these so I'm not going to bother going into that. I would be very surprised to hear someone did not like the sound of these. I would highly recommend. A+,sound,positive
"If you love the MDR-7506s, you will love the V6s.  I was hesitant to switch but after many promising years with my 7506s, I did not feel alienated with the V6 headphones.  If I had $350 to spend on headphones, I would still get these any day of the week.  Rich bass, excellent vocals, and pristine clear sound overall.  Anyone who works radio, podcasts, or records music will want these.",bass,positive
The sound is decent and the built quality is great. I certainly think these will last me few years. These however do hurt the first time i wear them but i'm sure it will become better in the future.,built quality,positive
I priced many headphones  and this one was the biggest bang for the buck; I can't see how spending more on headphones would make a difference.,bang for,positive
"I can't believe I got by for years without owning these, as a music lover.I got chills right away the first time I cranked up some favorite tunes with these new (old) cans. (Well, new to me.)The frequency response is supposedly 5-30K Hz. At this price point, you'd be hard pressed to find better, I should think.Good seal over the ears without being uncomfortable after a while. GREAT sound.Short and sweet, well worth the cost.",seal,positive
"Comfortable, and sound great.No complaints whatsoever.  They feel well made, sturdy, and durable.Great for turning the music up to 11, while still being a good neighbor.Would certainly purchase again.",sound,positive

These are very high quality headphones for about 1/3 the cost of the high end ones.I'm using them right now at 5 AM while my wife sleeps in the next room.The sound quality is a great surprise. Made well and fit great.The best head phones I've ever owned. I read a lot of reviews before I bought these.I'm very glad that I did.,sound quality,positive
My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.,bass,positive
"I love these. They accompany my Sansa Clip+ perfectly. After burning them in for 40hours and RockBoxing my clip, I could not be happier with my $115.00 total portable audio solution(Sansa Clip+ MDR-V6. These sound great with iPods as well! Bass, mids and highs are great for musical scores, hip hop, electronica, big band jazz, and classical. Great buy!",Bass,positive
These headphones have a very nice sound and are very comfortable.  I use them while playing my electronic piano and they seem to deliver a true and full sound. They collapse into a fairly small size and have a nice storage pouch. The cord is a bit short but otherwise they're great.,sound,positive
"These headphones have great sound reproduction. I also have a medium to large head, and they are comfortable. i have not had any issues with the stock pads making my ears sore. They also cup the ears nicely so they cut out a good amount of outside noise. These are totally worth the $75 or so I paid for them. The sound is comparable to headphones double the price.",pads,positive
I like these a lot and I decided to go with a wired setup for my night time home theater watching. It sucks some times having a wire but sound quality is good and I was able to get two of these for a good bit cheaper than the one set of wireless ones I was looking at.,sound quality,positive

Really love the sound quality and comfort of the headphones.  They fit well and feel comfortable even hours after putting them on.,comfort,positive
"sony's earphone headphone are usually heavily tuned, or heavily colored. but this is not the case for mdr V-6. after 5 years of use, it still remain one of the best ear phones i ever had.however. the ear cushions can easily be worn out (maybe because i have eye glasses?) I can't find a replacement. any ideas?",ear phones,positive
"I knew I was getting something neat just by looking at the brand and all the possitive reviews. These headphones rule, they feel very durable and the sound is just great.",sound,positive
These are time tested phones that I feel shine in the rock genre. A healthy bass and clear highs bring out the bottom without clouding the top.,bass,positive
"Pros -The audio is good once you burn it for 50+ hrs, the build looks solid that will last yearsCons -Heavy and uncomfortable. It presses hard on ears so you can't listen to for long time!I returned to to get more comfortable ones even though I got these ones at very good price 49$ from Amazon",build,positive
"I'm no audiophile, but I have been an amateur musician for the last 30 years. These headphones are an excellent choice for the price. Comfortable fit, brilliant highs, booming lows and middy mids - also very good ambient noise blocking. Even with no input I have to take them off to have a conversation. Overall - just another really great product from Sony. You can get much better cans than these, but not at this price.",fit,positive
"The quality is what you would expect of Sony, consistent and well made. I also am a Bose enthusiast, but I was impressed with all the specs on the Sony Digital headset, so I thought I would give them a try.  I was not let down, they fit good, comfort is good and the sound quality is very good.",comfort,positive
"I have a set of Sennheiser 590 headphones and I must say these do have more detail and clarity. They are very comfortable to wear. I highly recommend them. They are also very efficient (doesn't take a lot of power to drive them). I bought the Beyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour ear cushions to put on them, and did they make a difference. Very comfortable.",wear,positive
Got these for my teen who is a budding musician. He says &#34; These headphones have okay mids and amazing lows. They can hurt your ears after a few hours of use from squeezing but its not that bad. I use them for music production and music listening&#34;.He would recommend them.,lows,positive
"After window shopping at a bunch of stores and testing countless headphones, I decided to settle on this particular set for the sound quality. The sound is amazing and definitely worth the money. I only wish I could've gotten a little bit more bass out of it, but I can complain too much due to the other aspects of this headphone.",sound,positive
"I had the MDR-V6s in the early 1990s...loved them but for some dumb reason replaced them with MDR-V600s. I was never happy with the V600s and now 20 years later just replaced them with the MDR-V6. Right out of the box...instant clarity, deep accurate bass, an articulate musical sound. Not sure what the V6 has that makes it so good.",clarity,positive
"I was looking for headphone with high fidelity, and surprise... I Got it at a reasonable price, Its the best I ever  buy",price,positive
I already own a pair of these Sony MDRV6 Series Headphones & enjoy them very much.  I bought these as a second pair since Sony discontinued them. These replacement  Headphones sound exactly as my other Sony MDRV6 Headphones. Hope these last me as long as my other pair which are now ten years old.  These Headphones offered by Amazon are worth the price I paid!!!,sound,positive

"I bought a set of these to replace an old set of MDR-V600 I had that were falling apart. These are great phones for the price!  Very light, good reproductions, comfortable to wear.  The headband padding is not quite so thickly padded as the V600 but good enough.  I'm sure there are audiophiles who can rip on their response in this or that frequency, but for my money these are the BEST in their price range.",reproductions,positive
"Paid $67 on Amazon.  Bought these for my Dad for Christmas, along with an mp3 player.  Very good sound quality.  Picked up some aftermarket earpads based on previous reviews and are very comfortable.  Definetly recommended.",sound quality,positive

Super high quality sound and for the price they can not be beaten.  My friends all agreed these were the best headphones they have ever listened to.,price,positive
I got the MDR-V6 as a gift and have had it for half a year.The sound quality is best of all headphones I've used.It's a bit uncomfortable because I wear prescription glasses. I have to take it off and relief my head after half hour's listening. But it's just a minor inconvenience.People who don't have eye glasses should have no issue at all.,sound quality,positive
"I have had a pair of these headphones for about 20 years. I have just bought another pair of these.  Before I bought my second pair, I tried Bose and Sennheiser headphones.  Some of them cost more than $300 per pair, but nothing beats these old Sony headphones in sound quality.",sound quality,positive
"This is probably the best money I have ever spent on. I originally bought a pair of V6 at Best Buy ten years ago. YES, ten years later they are still functioning well except the ear pad falling off and I replaced the ear pad. It sounds still amazing compare to a lot of phones I got in recent years - Bose, even compare to B&W.... This is definitely worth the SONY brand. Highly recommended!",money,positive
"excellent sound, of course these lack the base that we have in the new headphone we have now but i'll still pick these over a beat or bose.the only thing i don't like is the long very long wire which make them more for home use headphone.",sound,positive
"These headphones lasted 2 years total.  The included muffs only lasted 1 year before they started slipping off very often and flaking.  I bought a replacement for $20 and I thought I would be good.  All of a sudden the left speaker stopped working, 2 years after the purchase date.  I'm not wasting my time with any more sony trash.  Save yourself some time and go with a better brand.",left speaker,negative
"Nice picture quality and easy to use.  This unit doesn't include the external power supply, so I would buy one or a card reader for downloading the photos to your PC - or if you are buying a photo printer, too, the HP  models (1000, 1100) have a built in card reader.  Downloading drains the  batteries quickly.  I like the color LCD for reviewing your pictures and  the megapixel resolution produces nice, photo quality shots with good  detail.",color LCD,positive
"Mine was manufactured in March 1996, and according to the original owner was used pretty much daily. I have this beauty now, and with an HDTV Converter connected via the available composite inputs, this set still outperforms modern HDTVs on every picture criteria other than raw resolution. My friends cannot believe the superb quality of the Trinitron image after all these years. Think a new flat panel TV will still be going after 13 years of hard use?",Trinitron image,positive
"This is one of the best 9"" TVs I have ever seen. Sony's 9inch TV sets are incredibly sharp. The reason is the 9"" Trinitron picture tube, its Dynamic Picture Processor and Automatic White Balance. The picture is colorfully crisp and sharp. It makes VHS tapes and DVDs look crystal clear and pinpoint precision sharp.",Trinitron picture tube,positive
"I owned the prior model, which was a pretty good set but had some nagging flaws (buttons often broke, pushing the wrong button reset the picture to 'baseline', which was awful). This set has flush buttons that are water resistant, the picture is good every time, and even the automatic (when muted) closed-captioning is useful. The FM tuner is gone, but it wasn't that good anyway.",closed - captioning,positive
"Cassette tapes are on a comeback, so get yourself this awesome tape player and don't forget to buy some hammer pants and grow a mullet.  They don't get any better than this, complete with mic/phone jacks, ac/dc power, built in speaker and mic, and a mechanical counter!!!  Wow!!!!Respect the books on tape!",counter,positive
"I made the mistake of buying a slightly cheaper GE recorder, with horrible sound.The Sony is only a few dollars more and immensely better.

The 4 stars is arbitrary.  This is no top end table such as Rega.  But for the price it is decent and I have found the speed to be steady.  Most of my music playing is CD's.  I pretty much only buy vinyl music not available on CD.  If you are an audiophile who plays a lot of vinyl this is not the table for you.,price,positive
Title says it all. These are very low quality cables and the female end is a joke.

I almost bought it but checked the speed right before I hit the purchase button.The 12 mbit speed means it is USB 1.1.  That is about 5% of the speed of USB 2.0.It will not work in many applications. You can get a good USB 2.0 cable for the same price.,USB,negative

The USB subsystem provides power to many of the accessories that attach to it (card readers, etc.) If you don't use the power supply, attaching more than two devices will overtax the USB system and stop all devices from working.

"Yes, it greatly improves reception when attached to a telescopic antenna using the included clip. It gave me air traffic and SW. Wish it came with BNC adaptor though.

For a reasonably priced antenna this is a great product. Use with a mulitband radio that gets carried outside frequently. Compact size and long antenna make this unit very adaptable.

Is exactly what it is described as. A 23 ft portable antenna.  Easily pulls out of the case and and you have a long wire antenna.  Attach to your radio using the 3.5-millimeter mini plug or clip it on to the radio's external antenna. Winds back in with no problem. Very good deal for the price.,antenna,positive

"I used this with my tecsun pl-606. Indoors it did nothing. Outdoors, I hung it from my 2nd story balcony. It brought in over three times as many stations than using the whip antenna. For stations I could get in without it, the signal was cleaner and stronger. It worked better when plugged in than when clipped on (even though when clipped it still showed an improvement). It is very easy to reel in when done.",signal,positive
This is a great antenna that makes a huge difference in reception.. Just attach it to the in/out plug and watch it work.,antenna,positive
"I works just fine with my little Sony shortwave radio.  I like the fact that it retracts making it easily portable.  It is definitely not an outside antenna with regard to reception, but it is significantly better than the little factory antenna.  I would recommend it to others as a starter antenna for receiving shortwave broadcasts.",works,positive
"I live in an appartment complex which is brick and I don't get cell phone signals,so I didn't get much from this antenna from my appartment.I will try again outdoors and give another review at a latter date.Two stars for now not knowing how this works yet,nice concept if it works outdoors.Very portable.",antenna,negative

Wire is a bit thin but doesn't affect the operation of the devices. The wire antenna that came with my shortwave only had a clip on which was not convenient. This one has 3.5 jack for external antenna and clearly get me better reception across all bands. Probably the best overall antenna in a super portable package. Recommended.,reception,positive
The signals improved significantly = if there are no blockage from buildings etc and if it is high the signals are excellent.,signals,positive
It's a good little unit. But remember it's only a portable and will just improve reception so much. I do recommend it for its quality and portability.,portability,positive

This would also be great for a portable antenna to take with you on the go!",portability,positive
It coils nicely without hanging up.  Comes with a coupler to clip onto other radio extending antennas.  Not a replacement for a home-based antenna.  Good for what it is: a travel antenna.,coils,positive

"More of a commodity purchase I bought not for a specific purchase, but more to grab and use when needed.  Netgear makes great products and I've never had problems with any of their switches.  Be sure to note this is not a 10/100/1000 switch, but it is reflected in the price.",switches,positive

"I have always liked the Netgear switches. Solid, reliable, and well priced. I needed something at the end of a long run to add another component vs. home-running another CAT5e cable back to the main switch. Works just fine. Auto-negotiates appropriately and no issues pegging it at 100Mbps throughput.",switches,positive
"What can I say, this little box is plug and play. I was out of ethernet ports so needed a switch, two years ago and it still works great.",box,positive
"Solid switch.  Works with my llinux-based computer where one of those green switches didn't.  I read that the power connector was short and would disconnect.  I find no truth to that though I'm not yanking on it all the time.  Also, doesn't feel hot at all which is something else that I've read about this switch,",switch,positive
"I have used literally hundreds of little 5/8 port switches.  I prefer the Netgear ProSafe switches for their solid construction and good power supplies.  While they may not necessarily be the cheapest switch out there, they have been solid in every environment I have put them in.  Enclosed in higher temp cabinets to under a desk they always perform perfectly without a problem.",power supplies,positive
"I got sick and tired of the flaky wireless connection for my PS3 and Xbox 360. I don't have a hardwire ethernet connection in the game room so I bought an Actiontec Powerlink ethernet connection twin pack..(runs ethernet over your home's power lines). Anyway...I have a power link module, PS3, and Xbox360 connected to the Netgear FS105 Switch and everything works perfectly.",power link,positive

"I have had this switch for many years, and recently it has been cutting out.  I have a desktop PC, PS3, Xbox 360, and Samsung HDTV connected to it now, and often when I turn my computer off then back on, the switch does not work until I unplug it and plug it back in.I realize the device is positively ancient, but this should not happen.",switch,negative

Good stable cheap switch. It's a great durable little switch that works perfectly for the home office or small office that doesn't need a lot of ports or a managed switch.,switch,positive
We use a number of these cost effective switches in a variety of applications. Great for multiple computers in the same area. Great price point too. NETGEAR is always a good buy. Very simple install-couldn't be easier.,price point,positive

"We recently changed to a fiber optic internet provider and wished to hook both of our computers up to it.  This tiny little box does a great job.  We used Cat5e patch cables to connect the computers to the switch.  The set up was simple and quick, and we've had no problems so far.",set up,positive
I'm not hiding that I like Netgear products for entry level use. This device has a 5th port that you can use in uplink or normal mode. It is very compact with indicator lights for connection and collisions. It is also very reliable.,indicator lights,positive
"Nice small switch, works immediately after plugging. Plugged it to a DLink router to split internet connection and feed all my PCs; works great.",switch,positive
If you need extra ports for you network these work great and are ruggedly built. The metal case should take a beating and aid in cooling.,built,positive
"Works perfectly.I wish it were faster, but for the money, I couldn't ask for more.  I has never failed me.",Works,positive
"Desired a small switch to share a single ethernet connection to multiple items in my entertainment center (TV, BluRay, Sat TV box etc).  This is a nice compact switch that easily mounted on the back of the cabinet and allowed the single internet cat5 cable running in the wall to my router, to be shared on multiple devices.  Plugged in power, line to network and then to devices all was needed.",mounted,positive
So far this appears to be holding up and working good. It is made in china and the first type I bought that was made in china crapped out after a month. So far this one is working.,working,positive
I've had this for almost a year now and it is still going strong.  There's not much to say about it: plug in your cables and go.  Doesn't require a whole lot of set up.  It's also low-profile and feels like solid make.  Very happy with this purchase.,make,positive
This is very easy to use just plug in the things you need and plug in the power and away it goes. No problems over the more than two years it has been used.,use,positive
"Works as advertised, plug and play. I will say it survived the drop test, accidentally dropped it about 3 feet onto concrete floor and works fine. Why get a half duplex hub when you can have the full duplex switch? After rebate this was $[...], can't beat that.",plug,positive
"This economical little box replaced another which didn't work well. I won't name the other brand, but this is clearly superior in quality, performance, and sturdiness. I attached this to a wall in the closet which has become devoted to internet communications within my home.

"10/100 Ethernet switching How can you go wrong?  Until the recent demise of the networking industry, I worked for Bay Networks/Nortel Networks and remember raving about 10/100 switches when they dropped to the unheard of price!  Wow.  An Ethernet switch in my home office.",price,positive

"I'll summarize the performance in one word: delightful.If you need Gigabit speeds, search for a different product. Personally, I'm using these NetGear switches with Asoka PlugLink 9650s and I couldn't be much happier. A couple of these switches and a HomePlug system is sweet! Now, I'll just have to wait for HomePlug AV2 equipment with Gigabit speeds so I can buy newer, faster switches ... ;)",switches,positive
I've probably used 20.They rarely fail (in my experience).I really like the sturdy metal case and the auto up-link detection.,metal case,positive

"If you have much of a network in your home or office like me (14+ devices) you probably need an extra switch here or there.  I have one in my closet, one behind the television. and one behind the wall in the back room.  I also carry one around in my computer bag just in case.  Netgear makes good hardware.  I would buy again in a heartbeat if I needed another.",hardware,positive
I needed to add another computer to our LAN network at home.  I ordered this and it came as notified.  Getting it setup was easy and no problems.

"I read the reviews and quite frankly; I'm baffled. Though some of the reviews gave this light a bad review; I'm not. This is a great light, it picks up the slightest movement and that is EXACTLY what I needed. The span of it was surprisingly wide and on cue when tested. If you need a cheap but good light, this is it.",span,positive
I bought 2 and both stop working within 2 months. Moisture got into the cheap plastic sensor housing and shorted out. I should have spent the extra money and got a better built unit.,sensor housing,negative
"I mounted two of these on my deck and they work just fine although for just a little more money I could have ordered the SL-5411 that has a wider sensing range (150 degrees), is provided with more mounting options, and has lamp holders that are easier to adjust. The color of this fixture is more ivory and the SL-5411-WH-C was more white.",mounting options,positive
Great for the price.  But very plastic.  It works and is up doing what it is suppose to do.  I wouldn't buy another.  I would pay more for an LED one now.,price,positive
The mounting holes of this light are 45 degrees off the vertical or horizontal axis of the holes on the electrical box. It is impossible to mount correctly without some unsightly drilling.,mounting holes,negative
Its a decent motion sensor that can be added to pretty much any light fixture with space to add it.,motion,positive
"Its cheaper than buying a new light, and it works great! have not had an issue. Has good range, and only works at night, it that is what you want.",range,positive
"We'd had a sensor fail on an existing light and I ordered this to replace it.  The older unit was from a different manufacturer, but looked identical and carried the same model number.  Installation was straightforward--I simply removed the existing wire nuts, removed the old unit from the light housing, and reversed the process to install the new one.  It works dependably, as advertised.This was a much cheaper option than buying a new motion flood light fixture.",Installation,positive
Range said to be 70 feet but in reality it appears to be more like 25 feet.  Next time I will go with a new LED model.,Range,negative
I was glad to be able to just buy the sensor rather than replace the entire fixture.  It was an easy replacement (TURN THE BREAKER OFF FIRST).  The unit has sensitivity adjustment and instructions as to angle so you neighbor does not light your yard while getting his newspaper 600 feet away.  It has worked very reliable for several months in some nasty weather.,worked,positive
It was easy to replace the defective sensor. It has been in service for several months and comes on every time I expect it to be on.I have it on for 1-minute and it always goes off on time. The daylight sensor works as designed.,daylight sensor,positive
"I hacked this into a plain inexpensive porch light I got at OSH.Works well.  It does do a false trip when headlight from a car shines at it, which doesn't bother me.  If people are bothered by this, they shouldn't get in their cars.The photo cell is a nice feature, keeping the unit off during daylight hours.",photo cell,positive
"I replaced my old outside motion sensor with this. It fit perfectly where the old one was, works great and looks good.",fit,positive
"I haven't hooked it up yet, so can't really say a lot about it except it was a great price for what I wanted it for; lights & alarm.",price,positive
This is a great model for the price.  Amazon price is much better than most.  It has the minimal functional controls but more controls would mean a higer cost and more prone to failure.  Buy 2 because the things do not last for ever outside.,price,positive
I had ordered this along with two 10 watt led flood lights.  The lights came right away but waited over two weeks for the sensor.  So I purchased a  Heath/Zenith (different model) locally.  I wouldn't work.  This one finally arrived and it works great,works,positive
"Yes, it works, but the effective range is only about 1/3 of the advertised 70 feet, or about 23 feet!  The cost is small enough, but I'd rather pay more and get one that does the job.  I've found that all of these have a limited lifespan, anyway.  Can anyone tell me where I can get a decent motion detector?",range,negative
Though it is longer than I needed it works perfectly. No shorts or wire noise. Both ends seem well affixed to wire.,wire noise,positive

I bought the Dymo label maker a couple years ago and couldn't figure out why it would print only the bottom of each character.

"I bought this when my Network Router went on the blink.  Since I had a DSL Modem with a firewall, I didn't need another router and this product allowed me to connect 5 computers to the switch.  Installation took about 5 minutes and I noticed an increase in speed right away.  I recommend this product to someone that doesn't need a firewall.",speed,positive

Cisco makes networking easy because their products just work right out of the box.  I got exactly that with this switch which allowed me to plug in several networking devices with one ethernet source.  I have this dasiy-chained to the big 16-port hub and everything works like a dream with issues and no set-up time at all.,switch,positive
"This product has served me just fine. I have experienced no problems with this switch, and I am certainly glad that I got this because I have a computer on 10Mb (instead of 100Mb), and I would not want that one computer to slow all the others down. It seems a little overpriced for what it does, but as a product, its performance has been optimal.",switch,positive
"Works great,good coverage. Had a small problem setting it due to changeing my ISP from cable to DSL. Called tech support, and they walked me through the set up and even help with setting up my laptop.It's been two months since installation without any problems whatsoever.",tech support,positive
Running out of ports since I like wired wherever I can for better connectivity. Worked exactly as I needed and gave me 5 additional ports,connectivity,positive

"Overall I'm very pleased with this workgroup switch.  The speeds are just as good as being connected directly to the modem.  The only thing worth noting is that the device I received is colored different.  Instead of being blue and black the one I received was all black.  As I said, this made no material difference, the device has worked properly for over 2 years now.  Very satisfied.",speeds,positive
"The Cisco-Linksys EZXS88W EtherFast 10/100 8-Port Workgroup Switch does exactly what it is advertised to do - 8 ports, plug it in, and it works great.  It doesn't get any better than this.  I could whine - it doesn't stack (without a mount) on my WRT54GL.  I solved this by not stacking it.",works,positive
I needed to add more devices in my office and this switch worked well.  Very easy to setup and use.,use,positive

"For some reason the ethernet port on my MOBO would not show up, so I purchased this to hard wire my router into my DSL modem. This was done trying to get the MagicJack to work, it did not help.

"I really liked this card until I bought a Netgear FS108 10/100 switch. No matter how I configured the LNE100TX card, it would only talk to the switch if I forced it to 10mbps mode. Forcing to 100Mbps wouldn't work, nor would autonegotiation.If I wanted a 10Mbps card, I would have gotten one. This is a poor performer.",autonegotiation,negative
I have 3 LinkSys cards in my home network. The price was right and they have worked without a hitch. Installation was as easy as any network card under Windows 98 SE.

"I dropped this card into my Dell tower, which has partitions for Fedora Core 3 Linux (the one I use most) and Windows ME (only used when I have to.) It worked great. So I put another one into my wife's Quantum, which runs NT 4. Installation took a little more fiddling, but the card worked flawlessly after I'd found the right driver. It's inexpensive and it does everything we need for home networking.",card,positive

"Inconsistent quality, iffy installation in Windows, and diagnostics only in DOS. This is the Linksys LNE100TX. We have plenty of our customer who opt for this card and have ended=up regretting doing so. The price is what initially attracts, but the shabby construction, questionable installation, and high failure rate - not to mention Linksys' horrible customer support.Avoid this one. You're not saving any money buying this card. You're only gaining headaches and dissappointment with the Linksys card.",customer support,negative
I believe this is a better alternative to the USB drive and much better than a floppy disk drive. I have one at home in my desktop and another I use at work to backup important files. I don't have to worry about loosing it since it is big and it is very durable.,floppy disk drive,positive

This handheld is made with great quality!  I myself had a Palm M105 which has very similar stats.  The Palm Vx is so much better made and the rechargible battery is awesome!  I would recomend this to anybody who needs to get organized or just likes to play games in school or work!,rechargible battery,positive
"Great product.  Easy to use; data transfers quickly from computer..  No-brainer synch.  Rechargeable batteries have a very long life, and recharged quickly, making travel a breeze.

I will continue to use my Palm Vx until it dies - permanently.",longevity,positive
"After using a Handspring, but going through batteries too quickly, I decided to upgrade to this timeless PDA. I have no complaints with it other than the serial sync is a lot slower than the USB sync. I love the built-in battery, metal case, and slim size.

"Very reasonable & reliable product. Does what it claims to do. Easy to use, switches very easily. Note that it converts composite video to svideo & vice versa. So you only need to make one video input connection(svideo or composite video).  Highly recommend to anyone looking for simple manual audio/video switch.",use,positive
"I use it for my TiVo, DVD player and PlayStation and it works great. If you don't mind pushing a button, then it is much easier on the wallet then the $80+ automatic models available. The only thing to be aware of is that  it does not come with an extra S-Video/RCA cable to go from the box to the  TV, so if you don't have one, be sure to pick one up at the same time.",wallet,positive

Nothing wrong with this cable:1. It is a brand name.2. The length is 1 meter or 3.28 feet - ideal for most component connections.3. It snaps in and out securely but not too easy to get disconnected (I've read reviews of other cables with that problem).4. Thirteen bucks shipped.,component connections,positive

"I would give this five stars if it weren't for the ugly colors.  It is a great product and offered for a great price.  I think the price is lower because of the ugly colors.

"I was always concerned about the spacing between points of such devices. Same happens here, these are too closely spaced and some of the chargers eat up so much space not letting you place more than 3 or 4 devices at a time.

"Over the years, I've purchase at least five of these Monster power strips.  I like that the cord is longer than most and the color coding system helps keep cords organized.",cord,positive
"Whether you are a fan of Monster or not, the price is right even though it doesn't sound as fancy as the other surge protectors.",price,positive
"Your standard power strip, with surge protection. Does the job, outlets aren't inaccessible and plugs go in just fine. Colors are a bit obnoxious and the labels are completely unnecessary if you need this for other applications, but it works just fine. And it comes with a rounded plug that stays out of the way and doesn't obscure more than one outlet.",outlets,positive
"I ordered two of these in June 2011, and have not had any problems with them whatsoever. Great product AND a great price!",price,positive
"It works just fine and my wife is happy with it.  It replaced a generic model which had three failed outlets.  We've always had great experiences with our Monster power strips and surge protectors, so I expect this one will do just fine.",works,positive

"I do like Monster Power products but you certainly pay a premium to get them.  That's okay - it's slim, has plenty of plugs, and works.  After a lightening strike that blew out some other electrical items, this item was still running strong, so that's good.  I don't know if it mattered (the fuse box took most of the hit) but still, I'm glad my TV etc. didn't blow up.",plugs,positive
There are too many quality power strips out there to waste your money on this one.  The number of failed strips (now 12 one star reviews) is an indication of just how risky it is to buy this item.  The strip powers on but there is no power going to anything that is plugged into it.  Pure garbage.,power strips,negative
I like the color coding of the power strip and it's a better strip than most cheap strips found in regular retail stores. Cords are good quality. I prefer Monster cables to cheaper makes and models.,power strip,positive
"I got a good deal on this.  I didn't buy it because it was monster brand.  I'm not a Monster fanboi or anything.  I just saw it go on sale and got a good deal and I needed one.

It's easy to identify products by the included color labels and logos on the device, and offers superior cable management options. All around a great product.",cable management options,positive
"This is so much more sturdy and safe than the typical power strips! The plug fits fairly flush to the wall socket and the sockets on it hold plugs securely without being too tight.

This product meets my needs; it protects a TV, Sat Box, PS3, and a hard drive enclosure.The protector is good quality and has a strong and long cord.  If you do not care that it is labeled for a VCR and don't run coaxial or telephone cable I highly recommend this product.",cord,positive
Very easy to use and durable even with my heater.  I tested it for two weeks during the day and the power surge was still cool to touch.,power surge,positive

"I was having major issues with lesser surge protectors being able to keep up with the constant A/C usage and allowing me to use the lamp and laptop without blowing the circuit or the protector.  This bad boy is compact (when you factor in all of the plugs you get, has a convenient side plug, which allows it to fit snugly behind my couch, and this sucker does the job!",side plug,positive
"I rated it 5 stars because it is a great protector for the price.  You have ample ways of hooking up all your pieces.  Of course, this one is discontinued but I'm sure they made the newer model even better.  Don't know if it actually works because we haven't been hit by lightening or anything.

Saved money and got the right product to protect my new HD TV and PS3.  Same product but lower than local BIG BOX retailer.,PS3,positive
"It's not the prettiest thing in the world, but it is very functional, and is great for hooking up multiple items with power bricks. I have had this up and running for quite some time, and have no had a single issue with it. The cord from the wall to the strip is very long, so setting up the power strip away from an outlet is a very viable option. For $20, it's hard to go wrong.",cord,positive

This Monster power strip is supposed to suppress line voltage noise which in theory should give you better sound and picture and peace of mind should your power go out and snap back on (spike).  Crutchfield's actually did a measurement with and without this power strip and the results where astounding!,picture,positive
"There's not a whole lot you can say about this item, it does what it says and there aren't any surprises.While I usually like to save my five star ratings for things I really love, I just don't know what they could have done any different with this... so, it gets my coveted five star rating.Price is pretty good too... I'll buy more if they're still around.",Price,positive
So far I haven't had the need for a higher price one.  We don't have a lot of fancy equipment .. I felt no need (and I was correct) to purchase a $500 surge protector that C.City recommended.,price,positive
The color coding is a nice touch on the plugs. Makes for a tidy arrangement for the numerous power cords.,plugs,positive
"Product is splendid value for the money, although I'll admit I bought the name for I have known and trusted Monster products for many years.

It's that GOOD!",HD screen,positive
"This surge protector does what it is supposed to do. It is designed for TV/Home Theater use and has the proper outlets for that purpose. I detect no interference using the cable protection.

This worked for a couple of weeks. Now when I plug it into the wall it makes a loud buzzing sound. Now I have to deal with their warranty department. I'll update this review with that experience.,warranty,negative
"This is a good enough surge protector. GIven how much Monster knows about multi media setups, I wish they had spaced out the sockets a bit more. I seem to have a lot of fat headed plugs (adapters for hand drives, cable modem etc) that really crowd out the sockets. There is a lot of real estate on the unit, so I dont know why Monster did not space the sockets out.",plugs,negative

"I find this to be a very well built power center. Of course, the proof would be in whether it can really protect when that big surge hits. I hope I never have to find out. We do get a bit of static on our HD TV on occasion by running the cables through the protector. But that might be from the cables and not the protector.",power center,positive
"Monster has awesome products and this is no exception. I use them on just about every outlet connected to equiptment like the laptop, phone charger, etc. Awesome price should have purchased more",price,positive

They all work fine, and the ergonomics are very good.",ergonomics,positive
Someone once told me that something is working well if you never notice it is there. That is the case with this monster. It just keeps doing its job without notice.

There are now clearly better cameras but for the novice this is excellent.  Great flash.Buy more memory, it's cheap.",pictures,positive

This is one sweet device! This is the best value for your money in a PDA.  Its far more economical than the Vx or even V for that matter. I personally  like the looks of the IIIxe over that of the V series especially since the  IIIxe is jet black(versus the onlder III models with the gray case). The  case also seems more rugged and sturdy than the Visor series. Buy this!,value,positive
I have owned this PALM for about a month and it is very easy to use and very helpful.

When the batteries (two AAA) are drained, you will lose all your data in the device!!!

I bought this keyboard about a month after I bought my Palm Vx. It's been one of the best investments I've made for my Palm. It's so much easier than the graffiti or the onscreen keyboard. It feels more natural and comfortable and is great for taking notes. A must have for any Palm V or Vx owner who uses it for any kind of writing.,keyboard,positive
"I am still a Palm Vx user and I just got the keyboard. It really makes data entry much more efficient. I can write my e-mails on my Palm now!

I had read the reviews prior to purchasing and I must say they were very accurate. Excellent in all catergories except for the all black and hard to see remote.I knew about that before I bought it. I like it better that the Sony 300 that failed after eight light use years. The Pioneer is faster and sounds better.I am pleased with the equipment and my first buying experience with Amazon.,sounds,positive
"Broke three of my CD's the first day I owned it. I blame myself for buying 1990's technology when I should have invested in MP3 / Ipod technology (which I did).

I love Amazon.com.",CD,negative

"Get rid of your mouse pads and never pull out a pencil eraser again to clean the trackbars inside your mouse.I thought that an optical mouse would still need a few more years development to be viable, but you can't get any better than this.  I must disagree that this isn't the mouse for games.  I have never had smoother performance.I can't wait for the wireless optical.",performance,positive
Browsing through my old orders today and saw this mouse. I got this in 2001 and have used it almost all of this time. Works as well today as when new. I have gone through at least a dozen mice roller balls and track pads on various computers but this one is always with my main computer ( been through more than a few computers also). Highly recommended.,mouse,positive
"I was skeptical on whether an optical mouse would have any benefit over the traditional track ball.  I was very pleasantly surprised!  I am running Windows2000, which instantly and without reboot, recognized the mouse.  It  is the four-wheel-drive of mice.  I have ordered one for all my systems!",Windows2000,positive
"This has to be one of the greatest innovations for the PC.  I love this  mouse and cringe at the though of going back to a weel mouse.  This will be  the standard very soon, so why not upgrade now, I know that your weel mouse  is all dusty and not accurate anyway, toss it out the window and pick up  your optical mouse!",mouse,positive
"This is the real mouse to have. I bought (and reviewed) the bigger Explorer, but found too many faults with it. This mouse is the right size, has the right feel, and responds flawlessly to input on almost any surface. The extra (programmable) buttons work without getting in the way. The red glow is still cool without being as bright as the Explorer's near-lighthouse luminescence. One thing for sure: optical mice are here to stay.",size,positive
"It took about 4 reboots for it to finaly work - which I shouldn't have to do with a USB device.  I've put in USB scanners and such with less work.  Still - I'm happy with it.  Works great.  I went from a trackball marble to  this IntelliMouse - I'm not yet sure which I like better, but I think it  will work better for games and photoshop. :)",Works,positive
"I bought two other optical mouses (mice?) before this one, and I can tell you this is the best.  It has a totally different feel than the other two--immediately I noticed it is a more &quot;solid&quot; product.  The others were a little more inexpensive, perhaps, but this is well worth a couple extra dollars.",feel,positive

Remember, try before you buy.This product is durable, meets specs, and good for the price paid.",specs,positive
We needed a pair of small binoculars for shows and other events.  These appear to be decent.  Good magnification with minimum distortion.While there are models with more magnification you have to keep in mind that with higher magnification comes more problems with distortion when you can't hold the binoculars steady.  This model is a very goo compromise.Comes with a reasonable storage case and appears to be well constructed.,storage case,positive
Bought this binocular due to the high reviews and compactness on this item as well as the binoculars are made in the US. Bushnell is a very well known company specializing in binoculars. This item is perfect for my daughter to use when going outdoors and easily to locate due to the color I purchased for her.  recommended for regular outdoor use and those that like bird watching.,compactness,positive
I bought these binoculars and the 12X version for my GF and I for a recent U2 concert.  They worked great and for the price could not be beat.  Overall the 8X was better for seeing the stage as the 12X was more prone to movement and needed to be really steady. For people who bird watch I would recommend either as they are both very light and small,price,positive

I use it for theater and sports.  It does a good job.  Good optics.  The build is somewhat rusty and cheep.  The neck strip is way too thin.  The focusing ring provides for a reasonable distance range.  Overall - very good value for the money.  I've seen better optics and better build however at a much higher price.  For the casual user or the casual use I strongly recommend it.,optics,positive
"These were the perfect blend as far as power vs stability. Meaning more powerful ones would need to be held really steady to avoid to much shake, and any less powerful just would not bring the subjects close enough.

They serve their intended purpose very well, at at this price if they become damaged or lost, your cost to replace is small.",quality,positive

You look in the two holes and point them at something far away and they make it look closer. How do they do it?I'm reviewing binoculars...At 6:00 in the morning...I need a life.They did just what they advertised. I'm happy.,They,positive

"These binoculars look like a quality product. It's nice and compact. For the size, I was surprised how far I could see through it.

For the price, this is a great product. I highly recommend it.",size,positive

Good product for the money ! We recently had the opportunity to go to a Nascar race and didn't particularly want to take a set of full size binoculars. In an effort to downsize and lighten our load we purchased these compact binoculars. Nice product. Very compact.,money,positive
I'm sure there are higher priced/better binoculars but for this price I think u can't get much better. Awesome Bushnell quality. I take these on any trip to the outdoors. I wouldn't really go for higher magnification for hand held binoculars unless u have a very steady hand. Would buy these again,Bushnell quality,positive
"Well-made pair of binoculars, for a good price! Bought them to see the stage from the very last nose-bleed row at the theater, and they did the job splendidly!! May be a little too high-power if you're sitting any closer, though, as you can only follow one character at a time, even from the last row. But, otherwise, fabulous purchase...",price,positive

I was used to very large binoculars, and upon delivery thought these would be too small and compact to deliver quality results.  I was wrong.  I purchased these for boating and other full-light conditions and have been very impressed with the quality.  If I lost my original pair, I would purchase again immediately.",price,positive
"Not much else to say other than these are very compact, light, and have good clear glass.  I bought mine to help look at rifle targets ~100 yards out that are not so easy for me to see through a 3x rifle scope and they work fine.  Width adjustment is sufficient for those with big noggins.Nice and light to toss in the range bag, and they come with a sufficiently little carry pouch.",glass,positive

"It is compact and easy to carry.  The string you wear around your neck can get hurt b/c it is so thin, should make it more bigger and comfortable to wear around neck.  Bushnell works fine and it just take a little time to get use to when you first use it.  But overall, I am fine with it.",carry,positive

"The optics are pretty clear, for a low dollar, high power compact. They are really small, but adjust easily so anyone can use them. They focus easily. The binocular construction seems strong, but the case is sloppy and weak. Though I've only strapped them on a dozen times, the case already has a wear hold near the belt loop. I'd definitely recommend them, even though I'll probably end up having to buy another case to hold them.",adjust,positive
Good binocular. Even a good item to gift also.Biggest advantage is that you can watch without glasses.,binocular,positive

This binoculars are Faaaar from great but for the $35 they are probably the best thing out there. When you have used a par for binoculars that are a few hundred dollars to is hard to give a good review. This are pretty difficult to use with glasses but they again get the job done. I have these in my B.O.B. just in case.,$,positive

I have bought a few binoculars in the past couple of years. And have been satisfied with only a couple.  These binoculars I am very pleased with. The clarity is very good and the price is terrific.

I'm not a pro but this one meets all my needs. a bit heavy to carry around but the wide angle makes it worth,angle,positive
"This is a great buy, much better than my Chinese binoculars. The optics are way better than expected. The only con so far is the weight, it is heavier than my old one so I have to try to rest it to focus properly.",optics,positive

Do yourself a favor and avoid spending any money on this product.",images,negative
Nice and useful item.  Great for a gift for the bird watcher or outdoorsman or woman.  Makes a very nice gift.,gift,positive

I amy be spoiled by high quality military grade binos but am dissapointed in the dusk and dawn capability of these binos. Granted that is the hardest test but I have no issue hand holding this 50 power glasses. If truly trying to see small movement I do have to resort to propping or leaning support but find the field of view to be quite good for this priced binos.,field of view,positive
The great magnification makes this a fine choice. The price seals the deal. Reviews warned about shaky images--no problem if you have something to lean against.,price,positive

"I purchased this for my daughter who loves watching the different species of birds visiting her feeder. This was replacing a smaller pair of binoculars. Only issue is if you are rather close to the object, say 25-30', there is no way to bring it into focus.Good price and quality combination.",birds,positive
This binoculars are the best I've ever had. I can see very far away objects up close. The insta focus system works great. It comes with it's case and carry on straps. I've used them in stadiums in soccer games when I'm seated far away from the field and to watch whales at sea.,insta focus,positive

"I absolutely love this product.  It made setting up my own home network a snap.  Now all my computers can share the same T1 line, as well as each other's files.  Additionally, it provides the security of a hardware firewall!  I can specify which ports are open to which computers, rendering the computers MUCH more protected from the outside internet.  Plus, the router is small and easily sits on top of my subwoofer.  You can't go wrong buying this.",router,positive

"I've had this Linksys router for over 2 years, and it has been quite solid and reliable.Setup is a breeze - configure through a web browser.  Just enter your PPPoE account info and go.  Built-in DHCP server makes home networking easy.VPN works, though you may need to open some ports for gaming, such as Warcraft III.  The only minus is file transfer doesn't work with ICQ, but I think that applies to all routers/firewalls.",Setup,positive
"This unit works well. It took me quite a while to set it up on a Macintosh, and included a lot of guessing, since the instructions are not at all Mac friendly. Once up and running, however, it works like a charm. Mac instructions would have been helpful. In a nation that's obsessed with diversity, there seems scant attention paid to diversity in computing.",works,positive
"This is an excellent product.  I had no problem with the set up and it is a must have for anyone with a DSL or Cable modem connection.  The 4 port 10/100 switch, Firewall, and internet connection sharing capabilities are perfect for the home user who would like to set up a small network or just have internet sharing among PC's.  This works much better than a software sharing solution and is secure.",internet connection sharing capabilities,positive
"As others have reported, quality is disappointing. Thought it was a good router at a decent price, until it started breaking down, regularly (shows red diagnostic light).Linksys website indicates that company knows about the problem, and will replace (only) if within warranty period.  Technically within their rights, but seems unethical to me -- they sold a defective product and aren't taking the responsibility for it.Recommend you avoid this, and be careful about other Linksys products.",diagnostic,negative

It was immediately recognized by the TiVo, grabbed an IP address via DHCP and we were back up and running.  It was a bit humorous to see a 3.5&#34; floppy disk with Windows 98 drivers included in the box, but we didn't need any of the drivers.",network adapter,positive
What they don't tell you is that the item works with very limited OS systems and there hasn't been a firmware update forever to accommodate newer OS.  Sent this back right away.,firmware update,negative
"I've been using this for 4 months, now and it has worked flawlessly.  Very convienent for switching between two PC's using the same monitor/keyboard/mouse.  Amazon's price is the best I've seen for this type and quality of product.",price,positive
"Extreamly easy to setup and operate. Best of all, it doesn't need (yet another) wall transformer to power it. The little power it needs, comes from your connected PCs. Switching between PCs is a simple matter of pressing a few keys in sequence, or pushing a button on the KVM box. This little item is a most welcome addition to my home office!  :)",setup,positive
"Easy to use and simple to connect.  I use it with 4 PC's and it switches without a hitch.  You'll need to pick up the cable kits - be sure and order them with the unit.  Regular cables obviously wont work.  I velcro'd mine under my desk, then used wire holds to secure the wires.  Great buy. I also purchased the 2 unit model for use at home.",connect,positive
"I have 2 of the Elph models and I must say I think they're the best APS cameras available. They are incredibly compact, very sturdily built and take wonderful pictures. The Elph 2 has a smooth 2:1 zoom and a much-improved flash unit (over the original Elph 1). While I prefer my Elph LT270, whichever Elph you choose will make you happy for years to come.",built,positive
First of all... the price and quality are superb.I have owned mine for about nine months now enduring vacations in Austria and Mexico City. I have had absolutely no problems with my photos (regardless of the countless times I've erased single/all photos as well as formatted the card).You will be pleased with this card.,price,positive
What else can I say other than this item worked in the camera that I bought it for. I look forward to the day when these cards are cheaper. But the ScanDisk product was competively priced with other brands.,priced,positive
"I use these headphones exclusively on my home computer with the Sound Blaster Audigy sound card, and with my iPod. These are the richest and cleanest sounding headphones that I've ever owned. The dymamic range is excellent, good clean bass and good clean highs. Definitely worth the price of admission.",dymamic range,positive
So she uses the film. She loves it. Of course it's easier forher than trying to figure out some new-fangled too-many-bells-and-whistlesdigital camera. So we keep ordering her film from Amazon since we can't get what shewants for a decent price locally.,film,positive
"It's getting hard to find film in stores, and this film gives great definition and color.",color,positive
"Would love to have a screen protector that works.  This cover is very thick and it is very difficult to make the stylus function.  After getting used to it, you can make do.  The dark coloring makes it impossible to view on the indoor setting when under bright lighting.  Outdoors it is much worse and very difficult to read even on the outdoor setting.  Definitely avoid this one.  I want my money back!",screen protector,negative
"I had bought this for my Jornada 548 - yes, I still have the PDA and it works fine although it is very long in the tooth now :-) Maybe someday I will be able to sell it to a museum :-) The screen protector has done a wonderful job over the years and has ensured that the endless Solitare and other games have not scratched the LCD screen. A very fine product indeed!",works,positive
"A most for my Jornada. My screen will last very, very long now. Character recognition is just fine. This thing works... as long as you remove BOTH plastic covers. I highly recomend it.",Character recognition,positive
"I've been through three of these little suckers in six weeks! All broke in exactly the same way: the on/off switch drops out, and eventually the unit won't power up. Despite the fact that Amazon and Rio have been great about shipping replacements, this is an essentially flawed product (as corroborated by Rio's customer support - who today offered to ship me unit #4).Look elsewhere!",customer support,negative
"These cords are great, work well, and are a good value with Prime free shipping.  They are available in many different lengths (6, 12, 20, 40, 80 foot, etc.) and are reasonably priced.  The longer lengths usually are not that much more than the preceding shorter length in price, so think carefully before purchasing.",shipping,positive
"Good price on a small gauge FLEXIBLE outdoor cord.  I use it for my Bug Zapper, it lays nice and flat and disappears into the grass, so it can be walked over and not a trip hazard.  Even has survived a few dog bits from my 2 puppies.  And it didn't pierce all the way through, so it's still good.",price,positive
"Do you need a review? It's like any other extension cable, about 20 feet long, white and extends power.More serious side, it's decently constructed.",constructed,positive
"This cord seems as if it will suffice. It is long enough to reach from the outlet on the outside corner of the house to the backyard shed that I am converting into a workshop (hence the need for electrical power) yet can be easily coiled onto a fence post mounted storage apparatus when not needed.I'll see how it holds up to the Oregon weather, and update this review, after some time has passed.",cord,positive
This cord spent the winter exposed the weather and still is like new.No problems with cracking or the cord ends.,cord,positive
"Works just fine and plenty long for my needs.  What are you waiting for?  If you need it, get it, you probably won't beat the price.",Works,positive
"I have found this to be a reliable cord,  I use it for hand tools etc. and lighting and have no problems with it, the 16/3 wire is good enough for the uses I have for it.",cord,positive
"yes it is true, this cable allows me to plug stuff in from across the room.  I wanted white because I plug in my macbook power adapter.  I can use one of the outlets on the other side of the room while sitting on the couch- I am the coolest kid in the library. This will work for indoor or outdoor. coooooool.",cable,positive
"This chord works great outdoors, rain or shine.  I leave it out 24/7 and it is attached to my bug zapper light.",chord,positive
The price sure was right and it looks heavy duty we will see how it holds up!!,price,positive
I don't know what else to say about an extension cord.  They worked fine.  I used them for LED christmas lights in my outside trees.  The cords blended into the grass a lot better than any standard orange/beige cords would have.,cords,positive
"Great product!  Solid construction.  Held up through the winters, the snow, the storms, etc. etc.  Still looks new, albeit with dirt on it.  Works like a charm.  Trusted product.  Would buy again!",construction,positive
"This cable is great for towing trailers, hanging tire swings and has a bonus use of being able to plug one side into a power outlet and the other side into an electronic device, like an alarm clock.",cable,positive
"I am glad I got it as needed the 80 feet and the price was great also, has the three prong end which is a plus also to me,  Thank you",price,positive
VERY GOOD QUALITY AND GOOD FOR THE OUTDOORS. We have our Christmas lights attached to the extention and was covered with snow. No Problems.,QUALITY,positive
"Well, it seems sturdy enough.  It's flexible and because it's green it doesn't call attention to itself as an orange cord would.  So far, I'm happy.",cord,positive
This is truly a great product and the best price online.  I am truly pleased with this product and will of course buy again!,price,positive
This is a great cable for the fountain at my house as it is white and so is the house so you don't see it across the garage.  Works perfect.,cable,positive
The price couldn't be beat. It does what it supposed to do. No complaints from me. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a extension cord.,price,positive
"I purchased this cord to run from the front porch all the way across the front yard to outdoor Christmas decorations, and it has worked perfectly. The connection at the decorations (female end of power cord) even got wet from sprinklers, and I had zero issues.",cord,positive
This is a very heavy duty outdoor cord. I have used it several times and it seems like it will last for a very long time!!!,cord,positive
"The extension cord is just as described, all good, and now I have to write some more words for the review, so I did",extension cord,positive
"I had purchased a gas power generator, so I was looking for cords to run thru the house in case of emergency.  Trying to avoid the ""Big Box"" experience, I found these cords were actually less expensive and had free shipping.",shipping,positive
I purchased this extension cord for use outdoors during the Christmas holidays. I used this one for an led spot light that I put in the flower bed on the side of my house. Through snow and rain this extension cord just kept on working. Great delivery and a very fair price and Prime shipping.,delivery,positive
I used this to run to my TV that I had mounted on the wall at my apartment as it was white and blended in to the white walls easily. Its high quality and works as expected.,quality,positive
Very durable and heavy duty cable. It is great for camping sites which is why I bought it. Hasn't frayed and I got this >1 year ago and it has been overly used at home.,cable,positive
"Nothing special, serves the purpose and is reasonably priced. For some reason local stores do not carry them in stock",priced,positive
"Was looking for a white outdoor extension cord for a while, until I found this one. Needed it to run down the side of my house and blend in with the ""whitish"" color. Cord is of GREAT quality. Exactly like the other orange black and green cords you'd normally find, only white.",Cord,positive
"Purchased this adapter to plug a 120 volt, 20 amp twist-lock pool filter plug into an outdoor 20 amp, 3-prong GFI outlet.  Works great, nice heavy duty construction. For under $10 you can't go wrong. Highly recommend!",construction,positive
great product for hte price.  I came on time and worked well. Exactly the cord adapter that I needed. Others were 3x the price.,worked,positive
This does exactly what it is designed to do.  It locks tight on one end and plugs in to the wall on the other.,locks,positive
"Bought this cable to connect my new pool pump to the old outlet. Worked like a charm! Quick delivery, good product, just the right size, and much cheaper than buying from Home Depot!",delivery,positive
Works great as an adapter for theater lights. It is just the right tool for the job. I love it.,adapter,positive
I've had it for almost 2 years and now it just isn't working right 90% of the time.  I'm ready to toss the S.O.B. but I am struggling to figure out a reasonable cost alternative for home-studio CD mastering and reproduction.Damn - thought it would last longer....,working,negative
"I recently purchased one of these recorders and found it to be quick easy, and no fuss.  It has great functionality and the external input is a good touch",external input,positive
"I don`t know why so many people are having problems with this unit. I purchased mine in 2000 as a factory refurbished unit, and have burned 10`s of mix cd`s on Sony, Maxell, Fugi, and other brands with no problems whatsoever.  Use ONLY ""music"" or ""audio"" cd`s for recording. You`ll be surprised how many people try using standard CD-R, or CD-RW to save a few pennies, and then condemn the unit when it doesn`t work!",cd,positive
I bought this cause I needed something fast and didn't want to spend a lot of money.  The unit ok ok.  It eats batteries fast and picture quality is mediocre at best.  I should have ponied up the cash for a better camera.,picture quality,negative
"Bought two of these cameras to take photos for  insurance purposes.  There was no flash when I took the photos, so when I called the company they confirmed that was correct. When I took another shot, there was a flash.  Needless to say, nothing came out.  Can anyone recommend a digital?",flash,negative
"I got mine at a closeout for less than $15. They are better than Logitech and the Labtec 45 by far. Loud enough for the kids in the back to hear without straining their ears; with quality, too. I sure hope they haven't stopped making them!",quality,positive
"These speakers are a big improvement over the built-in speakers on my laptop. They are not to large, but provide excellent sound. The AC adapter block is considerably small, a surprise for multimedia speakers. Headphone jack is convenient too. Bass, mid-range, and highs are all good. Don't be fooled by the 2 watt rating - they sound like 10 watts or more! They are definitely worth it for any user who needs a simple two-speaker system.",Headphone jack,positive
"I'm on my 4th digital camera, and this is it, and boy is it amazing.  You can print out 8x10 (using ofot.com or shutterfly) and not be able to tell it wasn't a film camera!  The microdrive gives you more capacity than  you'll ever need.  Great LCD screen and great USB transfers.",LCD screen,positive
"I love the Casio QV3000EX.  I use mine in conjunction with the IBM 1Gig Microdirve.  Without the need to load any additional software or drivers, I can swap the microdrive between the camera and PC with ease.

"Crips highs, clear voices and instruments, not overpowered lows, thats how I resume the sound performance of the very amazing HD 600. The only drawback for me is the pale esthetic of the cans, otherwise I would have given all 5 stars.",voices,positive
"These headphones are on the expensive side if you are new to hifi audio, but after using them for quite some time now, i can say that they are worth every $ a paid. The detail of sound and clarity you get is unmatched, Sennheiser is a great brand and as with everything if you take care of them they will be with you for quite some time. Really happy with this purchase",detail of sound,positive
"I always used Sony headphones since the sound quality is quite nice and it is priced reasonably. I ended up buying this headphone through lightning deal.  After listening to various type of music (anywhere from classical to trance), my overall rating for sound quality is 5 stars yet due to its low volume I give 4 for total.",priced,positive
"These are the best headphones you can buy. They are better than the HD 650. As a professional musician, I am always amazed as I travel around the world to recording studios and radio broadcasts that these headphones are everywhere. Beautiful, balanced sound & exceptional clarity.",sound,positive
Great headphones.  Nicely balanced (sonically).,headphones,positive
"I personally like these better than the HD650's. Sound is a little lighter and more musical to my ears. These are very close to the Senn HD800's I own, at about 40% of the cost. If you want to spend less than $1k, I would go with these.",Sound,positive
I have had these phones several years now and they are excellent.  I much prefer these for accuracy when compared to the veiled and unnaturally creamy sound of the HD650s which I ended up returning.  The phones are also more comfortable to wear for long periods of time.,wear,positive

"...They come in a beautiful black presentation box.  It's almost too nice to through away!The headphones are comfortable, completely surround the ear, and have aweseome sound.  I'm ordering a mid range amplifier to give it more pep as my walkman doesn't have enough power to really drive these.  They are by far the best headphones I've ever owned.  You can't go wrong with the price - go for it.",box,positive
"I decided they were a bit too warm for my tastes. They are a classic however, and sound great for the money in particular.",sound,positive
"I received my Wharfedale Anniversary 7 speakers today and am highly impressed.  I listen to mostly classical music - lots of solo piano and guitar - and the sound is spactacular compared to the Bose speakers I was using.  I do not use the ""loudness"" setting on my receiver anymore.  Sound is great at all volume levels.  Clarity of sound is remarkable and the bass is more than adequate.",bass,positive
"Fine speakers for use as primary loudspeakers in a smaller room. Wharfedale instructions are true - if you place them about two feet from the wall (back surface) the bass is incredible. So, in a sense, while they'll fit on a &quot;bookshelf&quot;, they don't perform their best on a shelf. I adjusted placement and am very pleased.",bass,positive

"These binoculars have a nice bright clear image, even in low light conditions. They are easy to focus.

"If you need extended recording time on a VC, this is the way to go. You can get 3 hours at SP speed and 9 hours at EP speed. This VC works great and I have even been able to use it on a older VCR that has a tendency eat tapes is they don't track well. Good tape!",recording time,positive
"These tapes are exactly what we need to record our work day.  It would ne nice if you had 10 hour tapes available, but these work just fine.  Its important to us to have the capability to review any incidents that occur during the workday, and we find that vhs tapes are actually a lot less complicated than computer use.  thanks again",tapes,positive
"Total install time was about 5 minutes.  Performed exactly as I expected and has never let me down - been running 7x24 since last November.  Not real fancy, but then for less than $100 what do you expect?  Simply put, it does the job and it does it well.",install time,positive

Both installed in seconds from provided CD and are up and running on my D-link DI-604 router sharing files, printers, and broadband connection. Great!",cards,positive
D-Link makes low-end NIC's. My problem with them is why they're made so  awfully. Quality is so inconsistent. Their help desk is indifferent to the  card's many installation problems. D-Link's diagnostics work only in  DOS(?).Skip this one...,help desk,negative
"As I said in a review of a very similar product, it should not be hard for companies to get basic stuff like this to work well. I installed it, added the driver manually and was back on the network in no time. A good deal for the price and much cheaper than several of its competitors.",price,positive
Installed in a Win XP machine.  Plug-and-Play auto-magically loaded the driver.  Works great!  Got fed up with my Belkin Wireless Ethernet.  Got this to replace it and drilled a hole in the wall and ran a wire.  Has been trouble free ever since!,driver,positive
This card has worked perfect with no problems since I got it around a year ago.  I was going to get some no-name card but I've read about problems with cards like that.  I ended getting a D-Link router (the 604) since this card worked so well and that has been great too.,card,positive
"Don't Be Fooled By The Cheap Price!  This card is a breeze to install.  First install the software, then install the card, turn your computer back on, and your ready for the internet or to connect to a network!  I have installed at least five of these cards into computers over the past year, and have not gotten one call that they are not working!  This is a great price point, and great product.",price point,positive
"This card is worth the money. However, make sure you install the drivers for the NIC card first as it will lock up your PC on bootup without doing this first. It clearly says this in the installation documentation though, but...who reads that.I had no issues with the RJ45 not snapping into place as another review stated. It has been working fine for weeks now on my parents computer.",RJ45,positive
Bought this because I was having trouble with my internet connection and suspected it was ethernet adapter. The price for this was so low that even though it turned out that my problem was not the old adapter I removed I left the new one installed and it is performing well.,performing,positive
"Definately has the best color screen.Performance is fast and I like the new interface and programs, especially MS reader.  You can read ebooks and listen to audiobooks from audio.com, both from within MS Reader.My only  complaint is that the device seems to slow down after opening more than 4  or 5 programs.  Also, I have needed to &quot;reboot&quot; the machine more  than with my E-11, but it has not been troublesome for me.Overall, great  product and great performance.",MS reader,positive
"Only had it a day, but it appears to be pretty awesome... and it should  for the price.  (You can get a whole PC for the price.)The USB  connection is by far superior to the old serial connects for synch speed.  Transferred 500 contacts in 3 secs.Once the expansion sleeves hit the  market (October)... I think this one is a winner!",price,positive
The reception is good and it cost $10. The design is simple and it works. I couldn't ask for anything else.EDIT: I noticed they recently bumped the price up to $20. I would recommend you buy the Sony instead since it is still marked at $10. I have used it as well and it is the same quality as this radio with a slightly different layout for the tuning. Buy that instead and save 10 bucks.,design,positive

"This little transistor radio gets great reception -- I can even get two different FM NPR stations inside my house.

I did notice if I'm walking around in the house with it, the reception goes in and out; I suppose that's typical.",reception,positive
"This is what it is, and it is good for that.  I got it for my 10-year-old for camping.  A very basic, small radio.  Works great for her and for a take-along camping radio she can use as she wishes.",Works,positive
"If you are looking for a small, portable basic AM/FM radio, you can't beat this. It has regular dial tuning, a fold out antenna, strap and most importantly clear reception on AM and FM channels.

Perfect for radio listening. I didn't want to have to wear earphones just to listen to a portable radio and this little gem fills the bill.,listening,positive

Great little radio with excellent FM reception.  Am could be a little better but of course this is a very small radio.,FM reception,positive
Got this for my go-bag in the hopes that I never have to use it. Tossed in a few batteries to test it out and it worked like a champ.Very small and very lightweight but still loud and got good reception. Good deal.,reception,positive
Barely picks up any station.  Stations that I can get with a much smaller radio come in with a lot of static.  Have tried it numerous locations with the same result.  I can get 1 or 2 stations usually that are bareble to listen without too much static.I don't recommend this product.  Find something more reliable or spend a little more money on something that will work.,static,negative

Tunes in AM and FM stations as good as other units like this I own (I also own a few &#34;Sony ICF-S10MK2 Pocket AM/FM Radio, Silver&#34; and bought this to have some variety. This is almost the same exact size, and has similar performance. I am happy with it.",performance,positive
"I like the size, sound, performance, but...it tips over too easy. If you're going to keep it laying flat or in a pocket or something fine, but its end face is not stable enough to suit me. Basically the same thing as the Sony of similar design but the Sony is a bit larger and thus more stable sitting on a hard surface on its end.",sound,positive
This is a great little radio. Reception and sound is fantastic. Great for carrying around.,sound,positive
"I bought this radio to listen to the soccer game transmission when i go to the stadium.This is a classic style hand radio, it is powered by 2 AA batteries (i use 2 rechargeable eneloops which are great btw).Sound is fine, it supports AM and FM bands.Price is great for a good working product, if you need a hand radio i recommend this little one.",Price,positive
"I live in a fringe reception area, and this radio does a pretty good job of pulling in stations where other small radios have failed. If you hook a flexible dipole antenna to it, it works even better. Sound is decent although not much bass, due to size.",Sound,positive
"We purchased this radio to be used during power outages.  I store it in an end table so that it is convenient if needed.  It is light weight, but great for occasional use.  It works well and I feel comfortable knowing that I am not incommuncado with the rest of the world.  I would not recommend it for constant use, but it is a great backup that is both economical and functional.",works,positive
"cute and sensitive,, sounds much bigger, nicely made",sounds,positive
"I just wanted something simple,that I can use while in the casino. I don't want to have to remember songs I like or figure out how to get them, plus the fact that I dont want to pay for them. So the FM radio was my way of keeping it real. Fits in the pocket on the side of my purse and ear plugs work great!! Price was awsome!! Good deal",Price,positive
"This is an excellent radio to take out to the ballpark.  It is an good size to hold grasp in the palm of my hand.  The sound quality is good for its size.  And, the radio is simple to use: one dial for to click on and adjust volume, and another dial to tune in your favorite station.  Seems to work for many hours on one pair of AA batteries.  I highly recommend!",sound quality,positive
"Soon after purchase the on/off/volume switch went bad.  Evidently some loose connection inside.  If I press downward on the dial I can usually get the radio to come on, but obviously this is a real p.i.t.a. I looked inside to see if I could fix it, but couldn't see where the problem was. Aghh!",volume switch,negative
"I like to listen to Dave Ramsey and Ric Edelman on Sunday and this little pocket radio picks up both AM and FM great.  Clear and strong signal, well made and great bargain for the price.

I like:- Size- Construction- SensitivityI do not like:- Dial- Knob for volume and tuningWith a month of using the power key is failing to turn on.,Construction,positive
This is a perfect radio. It's easy to use for everyone as it doesn't have complex parts or settings. It's portable and is loud enough for a small group of people. In general I am very satisfied.,use,positive
"For sound and tone, this is great for the price. Really easy to use, not hard to get the cassettes either. Reminds me of a time (pre-Internet) when life was a bit less-hurried and more placid.",price,positive
"Audio quality is fairly good - about the best you could expect for a relatively low priced recorder.  The case seems to be made of cheap plastic and the raised lettering on the front of the machine have sharp edges which reinforces my view that this is not a high quality recorder. Ignoring the quality of the casing, the machine is still rated a good buy based on its solid performance.",performance,positive
"I purchased this brand of cassette tape recorder because I've bought Panasonic cassette recorders in the past and have been very pleased with them.  If used properly, this recorder is quite durable, although it's not as portable as pocket recorders.  The sound quality is good.  I only use it for lectures and not for music.  I'm happy that it's still available.",sound quality,positive
"Very good performance characteristics in both record and playback modes; Mechanically reliable, and definitely durable as well. Although somewhat on the large side, that is an advantage of sorts, i.e., absorbs 'punishment' and won't be easily misplaced or lost. Note: pre-recorded tape playback is excellent!",performance characteristics,positive
A great cassette player/recorder that works like a charm. The construction feels solid to me and the speaker sounds clear as a bell. I'm hooking this up to my computer and transferring some old tapes I have to CD. And this player is so good I'll even transfer some audio CD's to cassette!,construction,positive
"Good recorder. To try to comply with Amazon's number of words requirement for this review, I'll say I needed this equipment in order to play a valuable cassette tape I had been saving for years.  The player worked perfectly well and I was able to use the speakers I usually use with my computer to play the tape loudly and clearly.",player,positive
"I use this to record my guitar-playing, and it serves me well.  Sound is good, as is the volume level.  Priced well and shipped quickly.",volume level,positive
"Don't have many cassettes anymore, but some of my older books on tape work great on this little player.  Happy with the purchase.",player,positive
My comments reflect judgements made on the copy I recived. A working model was not judged. The item recived had a loud audio whisle when in the playback mode.  Efforts to contact the supplier proved to be fruitless so the item was returned.,audio whisle,negative
"Good unit, but I don't really like the sound. I'm using it only for voice and durability of the player is important for me. It appears to be a well made unit",durability,positive
I purchased this to replace a broken recorder that was cheaper and a different model and maker that only lasted 4 months. Records very clear even from a distance. Spend a little extra money and get a much better recorder.,recorder,positive
"We have an audio book collection for Halloween that is our absolute favorite. Problem is, it's on tape, and hasn't been released to CD or on itunes. I had to buy this to continue our tradition of listening to it in October. It works well, and reminds me of the player I had as a kid.",It works,positive
"I have been looking for one of these recorders for soooo long.It's difficult to find an older model desktop recorder these days at a reasonable price. I tried it out the moment it arrived and the sound was great. Being a Christmas gift I wanted to make sure everything was all right,I needn't have worried.Thanks again!",sound,positive
"I should have known by the price. It does work, but the loudest sound (via headphone) is barely adequate. Overall, I wouldn't recommend.",sound,negative
"I bought this so that my grandson could play the cassette story tapes that my own kids had.  It is well made, easy to use, and the sound quality is fine.  The price was  a little higher than I paid so many years ago, but reasonable.  A nice tape player/recorder.",sound quality,positive
"The recorder worked ok but seemed to be made very cheaply, with a great deal of plastic. After having it for a year in which I used it, but not a lot, it now makes a clicking sound when it plays. I'm sure it won't last much longer. I would rather pay more and have an item work. I can not recommend this because of how quickly it has started to deteriorate.",plastic,negative

"If you are lucky enough to have a TRG Pro like me, or the new HandEra 330, this modem works fine in the flash slots of those devices as well (Palm OS). On the TRGPro, you may run into some battery problems, it seems to drain them rather quickly, so be sure to have spares on hand, and don't stay online too long. The increased battery life on the HandEra deals nicely with this problem.",battery life,positive

"Durability: I haven't really put them up to the durability test yet as i've only had them for 2 weeks.Sound: Above average for a cheap headphone. I can only compare them to my Fata1ity USB PC Headset and my Sony MDR-V6 cans which both produce much better sound but cost way more money.Comfort: Comfortable, I might just be forever sold on over-the-ear vs in-ear headphones because of these. They are light and I forget that i'm wearing them.",Sound,positive
"These are a good value for the money.  They don't have super-high sound quality - but it's very acceptable.  For audiobooks, they can't be beat.",value,positive
"The sound on these is astonishing for the ridiculously low price. Like all headphones, they are not perfect -- for instance, they sit on my ears in a little bit of an unnatural way, and so I find myself readjusting them every now and again in the vain hope of getting a better placement -- but if you're looking for a great sounding, knock-around pair of headphones for portable use, I highly recommend these.",sound,positive
"It was cheap, or rather I should say inexpensive. Lightweight, comfortable and the sound is very good...  I despise the ear-bud type headphones and these sound better to my ears. Can't beat it for under$5.",sound,positive
We ordered a bunch of these to go with remote receivers for our plant.  These are a great value.  Sound very good for talking voice and for light use.  Cheap enough to not really worry about losing on a trip also.,use,positive
My daughter and I must have small ear canals as we have trouble using earbuds. My daughter uses these with various techie gadgets and is very happy. The price was right. We were not expecting Bose.,price,positive
"At an affordable price, its good to hear the base sound and clarity.  Adjustable and indeed lightweight. I would recommend this product.",base sound,positive
"I like to wear these types of headphones when I run.  You can still hear traffic coming with them on.  The music sounds fabulous, good bass response and clear highs.  The headphones aren't too tight or too loose. They dry quickly when sweaty. The cord is long and thicker than most cheap headphone cords.",bass response,positive
Inexpensive (I am not an audiophile and don't need anything fancy). Comfortable (my main requirement). Sound through the ear pieces is suitable for my uses.,Sound,positive
"I remember these from the 90's - still good for casual listening, light enough for activewear, and well built so it should hold up to daily use. Decent sound quality, rolled off bass and high end, but also good for checking your mix against a 'normal' set of headphones.  Will buy again.",listening,positive
Of course I was thinking these were throw away headphone for the price of $4. I was actually quite surprised how good they sound. Good bass and good quality.I dont understand the bad reviews. My only regret is I didnt buy several pairs. They are also very lightweight and fit snugly. Dont listen to the whiners. buy em.,quality,positive

If you have Amazon Prime, the shipping is free and it is delivered to you in two days.It is usable even if your iPod Touch (2G and 3G) has a protective case on it.I like the 90-degree headphone plug that makes it less likely to break.The headband is adjustable, and its bass performance is quite good, considering its price.",delivered,positive
"These headphones are comfortable, lightweight, durable, and sounds really nice. I'm bought this 7 months ago and they've lasted me without any problems on daily use. I'm buying these again when/if they break. I've seen similar Coby branded ones but they feel so cheap compared to these. Very well worth every penny.",sounds,positive
"they truly are light weight and adjustable, and the volume is clear and I can use it without others hearing what I am listening too",volume,positive
"Maybe my set was defective, but it's not worth returning. There was static and poor sound.  The fit on my head was too tight.  I tossed these in the trash.",fit,negative
"This is my second pair. The first lasted couple years, and I use them everyday for listening on computer. The sound is clear and legible. has bass, treble and all that. Can't go wrong with these.I used to buy expensive brands that cost 20x more and they aren't worth it because they all break eventually.",sound,positive

"The sound is great as is the volume. I've worked with headphones for years as I used to own a recording studio and I can tell you from experience, when you're not actually listening to anything, you should take them off or put them around your neck as any headphones  will start to get uncomfortable after long use.UPDATE: I JUST ORDERED TWO MORE...",sound,positive

"I like these little headphones! They're lightweight and the sound they put out is quite substantial.  Not super-high end audio-snob substantial, but good enough to watch an action movie or edit some footage without costing an arm and a leg. I like the feeling of not having to baby them. So far they've held up, but if I do break them, I'm not too worried. $6.44 and I'm back in business 2 days later.  5/5 would recommend.",sound,positive
I bought this as a gift and the recipient using it on a Kindle said it worked great.  The price was very right.,Kindle,positive

One of the best headphones out there for such a low price. The company was good and the product was great!!!,price,positive
I bought a Roku 3 because I could use headphones with it if I wanted to stay up late to watch a movie.  These are more than adequate for the price and work perfectly.  I am happy with my purchase.,price,positive
"much better bass compared to smaller drive earphone.  I wish that the head band has less pressure on ear.  Not sure if this will reduce the quality of sound.  The wire length is longer than my other headphones, I like it.",bass,positive
"Paid $4 for these headphones, didn't expect much. But they are attractive, decent sounding, and packaged nicely. As such, they will make nice stocking stuffers. Give everyone around you a set and enjoy some peace and quiet. I've used mine for a couple months now and they still work.",packaged,positive
"I purchased both the Panasonic RP-HT21s (under $5) and the SonySony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil(> $67) and the Panasonic headphones are far superior. They are lighter, more comfortable, and have better sound balance. You will not find a better headphone for near this price. Highly recommended.",sound balance,positive
"Light, easy on ears, clear sound, good bass.Feel so comfortable, you will forget that you are wearing it completely.Will buy more.",sound,positive
"Not very often that i will rate a product five stars, but for $5 and a quality sound, these headphones shouldn't be passed over.  My daughter took over mine so i will be ordering two more.",quality sound,positive
I use them for exercise and walking so I bought them knowing I would be sweating and did not want to use an expensive pare and am surprise at the good sound for the price,price,positive
These were purchased as a replacement for a set that deteriorated and to offer a variation for earbuds for some newly acquired audio equipment--an iPod.They are comfortable and offer relatively good sound quality for an economy item. Husband feels he doesn't get quite the same range of treble and bass as he does with ear buds but that may be the mode of sound transmission.We would recommend them as a good purchase.,sound quality,positive
"I've been looking for cheap headphones for the kids.  They break expensive and cheap things equally so I didn't want to spend even $30 on a set of headphones.  These aren't just cheap, they work fairly well too.  Certainly much better than $5 headphones should work.  Great shipping fast delivery as always.",delivery,positive
The Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS Port are very lightweight. They sound ok and make a good lightweight bedtime headphone.  They are so lightweight they slip off my head if I try to wear them during normal daytime activity.  The XBS Port is very useful as an extra XBS Port.  My XBS  really needed an extra Port. Now I can XBS Wherever I want.,XBS Port,positive

"These should be evaluated against other &#34;disposable&#34; headphones, not against serious audiophile headphones.

"I wear hearing aids so unless I remove them, I cannot use ear buds. That works okay sometimes. But if I am about during the day and want to listen to my iTunes on my iPhone, I use the Panasonic headphones.

"Reading impressively positive reviews here, I purchased two of them.  Unfortunately I was disappointed by sound reproduction of theses headphones. The sound is very weak compared to quite a few other equally priced headphones. If I press them on my ears, then I get a mediocre sound. It lacks depth of sound and matches its price perfectly. I got what I paid for.",sound reproduction,negative
I have not used it for a long time but so far so good. The sound quality is acceptable for such price.,sound quality,positive
I figured with such a cheap price tag that these headphones would be complete junk and would distort with heavy bass.  However I was surprised at the clean and deep bass response and crisp highs.  I am going to order another pair just in case I step on these and break them like I have done with my last pair of headphones :P,highs,positive
I just wanted a pair of headphones I could use on my laptop and Kindle and on airplanes. Considering that I  paid less than $5 for these headphones they are good value for money. The frequency range seems adequate for listening to classical music and the bass was better than I expected.,value,positive
"This headset is lightweight, but comfortable to wear. The cord was surprisingly long.. which is a plus for me. Overall I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others.",wear,positive
"The sound is just fair - Cheap Sony headphones sound much better.  And despite purchasing these through Amazon Prime, the seller was going to let me return them after I paid shipping and reshelfing fees, which together added up to more than the headphones.  I had purchased two sets and this return applied to only the unopened set.  Now I have two worthless headphones.",shipping,negative

Bought these headphones by mistake.. was originally going to buy something with volume control but for some reasons ordered these Panasonics. Anyways i have put them in good use.. i used my shure e2c earbuds on my laptop but now i'm using these $6 comfy headphones because my ears don't hurt anymore. i didn't release it before.. i guess my ears got used to earbuds but after using these headphones i feel much comfier.,ears,positive
"These headphones are absolutely the best I've found for listening to the spoken word, specifically audio books played on iPods.  The bass range is just right, the fit is comfortable and the cord appears to be the optimum length.  At this price, I bought several to store away for future use.",bass range,positive

I love the sound of this headphone. The bass is rich and the sound is very clear with no distortions. It is also comfortable for the ears for long use. Definitely would recommend this one.,bass,positive
"I got these for my Kindle Fire and they do a nice job. My first generation Kindle Fire has somewhat inadequate speakers, so for any real listening either an external speaker or headphones are pretty much required. These do a nice job.",Kindle,positive
I bought these to fit a portable CD player. The ear phones worked just fine. It was the CD player that took the lick. I mean for the price I was just glad they worked.,ear phones,positive
"These lightweight and convenient headphones were nearly as good as my $80 Klipsch S4 earbuds and over $100 Bose over the ear headphones, for $5!!!!! Heck, they're almost paying YOU to buy them! Tight bass, great mids and highs. These were highly rated online, which is why I bought them, and for the price, I don't think there's a better headphone on the market.",highs,positive
"These are the ""generic"" headphones my work gives out. It's light and sounds great. I have noise-cancelling headphones but you begin to feel them on your hair and pressing against your ears after an hour or so, I've since switched back to these and they feel awesome for my purposes (smooth jazz, no bass). I was going to purchase some Audio Technica's for 100 but I'll stick with these free ones. And for the price, that's a no-brainer.",sounds,positive
"These are great headphones for the price. Recommend that you pick a set up. My daughter is using them to practice her piano. I tried them out and did not know if the sound was from them or in the room. They sounded that good. I had to take them off to realize that the room did not have the sound, it was just the headphones.",price,positive
"Love these headphones.  I have several of them.  Works with my computer, my cd players, even works with my cell phone except it does not have an answer button.  The sound is very good considering the price you pay, and they are lightweight and comfortable.  Even gave one to my husband to use with his portable ham radio.",sound,positive
"These are the best portable headphones in this price range.  Good bass and smooth, natural sound. In fact they would probably still be the best bang for the buck at three times the price.  If you can afford more, consider the Sennheiser PX100 for about 40-50 dollars. But if you're on a budget or don't want to worry about losing or breaking a more expensive pair of headphones, these are definitely the ones to get.",bass,positive
"I use these mainly for watching DVD's on my portable players.  For what these cost you absolutely cannot go wrong , and they are better than many that cost a lot more.  The sound is clear, good bass response,  and they're very lightweight and comfortable.  Very highly recommended.",bass response,positive
"Just received these and trying them with Poweramp on my droid phone, they're a great set of headphones for the price.  Placido never sounded so good.  Very light weight, comfortable fit; won't fly off with a head shake.  Volume's nearly twice what it was with the cheapo airline set I was using 'til these arrived.  Glad I bought two sets.  Five stars for these more-than-adequate, bargain-priced headphones.  If they last me a year or two, I'll be happy.",weight,positive
"I must say, for the money, these are hard to beat! Cheap enough that if they stop working chuck 'em and buy some more! Mean time their sound is great! I hear details in 320 mp3's I've never heard before. It's like hearing the music for the first time!Buy them you will like them.",sound,positive

"Comfortable, light weight, good sound quality, easy to carry around and perfect for my iPad, iPhone and Roku remote - what more could you ask for?I have to add how much I hate clam shell-type packaging!

"Good sounding headphones, nice bass, awesome price! Great for aerobic workouts (treadmill, elliptical, etc) in a gym setting. ""On top of the ear"" headphones like these allow you a certain amount of awareness of your surroundings (""buds"" tend to totally isolate the user). These headphones are also quite comfortable.",price,positive
"I've had these for months now and they are great.However, as a prior reviewer noted, you must have an 'average size' head. These do not have any horizontal expansion for a person who has a 'wide' head.I have an 'average size' head (lol) and these sound great.I have thought about purchasing another pair; I like them so much.I have given two of these as gifts to friends.",sound,positive
"I bought these headphones because I kept on misplacing or breaking my expensive ones. For the price you pay, the product is great. The sound quality is good, and its no big deal if you break it because its so inexpensive. The one thing I don't like about these is that sometimes your hair will get stuck on the frame. When you try to take it off, it will also take a piece of hair with it!",sound quality,positive

"I'm not a gamer, music lover or have any huge need for an expensive pair of stereo headphones. I just want to experience decent sound from lightweight headphones when watching movies on my tablet.  That's what I get with Panasonic's RP-HT21. Nice bass sound without a tinny treble. Good price.",bass sound,positive
"I got these headphones to replace the ear buds which had short cord. I am happy with longer cord length.  The cord, frame and phones are sturdy and durable.  The comfort and sound quality are OK, but not as good as my notebook headphone set that is ten times more expensive.  These Panasonic headphones are inexpensive solution and they are worth the price.",frame,positive

"My kids broke yet another set of headphones so I pulled these out of the closet. The sound is fantastic, but they appear to be made for a baby's head--they were insanely tight. Every time I use them I bend the head band and they're finally getting comfortable but only barely.If these headphones could have slightly bigger pads and a comfortable fit, they'd be perfect.",sound,positive
"Headphones you might find at The Dollar Store! They are cheap because they are cheaply made.  Too big for any of the 5 of us in my family and the ear pieces are too small to fit over an average adult's ear.  Don't be misled by these other positive reviews, I would be surprised if you were happy with these headphones.",ear pieces,negative
"A decent sound, definitely not the best but very decent for the money",sound,positive
"The sound leaks like crazy.  I originally bought these thinking  the slim profile can help me listen to my iPod while lying down in bed.  They are useful if you like the whole world to know what your listening to, and they are a step up from cheap United Airlines headphones that you get on long distance flights.",sound,negative

"I have a pair at home and at work.For me, bass response and midrange tone are really important for enjoying music.Most inexpensive headphones sound tinny and flat. These sound good.And if I lose or break them, who cares? I'll just buy 4 more pair.Too cheap and too good to pass up.",bass response,positive
Great sound for the money. Heavier construction than other phones within this price range. The cord and plug have been without problems. I keep a spare on hand and they seem to work for a fairly long time.,sound,positive
"For such a cheap little thing, bass sounds good. It seems to me that the overall volume is not so strong, but maybe its with all headphones. For the price its a good buy.",price,positive

"For the price these are great.  They have good sound quality.  I bought some to put in the car and don't care if the kids destroy them.  I like not using earbuds all the time, and this is a great solution.  I've had one pair for about 2 years and they are lasting well.",sound quality,positive

"I have only had it for a month now. The quality of sound is good and very clear, and the volume of my iPod does not seem to impede the output of sound. Most of the time, I wear the Panasonic lightweight headphones while running/jogging, and it fits snugly on my head, making it perfect for exercising. The cord is quite long, so I usually wrap it around the iPod to make it fit better in my pockets.",quality of sound,positive

This is just what I was looking for - an inexpensive high-quality set of headphones.  It fits on top of your head (traditional - the way I like it) as opposed to behind your head.  Great sound quality.,sound quality,positive
price was right for what I am using the headphones for. Using them at work for employees to listen to training videos. Good sound for the price,price,positive
They are lightweight and the sound is good. Since the actual ear pieces are convex and do not fit to the ear they can slide off a little too easily.,sound,positive
"I've bought these repeatedly. The sound is great, and frankly I break headphones constantly (I enjoy mowing, working outside while listening to music). So the price and the quality are perfect.",sound,positive
I still can't believe that I paid less than $5 for these quality Panasonic headphones. I didn't expect them to be so nice for the price. The sound quality is incredible. They are very durable and feel great on my head. I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I ordered a few more for the kids. I wish that everything this cheap was so well-made.,sound quality,positive
I was looking for a pair of inexpensive headphones to wear while using my treadmill.  I typically replace them every year or so since the perspiration from my walking tends to cause the foam ear pieces to deteriorate.  This pair was within my budget and I opted to give it a try.  Very comfortable fit since the ear pieces swivel nicely about the head piece.  The sound quality is also excellent...bright treble and midrange and full bass. Great value.,sound quality,positive

"One problem I've had with a lot of headphones is the wiring from the audio jack connection to the ear pieces seems to come loose. Some headphones have been a little more durable than others. These seem about average in durability so far, and the sound quality is okay though nothing remarkable. If you're an audiophile, obviously you'd want to look at other options. But for the average listener who wants an inexpensive pair of headphones, these are okay.",sound quality,neutral
"As so many others have already said, these are really good headsets at really good price, so a GREAT VALUE.But no one's mentioned how nicely they self-adjust to your ears.  The ear 'pieces' tilt and twist a bit, so they go nicely right against your ears, which I'm sure helps them sound better.",price,positive
"First off, these are not $100 headphones; but the quality of sound is way better than I expected.  So much so, that I bought a 2nd pair as backup.  For under $10 I do not think you can do better.",quality of sound,positive
I was amazed at the quality of the sound from these inexpensive headphones. Even the bass is decent. They are also comfortable to wear.,sound,positive
The headphones do the job. Now that I have a new laptop with louder sound I don't need them as much.,sound,positive

I can't recommend these highly enough, especially for the price.",sound,positive
Great sound for a great price. I didn't require much from these headphones. I'm mostly using them to listen to audio books and FM radio while I walk. It has a nice long cord (but not too long!) and is definitely more comfortable than the earbuds my CD player came with.,cord,positive
"They work fine.  The sound is good. I find them more comfortable than ear plugs for long time use.  Of course they are bulkier than ear plugs. They are light weight and have very good sound.  The sound is not as good as the expensive ear-muff kind, but for what they are, they are good, IMHO.",sound,positive
These headphones worked as well as or better than other headphones I have spent more money on. I wold highly recommend them.,headphones,positive
"I was looking for 'stereo' and hear you have it.  I was looking for comfort and a nice cord, has that, also.  What I miss was the controlling the volume, but that would have cost lost more.  The price and comfort make up for that.  Recommend.",cord,positive
I don't have a lot to say here. There are no cons for this. the sound is great and the cable is long so that you're not getting jerked around when you're listening. I use these at my desk at work and I love them. I'd recommend these and I might buy another pair to have at home. There is no better buy for the price because I don't like in-ear earphones.,cable,positive
"Ordered these from Amazon because I could no longer find them in local stores.  These headphones have great sound no matter what I'm listening to, and they're durable.  I stuff them into drawers, bags, under pillows, and they keep working.  One pair usually lasts me from twelve to eighteen months.  Really worth the money.",sound,positive

"Wow!  I actually had to throw these away.  The sound was fine, but I could not get comfortable when I wore them.  Maybe the plastic was deformed?  I don't know.  Maybe I just have a wierd head!  Ha.

While they cannot quite compare to the more expensive ones, you certainly are getting a solid product for the price you're paying.I am satisfied by how the comfort level and sound quality featured by these headphones, in accordance to how much I paid.

I returned this because the headphone jack didn't connect well with my samsung smart phone. I use the phone with several other sets of headphones and don't have this problem with any of them.  If I compare the plug with the other headphones that work I can't see a difference so I'm assuming that it's minor but enough to cause  a problem.,headphone jack,negative

It's just a few notches down as compared to Sony MDR710/Sennheiser PX 200II. But has good bass as compared to PX 200, which cost ten times more!",bass,positive

I am not a fan of mp3 soundless sound. I am not a fan of most of today's sound. It lacks the depth and bottom end which makes the music for me. these headphones have an interesting range of sound including bottom end. I bought two pairs and plan on buying more. they are like the phones we used to get w/ portable cassette players - not all that sturdy but they are affordable and sound great.,range,positive
I've had these headphones for about a month now. The sound is great and I've had no problems so far.UPDATEI wrote this review in October and Its now July.

"Just briefly:1) It is very comfortable and adjustable line over the head has little grip shape left and right which makes it easy to arrange the proper shape over the ears.2) Sound is decent clear with a good BASS3) The price is just affordable4) Just get it...P.S3.5 mm jack is angle shape, or to say ankle shape, like otherwise the straight 3.5 jack (most of iPod original headphones are straight 3.5 mm jacks)",BASS3,positive
"Excellent sound for this price.  Not the best,  but I got it for $4.  including shipping.  This is really what Chinese headphones should sell for anyway,  but don't.  Remember,  even at this price they're still making profits or they wouldn't sell them.",sound,positive

"This is a good product for the price offered. Although many people don't use these types of headphones anymore, I believe this is a good choice for use at home.

"I bought two sets about six months ago because they were cheap.  While the sound is good, the fit is terrible.  Both failed within four months--likely due to stress on the cords.  They also don't have a volume control and they are not good for television watching, if that's what you had in mind. I believe they are under warranty, but at this price, it's not worth the postage to send them to Sony.",cords,negative

These have about 60 to 65% the sound quality of my Sennheiser HD555 for about 5% the price. Of course I do miss the other 35 to 40% but for my Zune HD these work well at the gym where I would look silly with my HD555.,sound quality,positive

I needed a lightweight set of headphones for computer gaming (as not to annoy the neighbors) and also a set to do guitar over-dubbing on my 4 track recorder.

I just did. Highly recommended.,sound,positive
I wanted to buy inexpensive headphones that worked fairly well and I would not be upset if they got lost or broken. These fit that objective perfectly.

"For the price these headphones are a nice purchase. I tried them on several products...different mp3 players, laptop computer, desktop computer, and even my GPS unit. The sound was very good in each instance and responsive to equalization changes made on my mp3 players. Decent bass response with clear tones otherwise. I recommend these headphones highly for good sound and over-the-ear comfort.",comfort,positive

They are very light, so the top of my head does not hurt from long hours of usage.",shipping,positive

The 7x power is good, less vibration effect compared to 8x and 10x.This factory-refurbished product is a great deal for the money.  Recommended.",Center focus lever,positive

A good &#34;BIRDING&#34; Binocular, I use the for &#34;BOATING&#34;, they don't take up a lot of room like larger 7 x 50 binoculars do, at 7 x 35 they have the same view as 7 x 50 (you won't be able to tell the DIF bet. 35 and 50 Fld of view).

Other reviews weren't lying; this game works!  My daughter had no interest in math and I've watched her interest and math skills jump the past few weeks as she's played.

She is four--will be five next week--and it has been a great game for us!,game,positive

We were looking for something to reinforce addition and subtraction.  This game is a great tool.  It only goes up to 6 on each dice so you can only go as far as 12 but still has really helped.

I'm a much bigger fan of the Targus folding keyboard.  For starters it folds into the size of a handspring.  Second of all the Landware version's keys are incredibly small.

"I'm just an amateur. I admittedly have not taken a lot of photos with this lens, but the ones that I have taken have turned out fairly nice.I'm starting to take more outdoors photos, so having a lens like this was important to get a closer view of things that happen to be far away.

I love this lens for my Canon 50D.  I bought it to replace a Tamron 70-300mm.  It was a good lens but it started giving me error readings on my camera. Since I have been using the Canon 75-300 I have not gotten any messages.  Good quality and reasonable price.,lens,positive

I couldn't ask for a better telephoto lens to start out w/. I'm sure this probably isn't the best lens for some higher end professional shots, but for starting out, especially w/ portraits this is an awesome lens. I'd definitely recommend it to other beginning photographers.",lens,positive

It is perfect for the amateur photographer without a lot of money.",money,positive

All my distance shots are &#34;fuzzy&#34;  As a test, I took a shot at mid range or 150 mm and magnified it with standard photo editing software.  All the detail was fuzzy.  I took another lens and performed the same test and the magnified image was sharp.  I now have a rather pricey paper weight.",Lens,negative

"I upgraded from a 80-200 to this lens and have really appreciated the extra range.

I bought this lens specifically for still close-up photography. It's a great value and is the typical solid Canon quality that I expected. Pleas keep in mind this lens does NOT have IS (Image Stabilization) so it can be tricky to get clear shots without use of a tripod. This is a great lens to add to your Canon Camera.,quality,positive

"I love how perfect this lens is for photographing and even filming sports. I am not a fan of the auto focus mechanism, but otherwise it is perfect.

Not a lot I can say about this lens other than it is typical Canon in that it does what it is supposed to. You get more than what you pay for with this lens because of the auto focus feature. Not all telephoto lenses are equal especially not equal to a Canon. I highly recommend this lens.,auto focus feature,positive
So far so good.  I have only had a chance to use this lens a few times.  So far it works fine and the pictures and zoom application are as expected.  The only down point was that the shipment took forever 3 plus weeks to arrive.  It was not the fault of the vendor but rather the carrier.  I would and will buy more products from this vendor.,pictures,positive
Takes great telephoto shots while using a tripod. If looking to take these kind of photos without a tripod you may want look into one with IS unless you have a steady hand.

awsome for close ups this takes very good pictures. its not that heavy either. i use this itme with my cannon rebel xs,pictures,positive
I was worried about purchasing this older model of the Canon Flashes since i didn't know if it was compatible with newer rebel DSLR cameras. After researching and getting nothing on google i took a leap of faith and walla! It works wonderful with my Rebel T3! Its sturdy and works wonderful. I just thought i'd write a review on this flash and the compatibility in case there is someone else like me wondering.,works,positive
i purchase this used and the company is awesome. It didnt come with the box but its working good. You have to buy a canon flash for your canon camera. This will adjust and made for canon so you dont have to do a lot of ISO adjustments...,working,positive
"Get these binoculars, if you can afford them.  I have looked at, or through, Zeiss and Leicas, and the Canon's are of equal quality.The image stabilization works, period.  You can see detail that is NOT possible without IS.  Also, the binoculars are very usable without the IS feature, more so than I would have thought.My suggestion, buy the highest magnification that will fit your application, since IS gives the greatest benefit at higher powers.",image stabilization,positive
Simply Amazing!  Great field of view and easy focus.  Best binoculars I have ever used.  I have used regular 18x50 binoculars in the past and always found it challenging to hold the image steady watching sporting events. The stabilization feature is terrific.  The rock solid image is definitely worth the cost.,stabilization feature,positive
"These are nice optics! So, Canon, why not include dust lens covers?! Come on!Buyers: plan on purchasing pairs of screw on UV filters to protect the coated optices and lens caps!",filters,neutral
"Great optics. Surprisingly bright and excellent for star gazing. I can actually see the moons of Jupiter with them.Issues- Protective caps don't stay on.. ever- Sucks up batteries pretty quickly- A bit heavyStill 5 stars. One of my all-time favorite expensive purchases.[update]To get caps to stay on, purchase UV filters for the lens. These lens fit standard camera filters size 52mm. Then the caps fit nicely. Also, protects the lens from accidental scratches.",optics,positive
Pros: great reach for the price. Feels well made in my hands. Takes nice pictures. very little if any distortion on the edges of my pictures.Cons: Higher F stop means it struggles under low light conditions.All in all its pretty much exactly what I expected.,pictures,positive
"I'm a causal photographer and I love this lens. I take all sorts of different pictures, majority of them outdoors.",lens,positive
"Was a great lens for shooting candids at outdoor events, but next time I'll get something with a better aperture for a nice blur in the background. At f4.5, all the people in the background were too clear and it took away from the subject.So- great lens, just didn't work for candids in a crowd like I had hoped. Live and learn.",lens,positive
"I bought this lens on the advice of the other reviewers, and I was not at all disappointed. This is a fantastic lens for what you pay. It is indeed a light light lens and it almost feels ""cheap,"" but it functions great and takes great shots. When focusing manually, it doesn't feel as smooth as some other lenses. But you really can't go wrong with this lens.",lens,positive
"What a great flash. I am going to replace my studio lights with these little babies. Powerful and controllable, all that's missing is modeling light. I have been using a miniature flashlight to act as a modeling light.",flash,positive
"The best feature of this flash is the wireless E-TTL feature.  With two 550ex's one will work as a master and one as a slave and with the ST-E2 both flashes can be off camera and fired E-TTL.  The draw backs are: price, no manual control in slave mode for greater light control, and size (this thing is big).  The plus side weighs out the negatives.  It is a great flash.",E -,positive
"Top of the line.  Works as advertised.  TTL, E-TTL.  4 double AA batteries.  Tilt, Rotate head, soft lens built in.  Can control slave flash.",lens built,positive
"Use it on my T2i and with another 550 in wireless mode.  Love it, works very well, good features and function.",works,positive
I've been using this for about 4 months now and it's serving it's purpose well. the cleaning tip takes out the smudges well and the retractable brush is gentle enough on your lens.this tool is a must have for all photographers and this product is doing great considering its price.,retractable brush,positive
Never had one of these before..  easy to carry and use and really works a treat !I searched around until I found a marker cap that fits the brush end so dirt can't get into retracted brush between uses.  they should have done that but none of the brands do that I've seen.Good item..Caution;  Some other well known brands of the SAME tool can cost over $20 and seem to be the same Mfg.,carry,positive
Works as described.  Good construction for a plastic brush pen.  Nothing bad to say about it.  It wiped off marks on the front element.  You def purchase again.,construction,positive
"Who needs ANOTHER cleaning kit? This one does it all. Very handy lens cleaning tool easily used to remove dust, fingerprints, smudges, etc. from your lenses.  Buy two - one for the camera bag and one for the home.  A must have.",lens cleaning tool,positive
"Will be ordering a few more!!!Not just for lenses though,anything that gets dust,sand,dirt etc.Safely removes dangerous particles. Just remember to keep IT clean.",lenses,positive
I've used Lens Pens since they were introduced. The chamois end is great for smudges and I've never damaged a lens coating with it. I never use the brush end since it is rather coarse. I prefer a bulb blower and a goat hair artist's brush.,lens coating,positive
These pens work great for cleaning camera lens' and they fit into most cases so you can take it with you.  would purchase again,pens,positive
"Very useful tool, works great! It was able to clean the edges of my lens that regular lens paper can't. The brush is made of soft bristles so it won't scratch your lens plus it's retractable. It seems this Sima lens pen is also the same as the Nikon lens pen that sells for $20!",brush,positive
"It works, it works!  Great antidote for curious young fingers and clumsy old ones.  And you can carry it anywhere, as you would a thick pen with a good clip.Note that Nikon sells an identical item for slightly more.  Actually, the plastic slider button is a different color, but otherwise it is identical.  I wonder who the OEM is?",clip,positive
"I had this Olympus for many years now and it's still working GREAT!  After Olympus, I've owned PowerShot, Finepix (2 of them) and I have to say this C3000 is still my favorite!  It's the only camera I know that allows zoom function while recording video.",working,positive
"I've clicked away through Costa Rica, Ireland, Lake Tahoe (skiing - finally lost the easily popped-off lens cap) and many other places.

"An external antenna is a must. I take this with me whether I use my car or someone elses car, or a rental-- I consider it worth the ""trouble"" of carrying it around. You really never know when you will absolutely need it, and I'd rather have it with me than not.Cobra is a good brand name, and I am happy with this hand-held.",external antenna,positive
"After I changed the Midland 18-2424 antenna from a PL-249 plug to a BNC plug with an inexpensive Radio Shack adapter, I plugged in, turned on and started receiving chatter from miles away. Haven't figured out the greatest possible distances yet but I have not had any trouble picking up more talk than I can listen to. Transmits well - have not had a problem speaking to truckers from my car. Love it!",Transmits,positive
"This is a nice quality radio, I really appreciate the solid feel at has.  I use it ATVing or on road trips with more than one vehicle.  My wife commutes a good distance, and in the winter this is in her car.  It makes me happier knowing that she can call for help if she needs too.",radio,positive
"This handheld cb radio is AWSOME, it comes with a rubber intena, a car power supply for on the road use, and some packs on how to use and the rules. PROS AND CONSPros:Small,Manny Channels,able to scan the channels,Able to have different antenna attachments,10 weather channels.Cons:Only about a 2.5 mile range when lots of trees and houses are around,Antenna is a bit small for range.But all in all this radio is great!",Channels,positive
This item was packed fine and arrived in working order. Takes too many batteries and does not get full power output as described.,batteries,negative
"This is not a high end unit but it works great for camping and road trips with other cars in your group. I really like the weather channel. I only use the cigarette lighter for power because this thing will go through batteries like Obama through your tax dollars. Very quick delivery,",delivery,positive
We carry when we are outside our pilot cars to talk to the truck driver while helping to park or manuver a oversize load. Some states require us to have a handheld CB so I pick the best. the price on amazon is the best any where.  I would recommend the cobra to any one.,price,positive
We bought this radio as a backup to our mobile radio in case our unit failed.  But we have used it as a loaner to others in the group that did not have radios.  It has worked great!,radio,positive
Awesome!  Setup is quick. Works great with my ipaq 1910 !!!,Setup,positive
"This keyboard feels very much like a regular fullsize keyboard. I found it easier to use than the smaller versions. The keys have a great feel to them, and your hand rests comfortably in position. There are even places to put your stylus. I love this thing!",keys,positive
"I take great pride in my ability to write quickly using the Visor's built-in handwriting recognition software. But I can type a heck of a lot faster than I can scribble, so I use this keyboard whenever I can.

Unfortunately, it did not work with my Visor Deluxe and so far I have been unable to understand why.The trouble started when I went to sync and discovered that there was no HotSync button anywhere on the cable.  Unable to start the process, I gave up.",HotSync button,negative

I bought this product after some friends of mine recommended it to me. It took me less than 30 minutes to get evenrything up and running. I have 3 PCs and a laptop and I now have internet access from all the m/cs.  Very simple configurations and easy to set up and works great! I highly recommend it.,configurations,positive
"The S100 is simply amazing.  If the camera were any smaller, it would be difficult to use.  And the price is very reasonable, especially when you consider that it comes with a rechargable lithium ion battery and a  charger.  In the past, you would have to spend around $100 for just the  battery and charger.",price,positive
"And I still use it, though in a soft rubber waterproof case. It works MUCH better than the inexpensive toy digital cameras intended for snorkeling. The original and a second battery that I bought when the camera first came out are still working fine. There's a 128MB compact flash card in the camera that just stays in there. For most photography have long since moved on to Canon DSLRs, but this is still handy when diving or snorkeling.",battery,positive

I have the dishwasher set to heated dry time in order to sanitize the bottles and the tape has survived five cycles so far without melting or moving.  It's wonderful.The print is clear and not runny and because the laminate is placed over the printing, it continues to look as great as when I first printed them.",print,positive

"I bought the 285 based on an endorsement by the authors of a book on flash photography. Big mistake. First, the flash head is so big you'll find a hard time finding diffusers that will fit it. Second, the instruction manual is almost useless. Next making adjustment to power is needlessly cumbersome, and finally the recycle time is almost 10 seconds!  I bought a Yongnuo and found it superior in every way.",recycle time,negative
"Can't beat it for the money.  There's a little learning curve with the manual settings, but my results with it have been outstanding.  It's very much worth the upgrade over your built in flash.",money,positive

I've had this flash about a month now. I've been pretty happy with it and it does everything I need to do with an off camera flash. Great price.,price,positive
"Overall a really good flash for beginners and experienced photographers alike. If you're used to an automatic flash this may not be the best option for you, as everything is controlled by the user. However, if you would like to learn more about flash photography (especially off-camera lighting), you can't beat the value of this unit.",value,positive
Works great. Good buy. Found it with you at a great price. I would recommend it to others who have the need.,price,positive
"It really would be nice if they specified which camera's these work with, because this flash does not work with Pentax K-7.  The manual itself is as confusing as trying to read it in spanish.

If you like film photography as I do, and have not tried Fuji products, I highly recommend firing off a test roll.  Thanks for reading.Tony",pricing,positive

nice nice nice.  For a fast film this has good color and seems to be forgiving on the exposure.  We use it for karate picts where we don't want the flash.  Since costco still develops and puts on DVD using this is not expensive and makes the kids think before they snap a picture.,color,positive
"I love to shoot this film indoors with my SMC Pentax-M 50mm f/1.4 lens on one of my Pentax bodies for available-light shots. The colors are good and the grain is minimal.

It went downhill from there:  The underwater pictures were not worth it.  Out of all the pictures, there was only one of my dog splashing into the pool that is kinda keeper.  But, it's 6 bucks.

I took this to hawaii. went snorkeling and got pretty good pics. I had to get used to winding it after every picture as its a 35mm camera but it held up great under water.

Fit's the Canon T2i no problem. Pouch under the lid will hold memory cards and the small extras. Outside pouch is very roomy. Strap is a little stiff but I think it will work in over time. The low price makes this an excellent buy.,price,positive
This bag holds my nikon FM3a with a Tamaron 24-135 zoom perfectly. There is just enough room left inside that I can squish my neck strap in there too. I've also found that the outside pocket has room to hold three film canisters. This bag is great if you want to fling your camera over your shoulder for a quick walk to the park or a trip to a ball game.,outside pocket,positive
This is a perfect fit for a Nikon D40 w/ an 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens.  Even has enough room to tuck in the camera's strap.,fit,positive
"I was able to fit the Canon XSI in this camera with not problem as long as I did not included the shower strap. The front pocket is big enough to fit the 270 EX flash. Looks, it looks very good and low key. Construction is great, very well built and perfect size for me.",Construction,positive
"Fits Ok, but still a bit small for the Nikon D5000 w/ kit lens, can use a little some extra space.",Fits,positive
Bought this for Nikon D40 and its a perfect fit. Comfortably holds the D40 and its kits lens with the Nikon strap inside. Holds the SD card in the inside pouch and the spare battery in the outside pouch.Cant hold the charger and its cord though. But with a spare battery and with Nikon's efficiency you dont have to charge quite often so its not a great minus.,fit,positive
"I bought this product for two reasons: first, I think it have a good design because it bag opens in form that you can hold the camera safety all the time and second, this bag fits like a glove with my camera Nikon D3000 with it's 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens attached.",design,positive

"This is a well designed minimalist type case that I would love to use except that It doesn't quite fit my Nikon D80 with my favorite lens the 18-200 AF VR lens. It would work with any of the stock 18-55 or shorter lenses. The D40 works fine in this case too. It's well made, too bad it isn't a couple of inches longer!",case,positive

"I own one each of the TLZ mini, TLZ 1, and TLZ 2. They are great walk-around bags. The mini is perfect for my Nikon D40 with the attached kit lens and a lens pen. I expect it would work well with any similar small DSLR and lens combo.",attached kit lens,positive

"Needed a good carry bag for my Nikon D40 that i purchased recently.I use it mostly with the kit lens 18-55 mm which fits snugly into this lowerpro bag.Strap & the carry case is made of durable material, and i am satisfied with the purchase.Just be sure that your DSLR is not too big for this, this case should fit most medium sized dsl'rs with kit lenses;Also has front zip pouch to keep battery/sd card etc.",material,positive
"This bag perfectly fits my canon rebel xti + kit lens, with room for a battery charger, a usb cable, a screen cleaner, some extra memory cards, etc--everything I need aside from my other lenses. There are two pockets--one outside and one inside the flap. It's portable but durable, with enough padding to protect its contents.",memory cards,positive
"I love this bag, it is the perfect for the Nikon D40 with either the 18-55 or the 55-200mm lens.  You can't fit both lens in it of course, that's not what it's for.  I also have the Nikon strap attached do my D40 and it easily fits inside this topload zoom mini bag.  I don't know what other people mean by this bag is too small, it's the perfect size.",size,positive
Strong...Samll...and a few pockets....nice.I have a Nikon D200 and 18-200mm lensThe bag works great,bag,positive
"After reading the reviews, I thought this bag would be bigger than it actually is. It really only has room for the camera with attached lens and a pocket for a few extras such as filters or cards. I would prefer a bag that can hold an extra lens, but the conical shape prevents that.",attached lens,neutral
"This bag is nice, it can easily fit my D300 with vertical grip attached. I like it and just like any lowepro product the build quality is A-1.....highly recommended.",build quality,positive
"I often go for long walks around town with my Nikon D40 camera with 18-200 zoom lens attached.

"i finally broke down late last year and purchased the DSLR camera i have wanted for years, but couldn't carry it with me on my motorcyle until i found this camera bag. it has plenty of depth to protect the lense, and room at the top for a good quality camera strap.  it fits easily in my motorcycle saddle-bags, so i can carry it on road trips when i plan one.  good product, well worth the price.",strap,positive
"I love this bag, its just perfect fit for my Kodak Z980. i put my P20 flash in the bottom, together with the charger and the reserve batterey in it. Also you can adjust the postition for the camera (the velcro inside). The price, couldn't beat it!love it, love it, love it",price,positive
"I bought this for traveling with a D300s and 17-55 2.8 attached.They fit perfectly, and there is even a couple pockets for other goodies.When I travel, I don't like having my camera out, so this case keeps it hidden and safe. When I need to take a shot, it is quick and easy to get the camera out.The D700 fits as well.Highly Recommended.",They fit,positive
I have a D40 and this bag is perfect for it and few extra items...worth the price...the texture of the bag is soft and not that hard core material.,texture,positive
"Make sure your lens is under 5.5"" otherwise there might be a good chance that it won't fit.Other than that it is an excellent bag.",bag,positive
"My SONY A100 camera with 70-210mm lens fit into this bag easily.  This camera bag is smaller enough so you can carry another bag with additional lens together.  I do not want people look at me as News person, so the plain look is OK for me.",bag,positive
Excellent day bag for my Nikon D70 w/ 70mm lens. I use the side lens carriers for extra batteries and CF cards. The bag is comfortable to wear and not very bulky.,bag,positive
"This can hold everything you need for a day hike... camera, water bottle, snacks... Or multiple lenses if you like. Comfortable to wear on the front or the back.",wear,positive
"I purchased this bag based on the reviews and was concerned whether it could/would handle my Canon Rebel XT with a Tamron 28-300mm lens.  The camera, with lens attached fit fine and the side compartments can hold my 18-55mm lens and camera accessories.  The unit is compact and light.  It serves the user well when taking a weekend trip or going on a hike as it frees up your hands while protecting the camera and lens.",user,positive
this would be great for entry level slr with shorter lenses - doesnt fit my canon 40d with any of the zoom lenses - must return it.,lenses,negative
"This is the first photo backpack I've ever had, and I'm impressed.  The quality is obvious.  It holds as much as I think I'd care to have on my back, and you can configure the dividers as you wish - it's very versatile.  No regrets on this.",quality,positive
This case is awesome.  It's very well padded to protect my husband's camera and has plenty of pockets for all of his accessories.,pockets,positive
"This compact tripod fufills all my needs, except for table top usage.  It's a well made product that sets-up and folds-up for storage quick usage or storage.  All of this at a really low price.",price,positive
Weighs in at only 1kg. Nice quality construction.  Infinitely adjustable leg length.  I combined with with a Gorillapod with ball-head and bubble level. The ball-head is transferrable so I can use it on this Velbon as well.,construction,positive
"I have an LG projector, that I also purchased through Amazon, permanently attached to this tripod.  It is the perfect setup that allows me to go mobile with my projector, and keeps me from needing to mount it in my home.  Quality construction.",setup,positive
"Very solid construction.Works 100%.Looks great.When not in use, works as a techno-sculpture on top of a bookcase  :)Absolutely recommend it!",construction,positive
"I got this for doing macro shots close to the ground. There are better ways to do this, but this is a lot cheaper than a bigger tripod that can get down low. It's also a nice travel tripod - it's light and small.On the downside, it's pretty much plastic. And heavier SLRs are at it's limit. But - for the price and the fact that it doesn't pretend to be more, it does the job.",price,positive
I looked around and after reading the reviews i picked this up and was not disappointed.The fluid head is very smooth for pans and tilts. A surprise feature was the quick release which locks open when the plate is removed so all you have to do is slide the plate back in and it snaps locked.The only concern i have is that is made up of a lot of plastic but hey for the price what do you expect.,fluid head,positive
I am a professional wedding videographer and this is always my go-to tripod. It's light enough to easily carry around but large and sturdy enough to get the job done. They're also priced affordably so I always have at least two of these.,carry,positive
The friction HEAD is not the greatest but this tripod works fine for a pro traveling for a light job,tripod,positive
This is a well made economical tripod.  While best suited to a video camera it worked well for my DSLR as well.,tripod,positive
"The Velbon 607/F is a pretty nice tripod, especially for the money. I have been using it for a few months and really like it. The panning is smooth and the quick release platform is really nice.Pros:- smooth panning- quick setup- comes with a carrying bag- lightweightCons:- Since its lightweight you have to hold on to it when your panning sometimes because it jerks a little bitOverall, its a great buy.",quick release platform,positive
"Tripod worked well and seemed sturdy. However, after six months (about 5 uses), an internal plastic part broke on a leg clamp. Now it is non-functional.Off to the company website: After two layers of company's deep (Velbon, and HakubaUSA), I find a service page. Email using the provided link. Bounces: 'Mailbox Full'. Try to call: ""We're sorry, we are unable to take your call."". Hmmmm. This one may be heading to the dumpster after just five uses.",Tripod,neutral
I bought Velbon years ago and loved the smoothness of the panning and tilt. I have tested  others in the store and they all were very jerky to pan and tilt. I recently bought another Velbon and after all these years the smoothness in Velbon has not changed. I love it and the carrying case.,carrying case,positive
"Relatively lightweight, solid for its weight, and has wonderfully smooth pans. I've had it only a week and am already wondering how I did without it. The fluid pan head makes a HUGE difference in following the action while zoomed - good-bye to herky-jerky videos at last! The carry case makes it a lot more portable than I expected. I upgraded from a tripod that cost 1/3 as much, and it's well worth the extra. Highly recommended.",pans,positive
"This is a video tripod, but I've used it with relative success with my DSLR.  The product works exactly as advertised, it's lightweight yet durable, and it's held up to at least a year of being luggesd around to various events.  This isn't professional quality by any means, but it's a great entry level tripod for video cameras.",works,positive

This hard to find product was exactly what I was looking for. Amazon really does have everything!,Amazon,positive
I have bought ten of these cases for my CD collection. Consistent quality and a must for packing away your music. Zippers are solid and the case is easily stacked or lined up on a shelf.,Zippers,positive

These cable ties do the job.. would purchase more in the future if needed. Use it for every day work since I am a mobile worker and carry all sorts of cables to different client sites.,cable ties,positive
"I was attracted to the colors and I bought them. However, since  the hook part of the cable tie is very small, it does not give me the same flexibility that the cable ties that I bought at Walmart do. And they are all the same size, unlike what is shown in  the picture.",cable,negative
These hold the cables but they are a pain to roll and unroll...once rolled up the want to keep that formso you have to keep trying to stretch them out from the rolled up form when you try to use them again.,cables,neutral
Great quality. The variety of colors makes it easier to distinguish cords. I use these for separating cords within a photobooth.,colors,positive
"I use these cable ties to make my workspace neater, make our cables for our networking equipment,  and also to make the cables in our entertainment center neater, and they work well, and best of all, are reusable, so if I need to add or remove a cable, it's as easy as undoing a few cable ties.",cable ties,positive
cleaned up the area--no more tangled wires to look at--can use anywhere--always keep handy even when traveling-will buy again.  love them,wires,positive
They are good wire ties.  A little long and need to be trimmed for most applications or you are wrapping a wire bundle multiple times but better too long than too short.,wire ties,positive
"Yes, I would recommend this product does what is says it is going to do ..looks good and works.....try them you will be happy...",looks,positive
These are what you'd expect from velcro cable ties but I prefer these to the velcro brand version.  They have tags that allow the tie to be easily removed and do not attach throughout the cable but only on a small section near the end of the cable.  This allows you to more easily wrap a cable and hold it tighter then the velcro brand straps.  Definitely recommend!,tags,positive
"They work, but, the strip only has the second side of Velcro on the end, so you have to wrap the entire thing around the cords before it secures. When the cords aren't all that thick then the tie is loose and doesn't really hold the wires all that well. I should have just spent the money on a roll of tape.",roll of tape,neutral
"These are perfect for my needs; wrapping a few cables.  Strips are about 1/2&#34; thick and about 6&#34;-7&#34; long.  Great price, quick shipping.",shipping,positive
"Unlike other velcro sleeves, these do not have the option of attaching to the cable, which makes it inconvenient if you want to use it in a situation where you want to take it off and on frequently.",cable,neutral
Why didn't I think of this? I used tie wraps then when I moved the computer I cut the tie wraps and redid them. Now I can add / remove the velcro ties easy! then use them again..............really a good idea to make life easier!,velcro ties,positive
"Cables are always a hassle. Laptop power cord (actually 2 cables), phone charger cable, even that rats nest behind the computer, these keep things neat and tidy.",phone charger cable,positive
its all right for the price but like the flexi ties cable wrap better than this. this isnt that neat a purchase. it works and does the job but doesnt keep em together all the time.,price,positive
The picture and description of the product come up short. There is a use for theses just not for me. Regular Velcro ties are more functional than these. Colors fancy smancy and no big deal for my needs.,Velcro,neutral
"These work but they're very expensive and can't be &#34;permanently&#34; attached to the cable for future unwrapping and rewrapping.I've converted to Velcro Reusable Self-Gripping Cable Ties and find that giving up color for many, many more slightly better designed ties was a good move.",color,negative

I have had mine for over a year now and it still works great.  It comes with a good long lasting battery the NP-FM50.My only complaint is that the included memory stick is only 4MB.  At high resolution (1600x1200) you would only be able to take about 4 pictures.  I bought a 64MB stick the very same day and have had great success.,battery,positive
"I still rate it 4 stars because of the quality of the sound, the reliability of the cassette decks and the low price. Sony has been making this same product for several years with no changes, so that means it's great, right?",of the sound,positive
For its size it has good sound.  I connected it to some external speakers instead of the ones it came with and it works fine.  The included remote is a bonus although it doesn't seem to control the cassette player.,sound,positive
"I had this stereo 3 years before I sold it. Great CD player,greatcassette recorder,and great radio. The CD player didn't skip, andthe cassette player made great recordings. Both the G500 and theZW755 are great systems, but the cassette player is better on theZW755, partly because it was a duoble deck and you could recordoff of the other deck. This is a great portable unit! Way to goSony!",duoble deck,positive
"This is a great case for theCanon PowerShot A470 7MP Digital Camera with 3.4x Optical Zoom (Gray). Good padding and protection. Camera fits snug and the small pocket will hold four rechargeable AA batteries. The camera only needs two at a time, so you have good backup power.",padding,positive
"I bought this carry case for our point-and-shoot Kodak digital camera.  The quality and value are terrific.If you own a small point-and-shoot camera - seriously consider getting this bag.  Just compare the dimensions of the bag and your camera first, to make sure the camera will fit inside it.",value,positive
"I love the compact size of this camera bag.  It holds everything I need for those trips where I don't need my large camera bag.  The size also allows me to store this bag inside my large camera bag. I always know where it is, and it is always ready for me to grab and go.",bag,positive
"We have had this little case for six years and it is still a very nice bag.  Durable and protective, we highly recommend it.",bag,positive
"Well aside from what has been said, I will say the velcro part could be annoying, however it is big and secure enough to make you feel safe for the avg user who wants just a camera and nothing more professional, has extra storage for batteries and your usb cable. All in all, better then nothing and good for the value. You wont feel the need to get rid of it anytime soon.",value,positive
Excellent item that protects my digital camera well; Has nice sized external pocket to carry extra batteries (4 AA) and extra memory card. Very durable and still looks new after 2.5 years of use.

"This think is as big as a USB flash drive, but is very helpful. Every Pentaxian must have it. K20D has an infra red sensors on the front and on the back of the camera, so you do not need the expensive wireless one. The camera AF works well before taking the sot! Buy it!",AF,positive
"This is a great item considering the price, size, and functionality. Don't forget the menu setting which allows auto focus to activate just before the images is taken.
