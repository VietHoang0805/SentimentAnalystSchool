This item is cool it even comes with a charger cord for the cigarette lighter in your car. My only problem is that the quality on these types of transmitters suffers sometimes.  It will get distorted after a few minutes and then it is useless. I dont know if it is just my car or what so I can't say for sure if it is the fault of the product.  it's really little and cute though!,None,neutral

"This new model is a significant improvement over their older (white, ps2-plug) edition.  The soft textures have the feel of high quality.  The keys have a sure over-center action.  Easy installation with USB connect.  The only flaw: a sticky space-bar key.  Perhaps problem will fade after it's broken in a bit.

"But I really only bought it for the sub, as I already have two near-field studio monitors.As a system, the output is pretty weak. As the other reviewer mentioned, there is a real lack of midrange.

"The case fits snugly with my u-Tough 8000 camera but does not provide the amount of protective cushioning that I would have liked.

"I have had these for a few weeks and love the sound they reproduce, but I don't care for the piece itself. The shape of the earpiece does not fit correctly in the ear and therefore consistently falls out. Luckily I bought them for $4.99 and not the full retail. Maybe people with siphon shaped ear canals will have a better fit with this. (LOL).",None,neutral

"This light uses LED bulbs which means it uses less battery energy to run. The unit is small and handy to use. But the big draw back is the actual light. It gives off a very cold looking light. The other problem is that it does NOT give enough light.For very close shots, it is probably good, but longer shots produce very poor lighting.Overall a very nice unit but if it only produced more light!!!",None,neutral
